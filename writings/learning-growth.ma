      "In October 1952 the beloved Guardian announced to the Bahá’í world the
      imminent launching of a “fate-laden, soul-stirring, decade-long,
      world-embracing Spiritual Crusade” aimed at “the immediate extension of
      Bahá’u’lláh’s spiritual dominion as well as the eventual establishment of
      the structure of His administrative order” in all sovereign states and
      dependencies scattered over the surface of the entire planet. The response
      of the followers of Bahá’u’lláh to the Guardian’s call during the Ten Year
      Crusade and to plans subsequently given to them by the Universal House of
      Justice constitutes a glorious chapter in the history of the Faith, one
      which future generations will contemplate with pride and wonder. After the
      lapse of but a few decades, it can be asserted without reservation that
      Bahá’u’lláh’s spiritual dominion has indeed been extended throughout the
      world and the structure of His administrative order established.",
    ],
    [
      "In a century and a half, the growth of the Faith has followed various
      patterns in accordance with the exigencies of time and place. In the
      Cradle of the Faith, during the early years of the Heroic Age, this growth
      displayed characteristics unprecedented in religious history. The
      galvanizing and ennobling influence of the Báb and Bahá’u’lláh spread with
      extraordinary swiftness throughout the country, setting souls aflame,
      elevating them to the loftiest heights of sanctity, inspiring them to acts
      of heroic sacrifice, and generating, at the same time, the fiercest and
      most persistent opposition that followers of a new religion ever had to
      face. The growth of the Bahá’í community in Irán continued throughout the
      Heroic Age, though its outward manifestations were curtailed by relentless
      persecution. Energies had to be focused increasingly on the pursuit of
      spiritual and material education, and on the establishment of vibrant
      Bahá’í communities that were to bring renown to the Iranian friends for
      the purity of their lives, the rectitude of their conduct, and the
      loving-kindness they showed even to their enemies. During the Ten Year
      Crusade these sorely tried believers were presented once again with the
      opportunity to contribute significantly to the expansion of the Faith,
      this time through pioneering. Thousands of them arose, and along with
      their co-religionists, particularly those from North America, propagated
      the Message of Bahá’u’lláh throughout the planet.",
    ],
    [
      "In the latter years of the Heroic Age, as the Faith spread to other
      countries of the world, especially those in the West, a distinctive
      pattern of growth emerged. In locality after locality, the Faith was
      introduced to a small nucleus of believers; they were gradually helped to
      achieve the status of a Local Spiritual Assembly, and that institution was
      nurtured to assume responsibility for the expansion and consolidation of a
      growing local community and its extension into neighboring localities.
      Through the operation of this process in successive epochs of the
      Formative Age the Bahá’í community has extended itself to thousands of
      cities and towns in every region of the world. Growth, according to this
      pattern which no doubt will continue to be fruitful for decades to come,
      can be slow or rapid depending on the receptivity of the people and the
      degree to which the believers draw upon the spiritual forces that are
      always available to them. The recent efflorescence of the Faith in the
      countries of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union is fresh testimony to the
      effectiveness of this pattern.",
    ],
    [
      "Signs of yet another distinctive pattern of growth, one which echoes
      episodes of conversion in the Heroic Age, could already be discerned in
      the early years of the Ten Year Crusade. This remarkable process, which
      brought delight to the heart of the beloved Guardian, was initiated when
      the friends in Africa began to take the Faith to the inhabitants of rural
      areas and recognized their great receptivity to the Message of
      Bahá’u’lláh. Soon, entry by troops spread to other parts of the world. In
      country after country, the ranks of Bahá’u’lláh’s followers swelled,
      increasing in number from a few hundred thousand to a few million. But
      consolidating local communities while maintaining a rapid pace of
      expansion proved to be a formidable challenge for the Bahá’í community. In
      various countries the inability to meet this challenge brought the process
      of teaching the masses to a standstill, and often provoked debilitating
      disagreements on the entire subject of teaching. Although in other
      countries, the believers persevered and developed balanced approaches to
      expansion and consolidation, by the end of the 1970s a great deal of
      momentum had been lost and the pace of growth had slowed considerably on
      every continent.",
    ],
    [
      "The release of the 1988 Ridván message of the Universal House of Justice
      to the Bahá’í world, awakened a new eagerness to revitalize large-scale
      expansion of the Faith. This time, however, accumulated experience is
      producing more suitable methods for sustained expansion, and, especially
      through the activities of institutes, effective ways of deepening the
      friends in large numbers are being discovered.",
    ],
    [
      "In “Learning About Growth”, the Ruhi Institute describes its conceptual
      framework and its programs, tells the story of one national community’s
      efforts to maintain large-scale expansion, and analyzes the lessons it has
      learned. In reading it, one appreciates the fact that it makes no claim to
      present a model for emulation; its value lies in its systematic
      description of a process that in one way or another has been repeated
      wherever Bahá’ís have labored to bring about large-scale growth of the
      Faith. People, of course, need to create their own experience, and move
      with it as they learn and grow in knowledge and wisdom. Yet, the sharing
      of experience is extremely valuable. Reflection on the dynamics of the
      efforts of others yields insights into the causes of crisis and victory in
      one’s own endeavors. This document is of particular value for such
      reflection, as in telling its story, the Ruhi Institute avoids the duality
      of success and failure and analyzes its progress in terms of the constant
      interplay of crisis and victory.",

      analyze their own experience and share their perceptions with Bahá’ís

      have asked the Ruhi Institute to share with them its materials and

      more thorough presentation of our programs and their evolution. This

      friends who are working to increase the human resources of the Faith

      "During the latter years of the Nine Year Plan, large-scale teaching among
      the masses was gaining momentum in an increasing number of Latin American
      countries. Small groups of the followers of the Blessed Beauty scattered
      throughout the continent were feeling the stirrings of a forceful process
      that had begun during the Ten Year Crusade and was now spreading to
      receptive populations in rural areas and urban neighborhoods in almost
      every country of the world. As old attitudes and unfounded fears
      disappeared, these groups felt strongly attracted to the inhabitants of
      thousands of villages and towns, where numerous souls were more than ready
      to accept the Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh and join the swelling ranks of its
      adherents. In region after region, it became apparent that brief
      presentations of the basic verities of the Cause, offered with faith and
      enthusiasm, sufficed to lead significant numbers to the acceptance of the
      new message and to immediate enrollment.",
    ],
    [
      "The responses of the Bahá’ís to these teaching opportunities varied from
      exhilaration, to caution, to incredulity. But whatever the attitudes
      adopted by individuals, the new process was destined to change the face of
      the Bahá’í community across the continent. With amazing rapidity most
      national communities were thrust from their early stages when they existed
      as closely connected networks of a few small local communities, into a
      stage of unprecedented growth, an era of unforeseen challenges and new
      blessings.",
    ],
    [
      "In Colombia, about fifteen people, who comprised the entire active
      working force of that community in 1970, set out to take the Message of
      Bahá’u’lláh to the great masses of their country. Their original
      expectations were high: somehow, in a state of immense optimism and
      excitement, they had declared their intention to raise the number of
      believers in the country to 100,000 in as short a time as possible.",
    ],
    [
      "The teaching method these believers adopted was not different from what
      was being used in many other receptive areas. Small groups would enter a
      village, offer ardent prayers, walk the different pathways, and meet the
      people. Soon, the villagers would invite the Bahá’ís to their homes and
      gather some members of the family to hear a presentation that proclaimed
      the advent of Bahá’u’lláh as the new Manifestation of God for today. The
      oneness of God, the oneness of religion, and the oneness of humanity
      constituted the central theme of this presentation which, in its
      simplicity and depth, attracted the hearts of the villagers and enabled a
      teacher to enroll twenty or thirty believers in a typical day. In order to
      reinforce the enrollment process, the villagers would often be invited to
      large evening meetings that invariably were replete with sentiments of
      great joy and spiritual exaltation.",
    ],
    [
      "During this period everyone had an unwavering conviction that these new
      believers, despite their apparently limited understanding of the
      significance of the Faith, would become transformed by the very fact of
      having accepted Bahá’u’lláh, and that Local Spiritual Assemblies, by the
      very fact of having been elected, would immediately become channels
      through which God’s grace would flow to the entire village. It was
      expected that the number of Local Spiritual Assemblies would quickly rise
      to a few thousand, paving the way for a subsequent stage when the people
      of Colombia, on their own initiative, would seek out the Bahá’ís and enter
      the Faith in large numbers.",

    [
      "Although it is inevitable that sooner or later every country will see a
      vast increase in the number of Bahá’ís, the path leading to large-scale
      expansion in Colombia did not prove as straightforward as had been
      expected. The initial results were exhilarating: in the span of a few
      months, the number of Bahá’ís in the rural areas around the city of Cali
      had risen from twenty to about one thousand. During the same period,
      another two thousand believers were enrolled in four other regions,
      Tumaco, Chocó, North Coast, and settlements of the indigenous Guajiran
      tribe near the border with Venezuela. But rapid teaching success also
      engendered problems, and a condition of crisis began to emerge as the

      the teaching projects, often attended by visitors from other countries,
      were alive with passionate discussions on the nature of mass teaching and
      the relative merits of different methods and concepts. “Shouldn’t we
      concentrate entirely on expansion and worry about consolidation much
      later?” “Shouldn’t we stop expansion and immediately proceed to
      consolidate?” “If the functioning of Local Spiritual Assemblies is the key
      to the establishment of the World Order of Bahá’u’lláh, shouldn’t we
      concentrate all our efforts in that direction?” “Three thousand Bahá’ís
      are too few; maybe we should accelerate the rate of expansion. The problem
      is that not enough numbers have entered the Faith yet; once they do, all
      the problems will take care of themselves.” “What if we only concentrate
      on the nine members of the Local Spiritual Assemblies and deepen them
      first?” “The answer may be in the use of mass media, since the process of
      teaching one-by-one is proving inadequate.” These are only examples of the
      thoughts that were expressed in a genuine and sincere search for methods
      that would help a small group of Bahá’ís respond to the receptivity of

      feelings, using phrases such as “paper Bahá’ís” and “paper Assemblies” to
      deny the validity of the very concept of large-scale teaching. But,
      although few in numbers, the Colombian community was blessed with a high
      degree of unity, and its National Assembly was able to help the friends
      set aside all negative comments and concentrate only on opinions which, if
      divergent, nevertheless reflected genuine concern for the process of
      teaching among the masses. Thus, the tensions created by the challenges of
      large-scale teaching in Colombia were never allowed to cause dissension.
      The community never entered that stage of paralysis which in later years,
      unfortunately, afflicted some of its sister communities. For the Bahá’ís
      of Colombia, the basic issue was very simple: Humanity needs the healing
      Message of Bahá’u’lláh. Millions of people from among the masses in Latin
      America are willing to accept His Message. Imaginative ways, then, have to

      for the recurring cycles of crisis and victory that for years, and
      probably decades to come, would characterize large-scale expansion and
      consolidation in Colombia. The most valuable lesson learned in this first
      experience of large-scale teaching was that, in order to move consistently
      from victory to victory, the community would have to seize in every crisis
      whatever opportunities would help it to become more unified. For the next
      few months, then, while the teaching work moved along at a much slower

      concerning the nature of the activities they were moved to undertake

      would not be so much that of the brilliance of those who contributed to
      consultation, but the light of guidance which emanates from the Writings
      of the Faith. “Expressing differing opinions” would mean that individuals
      would describe the processes of expansion and consolidation as they
      understood them in light of the Writings; everyone would then try to
      integrate these views for themselves so as to render their own
      understanding broader and more complete. But everyone agreed that even in
      this process there was a very subtle danger to be avoided: that of taking
      one or two sentences from the Writings out of context and using them to
      support unfounded personal opinions. Statements such as “expansion and
      consolidation should go hand in hand” and “expansion should not be stopped
      for consolidation” were not meant to be used as arguments in debate. They

      "With a well-established unity of purpose to teach the masses and a newly
      achieved unity of thought on the nature of expansion and consolidation,
      the Colombian friends once again turned their attention to the practical
      path that would lead them to their cherished goal of large-scale
      expansion. At first, much of the consultation was directed to the search
      for a prescription that would bring about rapid success, but soon it
      became clear that such a quest was in vain and that the path to mass
      conversion would have to be pursued with constancy and discovered step by
      step. “What methods to use” was not a simple matter to be determined
      through the clash of differing opinions; it would have to be the object of
      a long learning process and approached systematically and with
      perseverance.",
    ],
    [
      "A number of important conclusions were then formulated. First, it was
      recognized that the friends would have to refrain from speculating about
      the future and abandon the habit of elaborating pet theories concerning
      the destined patterns of growth for the Faith. The community reminded
      itself that the future of the Cause of God is in the hands of Bahá’u’lláh,
      Who guides its progress with inscrutable wisdom. Faith, itself, is a gift
      that He alone can bestow; only He can confirm souls and offer them the
      privilege of serving Him. What the small group of active Bahá’ís in the
      country could do was to be thankful for the opportunities they had been
      granted to serve a highly receptive population; they only needed to
      concentrate on the quality of their own activities, and strive daily to
      work with deeper faith, devotion, and intensity. In their meetings they
      repeatedly cited the following quotation from Bahá’u’lláh and applied it
      to themselves:",

      upon his soul, will the darkness of error be dispelled, the mists of
      doubts and misgivings be dissipated, and the lights of knowledge and
      certitude envelop his
      being.”<

    ],
    [
      "The second conclusion concerned the necessity to focus attention on
      learning in action. Plans and methods could not be perfect from the
      beginning, but had to evolve and increasingly reflect the principles of
      the Faith. These principles, themselves, would progressively come to be
      understood with greater clarity as everyone pursued diligently the goals
      that were set for each stage of the teaching process. The teachers and
      administrators of the Faith had to understand that many of their tasks
      were straightforward, even simple; they would have to resist the
      temptation to exaggerate the importance and complexity of their own roles
      and contributions. The most they could expect from themselves was to
      engage wholeheartedly in an intensive plan of action and an accompanying
      process of reflection and consultation. This reflection and consultation
      had to be carried out in unshakable unity and with a spirit of utmost
      humility. The main thrust of consultation had to be the objective analysis
      of possible courses of action and the evaluation of methods and results,
      all carried out in light of the Writings of the Faith. The purpose of
      joint reflection was to seek in the unfathomable depths of the ocean of
      Revelation the answers to questions, challenges, and problems and to
      discover the next steps in a path that, if trodden with absolute faith,
      would lead to unprecedented expansion. There was little more that could be
      done by the friends; success would be a gift from Bahá’u’lláh, in some way
      related to the intensity of their efforts and the spiritual quality of
      their endeavors.",

  [
    section: 'The Unique Attributes of Large-scale Expansion',
    [
      "Yet another important conclusion reached during this period had to do
      with the very nature of teaching campaigns. The friends agreed that what
      they had experienced during those first months of large-scale expansion
      was entirely different from any teaching work in which they had previously
      participated. Success had been achieved only because several distinctive
      elements had been combined: a group of dedicated teachers in continuous
      contact with the Creative Word; constant prayer, the capacity to dedicate
      long hours to teaching every day; a spirit of great joy and happiness,
      generated through prayer and song, that would permeate an entire village
      upon the arrival of the group of teachers; freedom from any trace of
      racial or class prejudice; intense love; and profound respect for the
      people who were being invited to join the Faith. These elements created
      opportunities for a teaching process that, qualitatively, was just as
      different from individual teaching as farming thousands of acres is
      different from tending a few plants in a small personal garden. It was
      essential to understand that both types of teaching are valid, and that it
      was not correct to measure one with the parameters of the other. The
      intensity of the spiritual sentiments created during teaching campaigns
      opened new spiritual doors and made the hearts of listeners who were
      already spiritually inclined more receptive to the Faith. Was it not the
      experience of every group that on a given day the neglect of any one of
      the essential elements of group teaching ~ whether caused by disunity, by
      the influence of prejudice, or by lack of attention to prayer and use of
      the Creative Word ~ could easily close the doors of success? Had not every
      group observed that whenever a teacher forgot the true purpose of the
      campaign and became attached to a sense of glory, of superficial
      excitement and success, even after the enrollment of large numbers, in the
      end, few lasting results were obtained? Had not every sincere teacher
      observed in his or her own experience that the moment self-glorification
      entered the mind, the ability to teach and confirm was immediately and
      noticeably diminished?",
    ],
    [
      "This realization of the distinctiveness of large-scale teaching led to
      the decision to accord it a special place among the processes of growth of
      the Faith in Colombia. Never would this type of teaching be seen to
      compete with other activities such as individual teaching, proclamation of
      the Faith to political and intellectual leaders, the strengthening of
      national, regional, and local institutions, or the promotion of Bahá’í
      scholarship. The challenge facing the National Assembly was to ensure that
      each of these growth processes would achieve its own momentum and would
      interact with others so as to enhance and accelerate progress.",
    ],
  ],
  [
    section: 'The Quality of the First Contact and the Role of the Teacher',
    [
      "The ongoing analysis of experiences showed clearly that success, both in
      large-scale expansion and in the subsequent deepening of new believers,
      depended to a great extent on the quality of the first contact between the
      teacher and the seeker. In teaching campaigns among the masses this first
      contact will often be brief, yet its spiritual impact must be great: the
      flame of faith has to be kindled in a receptive heart with sufficient
      intensity to persist and grow through a deepening process which is usually
      slow and frequently interrupted. To achieve this high quality of teaching,
      the Colombian friends understood that it was necessary to include in their
      plans of action regular activities to uplift the spirits, refine the
      character, and enhance the understanding of the teachers, old and new.",
    ],
    [
      "It was well understood that in teaching among the masses, as in any kind
      of teaching effort, the teacher plays a far more crucial role than is
      usually called for in proclamation activities. If the hearts of people are
      to be connected with the Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh, the teacher’s love,
      for the seeker and for the Faith, must become the vehicle through which
      the message of the Revelation flows, penetrates the heart, and leads the
      new believer into a bond of love with the Manifestation of God for today.
      In this first, subtle interaction of human hearts, through which God
      bestows the gift of faith on a new believer, both the teacher’s words and
      the sentiments of the teacher’s heart are of great importance; one without
      the other does not lead to appreciable or lasting effects. After all,
      teaching is not the selling of a product; it is a spiritual process that
      depends on the direct action and influence of great spiritual forces.
      Teaching among the masses is not a missionary activity focused on
      conversion; it is the process through which large numbers of people are
      empowered to arise and participate in the construction of a new World
      Order.",
    ],
    [
      "It was decided, then, that the next plan of action would incorporate
      regular meetings of consultation for the participants of teaching
      campaigns, dedicated to fostering a deeper understanding of the spiritual
      qualities that an effective teacher needs to possess. To support these
      consultations, numerous passages from the Writings were selected, and
      everyone was encouraged to memorize them - short quotations at first, and
      later, entire passages and Tablets. Memorization of the Holy Writings
      eventually became a well-established tradition in the Colombian community
      and today is a cherished aspect of Bahá’í life for the believers of all
      ages, including the children. Quotations were selected and memorized with
      various purposes in mind. Some were concerned with spiritual qualities
      such as love, detachment, perseverance, patience, faith, courage,
      kindness, joy and happiness. Others were chosen to further the teachers’
      understanding of the teaching process itself; still others, to illuminate
      the dynamics of group teaching and help maintain the necessary levels of
      unity and love among the teachers. The number of quotations selected was
      large; however, a sampling of them suffices to indicate the approach to
      “teacher training” taken by the National Assembly and its committees at
      the time when the elements of a permanent teaching institute were

    [
      "While they were deliberating on the spiritual qualities which would be
      essential to the growth of the teachers, the Colombian friends were also
      consulting on the content of the message that, during the first contact,
      was to kindle the spark of faith in the seeker’s heart, and were looking
      for ways to help an increasing number of believers express their newly
      acquired knowledge of the Faith by teaching others. Consultations on the
      content of a “first message” led to the preparation of a small,
      introductory booklet with simple explanations and illustrations that could
      be easily used by those who desired to teach their families and friends.
      The booklet was not intended to present a formula for teaching, but to
      help the new believer follow a sequence of ideas known to be successful in
      enhancing a basic understanding of the Faith. Its use also ensured that
      the presentation of the message would not be reduced to the superficial
      discussion of a few principles, but would cover the points deemed
      necessary for enrollment.",
    ],
    [
      "The booklet, which, it must be remembered, was developed for a
      predominantly Catholic population, begins with praise of God as the
      Creator of all things, and introduces the concept of the Covenant as an
      expression of God’s love for His creation. In this same context, it
      explains the meaning of the word “manifestation”, and offers a short
      account of the life of Bahá’u’lláh as the Manifestation of God for today,
      emphasizing His sufferings as well as His triumph over all the powers of
      the earth. In this explanation, it also refers to Christ as a
      Manifestation of God, while avoiding words such as “prophet” or
      “messenger” which, for a Christian, would diminish Christ’s station. It
      does not refer to Bahá’u’lláh as the return of Christ, for the concept of
      return taught by the churches is misleading and its association with
      Bahá’u’lláh confuses the listeners rather than helping them formulate
      clear initial concepts. The booklet next presents a short account of the
      life of the Báb as the Herald of the New Age Who sacrificed His Own life
      to usher humanity into the Kingdom of God on earth. It goes on to explain
      the station of ‘Abdu’1-Bahá as the Interpreter, the Exemplar, and the
      Center of Bahá’u’lláh’s Covenant. In doing so, it emphasizes fundamental
      concepts such as the protection against strife and division conferred on
      the Faith through the power of the Covenant, and the unique bounty
      bestowed on the followers of Bahá’u’lláh in the example of 4Abdu’1-Bahá as
      the embodiment of His Father’s teachings. The presentation then turns to a
      brief description of several laws and ordinances, such as the education of
      children, the requirement of daily prayer, the prohibition of alcoholic
      drinks, and the injunction against backbiting and slander. Finally, the
      existence of an administrative order is mentioned, and some of the
      characteristics of a Local Spiritual Assembly are described in a very
      general way. Each page of the booklet includes a quotation from the
      Writings which the teacher is urged to recite after explaining the related
      ideas. Teachers are also encouraged to invite questions and comments from
      the seekers throughout their presentation and, at the end, to invite them
      to join the Faith, by asking them to meditate in their hearts on whether
      they accept Bahá’u’lláh as the Manifestation of God for today.",

      "Having witnessed a new level of consensus emerge among its small band of
      teachers, who now numbered about 30, the National Spiritual Assembly of
      Colombia adopted a new plan for teaching in villages and in neighborhoods
      of the cities to which, for several decades, rural people had been
      migrating in large numbers. The intensive consultation and preparation
      that had occupied the friends for a few months had produced miraculous
      effects on the Colombian believers. In a relatively short span of time
      they had achieved unity of thought, not only on the principles that would
      guide their teaching efforts but also on many fundamental issues related
      to the practical path they had traced for themselves. Invigorated by their
      new understanding and vision, they arose in support of the new plan of the
      National Spiritual Assembly and became vigorously engaged in teaching
      among the masses. Enthusiasm and an indescribable spirit of joy pervaded
      the community. Two members of the National Assembly offered to dedicate
      full-time service to teaching, and small teams, consisting mostly of
      youth, were formed around them. The work of these teams was strongly
      reinforced on weekends, when the friends would joyfully devote long hours
      to offer the healing Message of Bahá’u’lláh in one village after another.
      The results were spectacular: in less than two years the number of Bahá’ís
      in the country rose to about 10,000.",
    ],
    [
      "With the new emphasis on the quality of teaching, the believers found a
      great deal of satisfaction in their renewed activities. The message being
      offered was clear, and people were entering the Faith with much more
      understanding than in the previous stage of teaching. It was extremely
      gratifying to discover that more complete presentations of the Faith were
      leading to even higher rates of acceptance. Everyone was convinced that
      the masses were truly responding to Bahá’u’lláh, and were not only
      attracted by a few notions about unity and the abolition of prejudices.
      Also, the new method of teaching helped increasing numbers of new
      believers who were willing to arise and teach others. Teachers were asked
      to give special attention to new believers who showed great interest and
      capacity. Such believers were invited to weekend courses and encouraged to
      take part in teaching campaigns. Thus, over a two-year period, about two
      hundred people took part in teaching activities at one time or another.",
    ],
    [
      "Yet, the number who could be relied upon to teach consistently grew very
      slowly. Many potential teachers participated in only a few events before
      gradually drifting away, often because of the pressure of expectations
      they sensed from the other Bahá’ís that they should assume a great deal of
      responsibility as soon as they had participated in a few teaching events.
      Money was also a great test. Believers with little deepening were
      entrusted with sums of money which, although small, represented great
      temptations to them. When these new believers misused funds, the
      administrative institutions and coordinators of teaching campaigns would
      lose all confidence in them. At the time, strong emphasis was being placed
      on the notion that Bahá’ís should not judge one another, and that every
      believer was reborn the moment he or she accepted the Bahá’í Message. The
      extreme application of these ideas led some of the friends, who were
      overly concerned with the increase of numbers, to promote as teachers
      individuals who were motivated by desire for personal gain. In one region,
      a group of about twenty teachers turned out to have deceived the pioneer.
      When this was discovered, a group of trusted teachers had to be sent to
      re-introduce the Faith to about one thousand souls, so that statistics
      already shared with the friends would not have to be revised. The personal
      differences which sometimes arose among new believers who joined teaching
      campaigns constituted another constant source of difficulty. Despite
      peace-making efforts by more experienced teachers on the teams, it was
      often impossible to avoid clashes which, unfortunately, affected many so
      strongly that they dropped out of teaching activities altogether.",

      "Apart from problems with individuals, a more far-reaching aspect of the
      growth of the Cause in this period gradually became a concern of the
      institutions and indeed was soon recognized as the kernel of a new crisis.
      Although, as individuals, new believers were attaining deep understanding
      of the Faith, communities were not responding in the same way. Hardly any
      Bahá’í community life was developing in the villages. Local Spiritual
      Assemblies were elected with enthusiasm, but would meet only once or twice
      before the initial interest completely disappeared. Despite a constant
      flow of new believers, the community was not growing according to the
      pattern the friends had envisioned. It was realized that once again, the
      community needed to engage in an intensive process of consultation and
      reexamine some of the assumptions underlying the choice of methods and
      procedures.",

      "A series of meetings of consultation shed new light on the challenges of
      developing communities and increasing the number of teachers, and helped
      the community move forward again. The facts seemed to indicate that too
      much emphasis had been placed on first impressions of individuals and,
      indeed, that in the desire to refrain from judging, a great many
      judgements had been made. It began to seem unreasonable that the
      institutions of the Faith should close their eyes to the frailties of
      human nature; surely, they should exercise caution when assigning
      responsibility to people who had not yet had an opportunity to draw upon
      the power of the Faith to bring about significant change in their inner
      lives. The mood of the National Spiritual Assembly swung away from an
      emphasis on individuals. The approach adopted for the next phase of the
      expansion-consolidation process centered mostly on community education. It
      was decided that no special efforts would be made to open new communities,
      but a relatively small number of villages and towns would be visited time
      and again. The majority of the families in each of these villages would be
      systematically deepened, and a sequence of Bahá’í concepts would be
      explained to every household during repeated visits. New believers would
      be invited to teach, but mostly in their own villages. The more
      experienced teachers would take it upon themselves to act with such purity
      and to teach in conditions of such sacrifice that the hearts of the people
      would be transformed through the power of their example. Within this
      atmosphere of self-sacrifice and detachment, sincere new teachers would
      surely arise spontaneously, and the mistakes of the past would be
      avoided.",

      increased to about 30,000 within a few years. The number of teachers who
      participated in campaigns hovered around 50, but their quality and
      dedication more than compensated for the fewness of their numbers. The
      30,000 Bahá’ís were clustered in about 200 large Bahá’í communities, so
      that the deepening of new believers became more manageable. Groups of
      teachers would stay in a village for days and even weeks, holding meetings
      with the families, the Bahá’í community, and especially the members of the
      Local Spiritual Assembly. The most enthusiastic new believers were the
      children and youth 12 to 15 years of age, and they received a great deal
      of special attention. Efforts were made to develop teaching materials and
      audio-visual aids for the teachers to use. A small print shop was
      acquired. Thousands of copies of single sheets and booklets for children
      and adults were produced and shared with the constant stream of new
      believers. So intense was the enthusiasm of the teachers, so joyful the
      deepening meetings in the newly formed communities, so successful the
      regional weekend institutes, and so high the rate of acceptance that, for
      a few months, the community seemed to be achieving its dream of a
      self-sustaining process of expansion and consolidation.",

      100,000 Bahá’ís in a few more years began to seem less and less

      The physical health of the few workers was rapidly deteriorating,
      financial resources were not increasing, and the constant pressure of
      maintaining high-quality activity, campaign alter campaign, became
      progressively harder to bear. So few were the workers that a crisis in the

      in a more profound understanding of what it means to rely on the power of
      divine assistance. Even today, in moments of fond reminiscence, those

      villagers who have carried the burdens of an unjust society on their
      shoulders for so many decades? Do we even know how they perceive their own

      "It was clearly time to slow down what had become a very high-powered
      approach to “giving the Message” and begin to listen. As the teachers did
      listen more carefully to the new believers and learned to observe the
      communities with a degree of detachment from their own plans and projects,
      it became clear that the villagers’ impressions of them were very much at
      variance with the images they had intended to project. The new believers
      viewed them as a group of highly dedicated people they had grown to love
      and respect as their teachers, but not as people with whom they could
      easily walk on a common path: These newly acquired friends visited them
      regularly and explained the verities of the new religion they had
      accepted. Some of these friends were more constant than others. Some came
      quietly to visit families at their homes; others were dynamic and would
      infuse large meetings with joy and spirit. At the Bahá’í meetings in the
      village one always heard inspiring talks, sang joyous songs and felt
      uplifted by beautiful prayers. On occasion, special courses would be
      offered in nearby towns which, unfortunately, one’s busy life did not
      often allow one to attend. But whenever the opportunity presented itself,
      one could certainly receive valuable instruction by attending these
      special courses. It was also possible for some of the youth of the village
      to accompany the teachers in visits and campaigns, but they could not stay
      away from home for too long, for the subsistence of a family depends on
      contributions from every member. Of course, an important distinction of
      this new religion was that it had no clergy and everyone was urged to
      participate in running its affairs. That is why, every year, a Local
      Spiritual Assembly was elected in every village. The emphasis that was put
      on the Local Assembly showed how important this institution would become
      in the future. One was constantly reminded that the Assembly would
      eventually be responsible for the progress of the entire village, even if
      now it was only in its beginning stages. To vote for the Assembly was not
      difficult. To be a member of it made one feel the weight of certain
      responsibilities. But what did it really mean to be responsible for the
      progress of the community, much less the entire village? To convince the
      Bahá’ís to attend meetings was difficult enough, and the effort succeeded
      only when one of the experienced people from outside was present. But to
      run the affairs of the village was another matter; it was a wonderful
      ideal that some day would surely be addressed.",

      perceived service to the Faith, but the analysis that it reflects helped
      the Colombian friends gain insights into the approach and methods they had
      been using. At stake here was the fundamental question of how to help
      others tread the path from acceptance to service. Acceptance, for people
      whose hearts had been prepared by suffering, was apparently an easy
      matter. That Bahá’u’lláh had come to lead us into a new civilization was
      easily understood by the villagers when they examined His teachings in the
      context of their own lives and in light of a common wisdom that had been
      handed down through the generations. Love for Bahá’u’lláh came easily to
      them as they listened to the stories of His life and His sufferings, and
      contemplated the signs of His inevitable victory. Confirmation in the new
      Faith, although slow and gradual, was proving possible for them, through
      visits, courses, and conferences. Even a certain level of consciousness
      that it is necessary to obey the laws of Bahá’u’lláh was becoming
      widespread. But effective participation in the service of the Cause seemed
      to require a different dynamic of teaching that somehow had not been
      generated by the approaches and methods known at that time to the
      Colombian friends.",

      question their approaches to teaching at a most fundamental level. At that
      early stage, however, they were unaware of the magnitude of change that
      this line of questioning would require of them. In fact, in their haste to
      achieve victories, they clarified only one idea from among the many topics
      that needed consultation, used it to make a slight modification to their
      plans, and returned quickly to the field of action.",

      friends reviewed the evolution of their plans and concepts they realized
      how, at an earlier stage, they had been deeply affected by their errors of
      judgement in selecting and promoting individuals without due discretion.
      In reaction, they had then concentrated on the development of their own
      spiritual qualities, hoping that the example of their sacrifice and
      selfless service would suffice to inspire others to arise and teach the
      Faith. But somehow, in this process, many of them had assumed the posture
      of instructors, and they had neglected to help the new believers to
      discover their own capacities for action. The problem was not, of course,
      that they had failed to mention the importance of participation while
      issuing appeals and giving instructions. It was simply that the new
      believers needed to be shown a path of service which, if followed, would
      gradually make them independent of outside visitors.",

      knowledge about the precepts of the Faith, its history, its aims, and its
      Administrative Order. Villagers were quite inspired when they were
      presented with the vision of a future Bahá’í society and its harmonious
      and well-organized local communities. They were convinced of the necessity
      for strong Bahá’í families. They aspired to attain the station and the
      qualities of a true servant described by their teachers. But how were they
      actually to achieve their aspirations for themselves, their families and
      their communities? Emotionally charged calls to action and the
      affirmations that no matter how little we knew, we would be confirmed if
      we only would arise to serve the Faith, were uplifting and reassuring;
      yet, most individuals needed to build up confidence and to develop
      gradually their capacity to serve the Faith, starting with simple,
      practical acts, and progressing to more complex and demanding forms of
      involvement in the work of the Faith. Effective deepening, then, in
      addition to imparting knowledge and uplifting the spirit, had to offer
      people the possibility of following a concrete path of service.",

    [
      "There is no doubt that this line of reasoning was pointing to very
      exciting possibilities for the Colombian Bahá’í community. But at the
      time, the friends were trying to remedy, as quickly as possible, the
      shortcomings they had discovered in their latest approach to teaching. The
      answer that came most easily was that large numbers of believers might be
      helped to embark on their paths of service by repeating the simplest act
      that the more experienced teachers were already performing in their visits
      to the communities. The National Teaching Committee had been developing a
      set of small booklets, each devoted to a single topic such as the
      Covenant, the life of Bahá’u’lláh, love and unity among the friends, or
      the Nineteen Day Feast. These booklets were being shared with individuals
      and families when they were visited in their homes, and the results had
      been encouraging. It was already known that the new friends were hesitant
      to share these booklets with others, basically because they were afraid of
      being asked questions that they would be unable to answer. The modified
      plan of action, then, called for the preparation of material that would
      treat each topic more extensively, to be studied with those who showed a
      willingness to share the small booklets with their relatives and friends.
      With a new wave of enthusiasm, the teachers resumed their visits to the
      villages, confident that in addition to fostering general community
      education, they would now be helping some of the friends to begin a path
      of service. But, alas, although they continued to have success in
      deepening believers with the booklets, the study of additional materials
      with the more interested ones added very few to the total number of
      dedicated teachers in the country and proved to be an inadequate response
      to the much weightier challenge of fostering the spirit of service among a
      significant number of new believers.",

      of service. Experience confirmed the previous conclusion, that mere
      acceptance of the basic verities of the Faith would not move the body of
      the friends to serve the Cause unless they were offered a practical path
      they could gradually follow as their capacities expanded. Now it was also
      becoming clear that these friends would not necessarily sustain their
      services simply because they received some training to carry out a few
      acts of service. If service was to be sustained beyond initial expressions
      of enthusiasm and excitement, it had to become possible for the believers
      to participate in a continuous process of spiritual enrichment. With the
      exception of a few believers who quickly learned to derive spiritual
      sustenance from their own personal study of the Writings, everyone needed
      systematic programs, organized by the institutions, to help them tread at
      least the beginnings of their newly adopted paths of spiritual progress.
      Such systematic programs, however, had to go beyond the exposition of
      facts or simple training in practical matters; they had to help the
      participants walk paths of service that were informed by spiritual
      insights and derived meaning from ever-deeper spiritual understanding.",

      and aspire to education. However, it was recognized from the beginning
      that the effort would fail if the many distortions created by formal
      educational systems could not be avoided. Service to the Cause was a right
      and a responsibility of every believer, no matter how new to the Faith;
      their exercise of this right could not be conditioned on the completion of
      a set of educational courses that could be interpreted as prerequisites
      for service. The challenge was to set in motion an educational process
      that would increase the believer’s capacity to serve, without creating
      barriers to spiritual growth or introducing rigidity into the teaching
      plans of the institutions of the Faith. As the Colombian community set out
      to meet this challenge, a systematic approach to deepening was gradually
      developed and organized under what later came to be known as the Ruhi

      A few of these ideas are closely linked to the evolution of the concept of
      large-scale teaching described in the previous sections. They may be
      expressed in the following sequence of statements:",
    ],
    [
      "1) Large-scale expansion and consolidation can be effectively viewed as
      the movement of receptive populations towards the future World Order of
      Bahá’u’lláh. This movement is eminently spiritual. It occurs fundamentally
      in the hearts and minds of individuals, but gradually manifests itself in
      the entire social, economic, and cultural structure of the population and
      in the transformation of the relationships between the individual and
      society. Teaching is the spiritual process by which this movement is
      constantly propelled.",
    ],
    [
      "2) It is natural to expect that individuals within the population will
      not tread their spiritual paths at the same pace. At any given moment the
      population will present a continuum of responses, from the indifference of
      those who are barely aware of the existence of the Cause, to the intense
      devotion of those who have dedicated their lives to its promotion. The
      classification of Bahá’ís in mutually exclusive categories ~ active and
      inactive, deepened and undeepened, spiritualized and unspiritualized — has
      little place in an approach that is concerned with the dynamics of the
      spiritual movement of a people. Even undue emphasis on a Bahá’í/non-Bahá’í
      duality proves to be harmful in that it creates unnecessary barriers to
      the progress of individual souls and blurs the vision of a spiritual
      movement.",
    ],
    [
      "3) In order for a population to move towards a Bahá’í civilization,
      forces of transformation from within the population, which arc directly
      generated by the power of the Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh, must be allowed
      to grow in strength and range of influence. Such a process of
      transformation is impeded if the initiators of large-scale expansion,
      often regular visitors from nearby regions or pioneers, cling to their
      identity as outsiders, perpetuating thereby a “we/they” duality that, in
      turn, leads to a condition of dependence, to frustration, or even to
      bitterness. Teachers, whatever their background, must develop a sense of
      belonging to the people they try to serve and learn to view their own
      spiritual progress as one component of the spiritual movement of the
      entire population. The spiritual transformation of a people is an organic
      process that must be propelled from within. In this Revelation, it is
      guided by the institutions of the Faith which, after all, belong to
      experienced and new Bahá’ís alike; but it cannot be managed from outside,
      no matter how well-intentioned the outsiders may be.",
    ],
    [
      "4) The spiritual dynamics of teaching is essentially the same for the
      poor and the rich, the villagers and the urban dwellers, the educated and
      the illiterate. All new believers must have the benefit of a nurturing
      process that allows them to become confirmed in the Faith as they
      gradually dedicate more time and resources to its service. When the
      numbers are small, close friends often accompany new believers through joy
      and sorrow, tests and triumphs, until confidence is built and a sense of
      responsibility is firmly established. When many people rapidly accept the
      Faith in the process of large-scale expansion it cannot be assumed that
      their need for this nurturing is any less real. The problem, of course, is
      that as the numbers increase rapidly it becomes impossible for a few to
      establish intimate bonds of friendship with the majority of the new
      believers. Deepening, especially for populations that have little
      tradition of reading books, becomes a difficulty that, unless surmounted,
      tends to slow the movement of the population and bring to a sudden halt
      the process of expansion. The use of modern communications media can be of
      some help, but they are no substitute for personal support and the
      transmission of spiritual insights and energy from one heart to another
      when they are connected by bonds of love.",
    ],
    [
      "5) The recognition that the spiritual movement of a population
      necessarily comprises the movements of individuals, each at a unique pace;
      an appreciation of the essential role played by forces generated from
      within the population in propelling its spiritual movement; attention to
      the universal need for participation in a consistent, progressive process
      of spiritual education; and the acknowledgement that a few, by themselves,
      cannot respond to the deepening needs of large numbers of believers, all
      point to the necessity of a systematic process of human resource
      development that concentrates on those who show more interest, are more
      capable, and have a greater desire to render service. Human resource
      development in this context, however, embodies two principles that
      distinguish it from prevalent models of formal education. The pace at
      which believers move along their paths of spiritual development is not
      predetermined, but varies according to individual desires and aspirations
      in an open learning process. And, the nature of the educational process is
      such that those who receive attention also nurture others. This approach
      to the development of human resources, then, differs from traditional
      schemes of schooling which, in a paradoxical way, efface individuality
      while rewarding and cultivating selfishness. Human resource development is
      understood as that process which catalyzes the emergence of workers for
      the Cause who are entirely dedicated to the service of others and
      committed to the spiritual movement of their people.",
    ],
    [
      "Initially, the Colombian believers conceived the Ruhi Institute as an
      institution for the development of human resources among a population of
      about 100,000 villagers in the region of Norte del Cauca, near the city of
      Cali. Soon the institute expanded its vision to embrace similar
      populations everywhere in Colombia, especially in the rural areas.
      Although a modest building was constructed in the town of Puerto Tejada,
      the connection between the institute and the building became rather
      tenuous, as most of the courses were moved to villages and towns all over
      the country. That the National Spiritual Assembly of Colombia had decided
      to create an entity primarily concerned with the development of human
      resources, and to give it a structure and importance parallel to that of
      its National Teaching Committee, was a significant step. The initial
      implementation of the decision was not limited to the mere creation of a
      committee which would be left to itself to respond to the demands of a
      well-written mandate. The order of priorities was reflected in the
      national budget, which was divided approximately as follows: 30% for
      teaching, 30% for human resource development, 20% for literature and
      audio-visual materials, and only 20% for administrative and support
      expenses. It was also reflected in the pattern of activity of the more
      experienced Bahá’ís of the country, including the members of the National
      Assembly and its committees, who devoted their energies more or less
      according to the same proportions.",

      "Any retrospective account of a long-term developmental process, such as
      the present document, is likely to project a false impression of order.
      The Colombian friends did not work out their ideas about spiritual
      education as neatly and clearly as may be implied in the previous section.
      For that matter, the evolution of their thought never proceeded according
      to the linear progression this document seems to reflect. Ideas developed
      independently along parallel lines and only later came together in a
      consistent framework. Clarity and confusion coexisted from the beginning,
      and continue to interplay as the community confronts new challenges under
      changing conditions. It would be well, then, to depart momentarily from
      the narrative, and examine certain aspects of the educational programs in
      their more recent stages of development.",

      spiritual growth of the individual, it is recognized that an individual’s
      spiritual condition and his progress are matters that only God can judge
      and that human beings should not presume to measure. The Ruhi Institute,
      therefore, has adopted a pedagogical approach that concerns itself
      exclusively with ways in which individuals can be helped to increase their
      capacity to serve. This capacity, while intimately connected with
      spirituality, operates in relation to it in ways that need not be defined
      precisely. It suffices to understand that the field of service represents
      the environment within which spirituality can be cultivated.",

      believers are accompanied along paths of service which they have chosen to
      follow, according to their interests and capabilities. Building on
      experience gained in working among rural populations in Colombia, the Ruhi
      Institute has marked out specific “paths of service.” Deepening along each
      path is fostered through a series of courses, some of which impart the
      skills and attitudes needed to perform acts of service, while others
      present spiritual teachings and precepts that endow these acts with
      meaning.",

      "During the first few years of its development, the Ruhi Institute devoted
      its attention entirely to defining the content and methods of the courses
      associated with the path of “Basic Deepening”. After a great deal of
      experimentation it was decided that the first act of service on this path
      should be that of teaching simple Bahá’í classes to a group of children.
      In addition to a course that offers the content of such classes and
      imparts the necessary skills to conduct them, it proved necessary to
      devise four other courses devoted entirely to the development of spiritual
      understanding and the acquisition of spiritual discipline. The
      participants in these five courses are usually youth from the villages who
      have completed at least a few years of secondary school and have expressed
      interest in teaching children on a weekly basis. The following five
      sections are devoted to an overview of these courses.",

  [
    section: 'Understanding the Bahá\'í Writings',
    [
      "The first course in the path of Basic Deepening requires only about eight
      hours of study and discussion. Its purpose is to develop the capacity to
      read the Bahá’í Writings and to meditate on their meaning in order to
      fulfill the obligation of studying the Writings every day. As one of the
      activities in the children’s classes is the memorization of short
      quotations from the Bahá’í Writings, it is felt that the teachers of these
      classes should, themselves, have learned to study the Writings, beginning
      with single sentences, and meditate on their meanings. The course consists
      of some twenty quotations that are studied in small groups and a set of
      questions and exercises that enhance the participants’ ability to think
      about the meaning and implications of each quotation. The following
      paragraphs are taken from the introductory material for this course, which
      is called “Understanding the Bahá’í Writings”:",

      study, teach, or apply its courses, wherever they may reside. These
      participants are indeed collaborators, because all share an identical
      purpose: to use the courses as means of serving the Cause and promoting
      the well-being of humanity. In every study group there is always a more
      experienced person who acts as a tutor. For the duration of the course,
      the other members of the group constitute the “students” who seek the
      tutor’s help with their studies. However, it is clearly understood by all
      collaborators that they are engaged in a reciprocal process, one in which
      everyone learns. The relationship is not that of a learned one with a
      group of ignorant people.",
    ],
    [
      "”Understanding the Bahá’í Writings” is often the first course that a
      group of collaborators chooses to study. We hope the tutor will carefully
      study this introduction and discuss with the other collaborators the ideas
      presented here. Collaborators who arc studying this course for the first
      time should be aware that they will have to analyze these same ideas at a
      later time, when they themselves will act as tutors of the course for
      other groups of beginners.",
    ],
    [
      "To read the Holy Writings every day, at least in the morning and at
      night, is one of the very important ordinances of our Faith. But reading
      the Writings is not the same as reading the thousands of pages that a
      literate person sees during a lifetime. To read the Sacred Word is to
      drink from the ocean of Divine Revelation. It leads to true spiritual
      understanding and generates forces that are necessary for the progress of
      the soul. In order to reach true understanding, however, one must think
      deeply about the meaning of each statement and its applications in one’s
      own life and in the life of society. The purpose of this course is to
      develop in the participants the habit of reading the Writings and thinking
      about them, beginning at first with one-sentence statements.",
    ],
    [
      "In studying any course of the Ruhi Institute, participants are expected
      to achieve three levels of comprehension. The first is a basic
      understanding of the meaning of words and sentences. Thus, for example,
      after reading the quotation, “The betterment of the world can be
      accomplished through pure and goodly deeds, through commendable and seemly
      conduct”, the student is asked, “How can the betterment of the world be
      accomplished?” At first glance, this type of question may appear too
      simple. But, before reaching such a conclusion, one should examine the
      following two observations: Often, the tutor will divide the study group
      into pairs; one person in each pair is asked to read the quotation aloud,
      and the other is asked to formulate a question, the answer of which would
      be the quotation. This task of constructing a question from a sentence
      does not turn out to be as simple as it appears. The majority of
      participants need numerous exercises in order to acquire this apparently
      simple skill. The second observation has to do with the participants who
      insist on giving their own opinions and strongly resist giving a simple
      repetition of the quotation as the answer to a question. Clearly, there is
      nothing wrong in having and expressing one’s own ideas; but an
      understanding of the Writings must begin by focusing the mind on what is
      being read before allowing one’s imagination to roam and personal opinions
      to flow freely. It is quite likely that by first developing in believers
      who are in the early stages of their study of the Faith a capacity to
      focus attention on the immediate and explicit meaning of sentences they
      read from the Holy Writings, we will be contributing to the achievement
      oí’ unity of thought in our communities, since such a unity can only be
      achieved when personal opinions are illuminated by Divine Wisdom.",
    ],
    [
      "The second level of comprehension is concerned with applying some of the
      concepts to one’s daily life. For example, exercise number 1 in the first
      lesson, which asks the participant to identify certain types of conduct as
      commendable, is easy to answer, yet it requires the group to think about
      some of the obvious applications of the corresponding quotation. However,
      not all the exercises of this level can receive immediate and obvious
      answers. For example, in order to decide if the statement, “There are so
      few good people in the world that their actions do not have any effect” is
      true or false, the students have to establish how this statement
      contradicts the corresponding quotations they have studied from the
      Writings of Bahá’u’lláh.",
    ],
    [
      "The third level of understanding requires the participants to think about
      the implications of a quotation for situations having no apparent or
      immediate connection with its theme. The question of whether Bahá’ís may
      confess their sins to others refers to the prohibition against confession
      as a means of absolving sin, a deeply rooted practice of Catholicism. The
      tutor should present this prohibition as the group consults on the
      implications of the verse, “Bring thyself to account each day, ere thou
      art summoned to a reckoning.”",
    ],
    [
      "Many years of experience with the courses of the Ruhi Institute have
      shown that examining ideas at these three levels of understanding helps
      collaborators create the conscious basis of a life of service to the
      Cause. But what may surprise someone who is unfamiliar with this
      experience is that efforts to prolong consultation on each idea beyond
      these levels, by introducing too many related concepts, actually diminish
      to a great extent the effectiveness of the course. This is due in part to
      the fact that each course should establish a rhythm of progress, so that
      students will have a distinct sense that they are advancing rapidly
      according to their own capacities. This does not mean that lessons should
      be passed over quickly and superficially without careful analysis of the
      exercises. Groups that have taken this superficial approach, simply
      filling in answers, have never lasted beyond a few sessions. The point to
      remember is that once an idea is understood and some insights into its
      applications have been gained, the group should advance to the next point
      in the lesson. The second reason for the caution against prolonged
      discussions has to do with the habit of speculation that unfortunately
      sometimes develops in some of our communities. It is natural that a verse
      from the Writings should bring to mind myriads of noble and beautiful
      ideas. To share these ideas with the friends on appropriate occasions
      conduces to joy and happiness. But care must be exercised that this
      practice does not become an exercise in the expression of ego and an
      insistence on the sovereignty of personal opinion. The experience of the
      Ruhi Institute has shown that we do not suppress the imagination or the
      personality of the participants when we refrain from posing questions such
      as, “What does this mean to you?” On the contrary, we are helping to
      nurture the development of communities which look first to the Writings as
      the principal basis of consultation whenever they are faced with a
      question. We believe that the simple habit of thinking about the
      implications of the Writings with the minimum of personal interpretation
      would eliminate a great share of the disagreements that afflict
      consultation in many communities, and would make the activities of our
      communities more effective.",
    ],
    [
      "Finally, we suggest that the tutor should examine the course, categorize
      the exercises according to the three levels of comprehension, and think of
      additional exercises that will stimulate consultation about each concept."

    section: Prayer,
    [
      "The second course in the path of Basic Deepening also requires about
      eight hours of study and discussion. Its purpose is to help the
      participants understand the importance of daily prayer, develop the
      required attitudes towards prayer, and acquire the habit of memorizing
      prayers. The course on prayer contributes to the spiritual development of
      the participants, and also prepares them for their first act of service,
      which includes helping the children to memorize prayers. As in
      “Understanding the Bahá’í Writings”, the course material is comprised

      understanding. The following paragraphs are from the introduction to the
      course entitled “Prayer”:",

      experience than others is assigned to serve as the tutor of the study
      group, although it must be remembered that the responsibility for learning
      rests with each participant. It is the student who undertakes the active
      work of learning. The tutor facilitates this process, and also gains new
      insights into the material. The teacher-student relationship that exists
      in many traditional school systems is avoided in the approach of the Ruhi
      Institute.",

      the institute. The tutor should keep in mind the three levels of
      comprehension that participants are expected to achieve: a clear
      understanding of the meaning of words and phrases, of the application of
      each idea to daily life, and of the implications these ideas have for
      related situations that have not been explicitly treated in the lessons.
      It is important to note here that the first level of comprehension never
      implies a long discussion on the meaning of single words outside the
      context of the course being studied. In fact, most tutors find that using
      a dictionary to help the participants understand difficult words actually
      interferes with their learning. It seems far more useful to help them
      learn how to infer the meanings of words through discussion of whole
      phrases and paragraphs.",
    ],
    [
      "We suggest that in preparing for this course the tutor should think
      deeply about three principal objectives. The first is to clarify the
      concept of prayer itself and to help the participants understand its great
      importance as one of the laws of this Dispensation. In order to achieve
      this objective, it is sometimes necessary to dissipate doubts and
      carefully clarify ideas that may have their roots in erroneous
      interpretations of the past. But above all, this objective implies clear
      understanding of the necessity to observe this law, a need that is no less
      essential than that of nourishing our bodies every day.",
    ],
    [
      "Beyond observing the law of prayer, each person must feel a profound
      desire to pray. Therefore, the second objective of this course is to
      awaken in participants this desire to “converse with God” and to feel the
      joy of being near to Him. Moreover, from an early age, everyone should
      develop spiritual habits; the habit of praying daily is among the most
      important of these.",
    ],
    [
      "The third objective of this course has to do with the attitudes of
      prayer. Unfortunately, humanity is steadily losing its understanding of
      how to pray, substituting empty and meaningless rituals for indispensable
      inner conditions. Therefore, the study groups should consult a great deal
      on the sections that refer to the attitudes of heart and mind that help
      one enter the state of prayer, and to the conditions that should be
      created in one’s surroundings at the time of prayer.",
    ],
    [
      "Finally, we suggest that before the first class the tutor should review
      the entire course, analyzing each lesson in terms of the three objectives
      mentioned above.",

  [
    section: 'Life and Death',
    [
      "The course entitled “Life and Death” has been included in the path of
      Basic Deepening because an understanding of the purpose of life is
      essential for the participants’ pursuit of paths of service. Service needs
      to be viewed in the full context of a life which extends beyond earthly
      existence, and in light of the soul’s progress through the worlds of God.
      The purpose of this course, then, is to help participants understand that
      life is not the changes and chances of this world, and that its true
      significance is to be found in the development of the soul. The material
      for “Life and Death” is somewhat more challenging than for the courses
      mentioned above, and its completion usually requires about twenty hours of
      study and consultation. The following paragraphs come from the course
      introduction:",

      being. - Death is just a change of condition; afterward, the soul
      progresses eternally.",

      attain His presence. - One who recognizes the Manifestation draws near to
      God; and one who rejects Him condemns himself to a life of misery and
      remoteness from God. - Just as, while in the womb of the mother one
      acquires the powers needed for this world, while in this world we should
      acquire the powers needed for the next world.",

      "3. The nature of the soul. - The soul is a sign of God. - A soul which is
      faithful to God will reflect His light and be drawn to Him. - Worldly
      attachments and vain desires impede the soul’s flight towards God and
      finally make it weak and impotent. - God has bestowed on man the capacity
      to reflect all His names and attributes.",

      "4. The soul docs not progress by itself; it needs the Manifestation of
      God. - The capacities of the human being are latent; they can only be
      developed with the help of the Manifestations of God. - To know the
      Manifestation of God is to know God. - Through spiritual education, the
      treasures hidden within us can be revealed.",

    [
      "5. The condition of the soul after death. - The faithful soul will attain
      a sublime position and eternal happiness, but the unfaithful soul will
      recognize its loss and be consumed in eternal remorse. - No one knows his
      own end; therefore, we should forgive others and not feel superior towards
      them. - In the next life, the holy souls become acquainted with all
      mysteries and behold the beauty of God. - In the next life, we will
      recognize our loved ones and enjoy companionship with the friends of God;
      we will remember the life we had in this material world.",

      develop the ability to carry out the first act of service, that of
      teaching classes, under very simple conditions, to a small group of
      children. The participants learn how to teach a prepared set of lessons

      Each lesson consists of a quotation from the Bahá’í Writings, a song, a
      story, a game, and a picture to be colored. All of these elements are
      related to a spiritual quality which is the theme of the lesson. In

      areas and neighborhoods on the outskirts of towns and cities, and their
      insistent desire for Bahá’í teachers to educate their children, are well
      known. The problem is that there have never been enough teachers to
      respond to this well-justified demand; and unfortunately, for some reason
      or other, many capable Bahá’ís who could teach children have not attached
      enough importance to this act of service on which the future of new
      generations depends.",

      the classes of indoctrination which are common in many other religions.
      Even though children are instructed in the principles, teachings and basic
      beliefs of the Faith, the emphasis is on learning to think, to reflect and
      to apply spiritual laws to the life of the individual and society.

      religious education for children and have left them to acquire their
      standards and beliefs, supposedly by free choice, from their interactions
      with society, have greatly contributed to the present state of moral
      disintegration. The proponents of these doctrines do not seem to
      appreciate the fact that there are political, economic and cultural
      interests in society which aggressively promote their own desired patterns
      of thought and behavior. But even if this were not so, humanity left to
      its own devices without divine guidance has produced nothing more than

      "- The development of capacity for holding a simple children’s class, and
      the acquisition of the corresponding skills, require great deal of
      practice. It is to be expected, then, that this course will be long and
      sometimes even difficult. Teaching a lesson to children requires more than
      reading the material and understanding its content. The tutor should allow
      a great deal of time for the future teachers to practice giving the
      classes as they study the course.",
    ],
    [
      "- The majority of people who wish to teach children generally try to
      repeat the same patterns which they were exposed to in childhood. To
      counteract this normal tendency, this course offers detailed suggestions
      to which the tutor and the participants should pay close attention.",
    ],
    [
      "- It is hoped that children’s classes will provide a means for developing
      in the children attitudes and spiritual qualities that will bring them
      closer to God. In this first course, the emphasis is on spiritual
      qualities, and little attention is being given to general knowledge about
      the Faith. When the foundation of the child’s character has been
      established, then, in later years, other necessary types of knowledge can
      be introduced.",
    ],
    [
      "- The methodology of the children’s classes combines different
      activities, all focused on the principal goal of motivating the
      development of attitudes and spiritual qualities. All these activities
      revolve around the Creative Word, which alone has the power to awaken
      spiritual susceptibilities in the children, and a strong emphasis is
      placed on memorization of the Creative Word. Memorization has even greater
      effect when accompanied by an understanding of what is being memorized.
      For this reason, each lesson includes material to help children understand
      the meaning of the quotations and also learn to apply the corresponding
      attitudes and spiritual qualities in their daily lives. Unfortunately, at
      this stage, few songs and games have been developed, so it has not always
      been possible to design activities that directly reinforce the ideas
      presented in the quotations to be memorized. It is hoped that in the
      future many more songs and games will be created, and more stories on
      various spiritual qualities will be compiled, making the work of teach-ers
      of Bahá’í children’s classes even more fruitful.",
    ],
    [
      "- It is important to bear in mind that children understand things in very
      concrete and practical ways. A concept like kindness, for example, is
      better understood if presented by means of concrete situations, as well as
      through abstract explanations. The ability to do this is not easily
      fostered in the teacher. The participants of this course need to dedicate
      much time to practicing the explanations that accompany the quotations.
      Other activities in each lesson may also help to demonstrate spiritual
      qualities in action. The stories of ‘Abdu’1-Bahá are of greatest
      importance, because He is the Exemplar of the Bahá’í life. Some
      participants may have trouble learning how to tell stories in a way that
      brings them to life for the children. The ability to remember the details
      that give excitement to a story and to present the events of the story in
      an effective way can be acquired by means of constant practice.",
    ],
    [
      "- The type of children’s classes that are taught in this course require
      very little in the way of materials and outside resources. Besides the
      teacher’s knowledge, acquired through the training offered by the
      institute, only coloring sheets and crayons are needed. The coloring
      sheets can be simply reproduced by tracing them from the sample sheets
      provided for each lesson.",
    ],

      "- It is recommended that participants begin putting their new skills into
      practice as they go through the course. This will allow them to build up
      gradually to the time when they will take on their own classes. New
      teachers may feel nervous the first time they face a class of, say, 20
      children, so it is advisable to let them start out alongside experienced
      teachers or with a small number of children - perhaps four or five. It is
      also possible to hold classes which only teach the quotations at the
      beginning, without worrying about stories, songs and other activities. As
      the teacher develops confidence, more children can be added to the class
      and other elements can be introduced. It should be remembered that each
      participant’s final goal is to contribute to the success of the teaching
      plan of the national community, through the establishment of a regular
      children’s class.",

    section: 'Further Development of the Basic Deepening Path',
    [
      "During the early stages of the development of the Ruhi Institute, two
      more acts of service were identified which operate at a level of
      complexity similar to that of teaching simple children’s classes. The
      first was the sharing of a booklet, entitled “I am a Bahá’í”, with new
      believers. The other was the sharing of a series of deepening booklets
      with Bahá’í families over a period of a few months. The courses were
      developed to help participants acquire the necessary skills to carry out
      these acts of service and also gain more knowledge about the Faith. For a
      while, it was felt that the seven courses that have been mentioned up to
      this point could form the first level of the path of Basic Deepening;
      however, it soon became apparent that the first level lacked a Bahá’í
      history course, which is so much needed to develop the believers’ sense of
      identity as they begin to walk their paths of service. A detailed course
      on the life of the Báb was then added to the first level.",
    ],
    [
      "A second shortcoming became apparent when the results of the three acts
      of service were evaluated over a period of a few years. It was noticed
      that although some of the friends kept up regular family visits, others
      were not constant and soon lost enthusiasm. ‘The difference seemed to lie
      in their relative consciousness of the fact that the joy of teaching is in
      the act itself and not so much in the feeling of success or praise, or in
      the satisfaction that one seeks in superficial excitement. A ninth course
      was then developed, called “The Joy of Teaching”, which tries to convey
      this important concept through the study of appropriate quotations from
      the Writings. Together, these nine courses now comprise Level 1 of the
      path of Basic Deepening.",

      campaigns aimed at expansion and consolidation among entire, extended

      "Early in the 1980s, one of the Auxiliary Board members in Colombia
      entered into a process of consultation with several rural communities
      around the town of Puerto Tejada in order to help them identify steps they
      could take to improve their own social conditions. From the diverse ideas
      put forward in these meetings of consultation, one theme stood out: the
      desire of every community to establish kindergartens for the five- and
      six-year-old children, and nurseries for the younger ones. This was an
      understandable aspiration, as the Colombian government had succeeded in
      establishing primary schools in almost every village; but, at the time,
      the Ministry of Education was only beginning to consider the question of
      preschool education.",

      of the Bahá’í community at that time, led to a small pilot program to
      learn about small village kindergartens. Working in cooperation with the
      Ruhi Institute, the Auxiliary Board member who had initiated the
      consultations organized a group of young women selected from a few
      villages, helped them establish small kindergartens, visited their
      villages regularly, and offered them a weekly training course at the
      institute. Parallel to these efforts, a small group of believers who had
      backgrounds in the sciences and education began to analyze the ongoing
      experience and to develop a curriculum for the kindergartens.",
    ],
    [
      "For the first time, the Ruhi Institute was confronting the challenge of
      providing secular education in a Bahá’í setting. Initially, the friends
      explored the possibility of a curriculum that would consist of a few hours
      of moral education added to preschool materials which were easily
      available from internationally promoted programs. Soon, however, it was
      realized that an opportunity existed to create a curriculum in which the
      concepts of the Faith would pervade all the learning processes. They set
      out to develop materials and methods that would help the pupils acquire
      scientific, mathematical, and artistic abilities, as well as certain
      skills known to contribute to the ability to read and write, all in a
      spiritual context.",
    ],
    [
      "The pilot project went on for about four years. Each year the curriculum
      was revised and materials were rewritten on the basis of the previous
      year’s experience. By 1987, the program had advanced well enough to permit
      the institute to establish the first specialized path of service, that of
      “Education of Children”. The courses so far developed for this path are
      devoted to the training of teachers for Bahá’í village kindergartens.
      Further courses are envisioned for the training of educational agents for
      the primary level, but little work has yet been done in that direction.
      Unlike the courses of the Basic Deepening path, the initial training of
      kindergarten teachers, which lasts for eight weeks, is centralized in
      Puerto Tejada. Participants are mainly youth from villages throughout
      Colombia. It is assumed that, in their regions, they will already have
      studied the first five courses of the Basic Deepening path; those who have
      not, attend a two-week preparatory session before starting the
      kindergarten course. The training does not stop at the end of the
      eight-week term. Teachers who live near Puerto Tejada attend monthly

      developing local Bahá’í communities. The acts of service in the Basic
      Deepening and Education of Children paths certainly contribute to this
      objective; however, analysis of successful and failed efforts to develop
      local communities has led to the establishment of a separate path of
      service in “Community Development”. The courses of this path are directed

    [
      "For a long time, the Colombian friends understood community development
      exclusively in terms of the functioning of Local Spiritual Assemblies.
      When thoughts are entirely focused on the Local Assembly, it is natural
      that community workers will expend most of their energies on the adults,
      especially those who have been elected to Assemblies. In Colombia, it was
      often admitted that the most joyful and productive hours were those spent
      in the education of children and youth, particularly those between the
      ages of 12 and 16, but the implications of this fact were seldom discussed
      in the consultations on community development.",

      "As more experience was gained with community development, there was a
      growing sense that it was impractical to insist on a “functioning” Local
      Spiritual Assembly in places where one could hardly pretend that a Bahá’í
      community existed. The friends began to question the wisdom of making the
      functioning of the Local Assembly a pre-condition for every other
      development. They gradually came to accept that, in early stages, one may
      have to be content with a Local Assembly that is elected once a year and
      meets occasionally whenever a community worker from outside visits the
      village. To concentrate so much energy directly on the Local Assembly was
      clearly not the best way to develop that institution, and in fact, the
      Assembly could best be strengthened in the context of efforts to develop,
      in parallel fashion, a number of community structures and processes.",

    [
      "As logical as such an approach may seem, and although there was every
      evidence to support it, for most of the believers it was at first
      difficult to feel comfortable with these ideas, and something akin to a
      feeling of guilt assailed them for failing to give the Local Spiritual
      Assembly what they felt was its proper due in the order of priorities.
      Yet, as this approach began to be implemented and experience with it grew,
      its validity became more and more accepted. The courses on the path of
      service called “Community Development”, then, do not begin with the Local
      Assembly but with developing in community workers the capability to form
      and maintain youth groups in the villages.",
    ],
    [
      "The curriculum for this path of service has been developed in a similar
      fashion to that of Education of Children. Again in the early 1980s, an
      Auxiliary Board member was asked to experiment with the formation of
      village youth groups. His approach was to ask one of the older and more
      deepened youth in each village to organize a youth group which would not
      rely much on his own direct involvement As he observed the successes of
      these youth and the difficulties they faced, he formulated a conceptual
      framework which he shared with the Ruhi Institute. The institute was then
      asked to define specific acts of service and corresponding courses for the
      training of “Animators of Youth Groups” who would later progress to
      undertake other aspects of community development. As experience was
      gained, it became clear that to be an Animator of Youth Groups was a much
      more demanding task than originally envisioned. The participants in these
      courses needed to work under supervision and to receive help from
      experienced workers for a number of months before they could actually
      sustain the excitement of the youth and be able to deepen them in the
      Faith. For this reason, the first few courses of the Community Development
      path, which are concerned with youth groups, have been incorporated in the
      Year of Service program. Each year an increasing number of youth offer a
      year of service to the National Spiritual Assembly of Colombia, which
      assigns the majority of them to the Ruhi Institute. During this year they
      study levels 1 and 2 of the Basic Deepening path, the first few courses of
      the Community Development path, and the courses of the Education of
      Children path, up to the kindergarten teacher level. During the first
      weeks of the year of service, they receive most of their training at the
      Ruhi Institute in Puerto Tejada, but gradually spend more time in the
      villages to practice what they have learned, returning to the institute
      for regular meetings of consultation about their services.",

    [
      "1. Deepening programs may be founded on any of several concepts which
      offer equally valid approaches to the organization of knowledge and the
      development of curricula. These could include, for example, “the
      acquisition of knowledge for personal growth and transformation”, or “the
      development of individual potentials”, or “the preparation of individuals
      for appropriate functioning within the Bahá’í community”. From among
      various possibilities, the Ruhi Institute has chosen “service to the
      Cause” as the organizing principle of its educational activities. The
      programs of the institute do, of course, address the importance of
      knowledge, the development of human potential, the need for personal
      transformation, and the appropriate functioning of Bahá’í communities,
      just as Bahá’í courses founded on any of the other concepts named above
      would also address “service”. Nevertheless, the choice of an organizing
      principle is not a trivial one, for the resulting educational activities,
      the attitudes they foster towards learning, and indeed the sum of all that
      emerges from the educational process, will be strongly influenced by that
      choice.",
    ],
    [
      "A believer’s possibilities for service to the Cause of God are enhanced
      by the development of certain capabilities, such as the capability to
      teach on an individual basis, to participate in teaching campaigns
      organized by the community, to study the Writings in progressively more
      meaningful ways, to participate effectively in consultation, to help
      deepen new believers, and to educate children and help youth channel their
      energies. These are only a few from a wide range of capabilities that each
      Bahá’í may choose to acquire, in greater or lesser degrees, according to
      his or her interests and talents. A capability is not a simple skill; in
      fact, each of those mentioned above requires the acquisition of numerous
      skills and abilities. Moreover, the development of a given capability
      implies certain spiritual qualities, knowledge, proper attitudes, and an
      ever-deepening spiritual understanding of the Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh.
      Hence, the programs of the Ruhi Institute are not “training programs” in
      the sense that the term is generally used, namely to describe programs for
      the development of well-defined and discrete skills and the acquisition of
      specified information. Their purpose, rather, is the spiritual education
      of the friends, with service as the central and explicit concern of every
      educational activity. In the vocabulary of curriculum development, it can
      be said that service is the axis around which the diverse elements of the

      extracts from the Writings. For courses that are concerned with the
      acquisition of skills and abilities, proportionately more expository
      materials are included, but these materials are also presented in the
      explicit context of the Bahá’í teachings. Every effort is made to help the

      future when the results of efforts by large numbers of people to apply the
      Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh to educational practice, all over the world, can
      be integrated into a consistent body of knowledge. What the collaborators
      of the institute have tried to do is to ensure that at any given moment
      their educational practice reflects their best understanding of the
      guidance and inspiration enshrined in the Bahá’í Teachings.",
    ],
    [
      "The methodology for the elaboration of courses and educational materials
      has grown from the institute’s historical roots. In the early 1970s, as
      described above, a small group of people who were personally engaged in
      large-scale expansion and consolidation entered into a process of
      consultation about the successes and failures of their efforts. By
      reflecting on their own service and growth, they hoped to gain new
      insights into the dynamics of the spiritual movement of entire
      populations. As this nucleus of people began to advance in their own paths
      of service and to discover certain spiritual requirements of these paths,
      they became engaged in an educational process that would prepare an
      increasing number of individuals to similarly dedicate themselves to the
      spiritual movement of their own people. Naturally, the courses and
      educational materials took shape through the same process of
      consultation/action/reflection that had evolved as the group’s method of
      learning and service. Such an approach to curriculum development is
      clearly rooted in action. Curriculum is never seen as an instrument
      through which those who know will teach those who are ignorant, but as an
      instrument through which all participants can be empowered to serve,
      together, in a common learning process.",
    ],
    [
      "The approach to curriculum development can be summarized simply, in the
      following terms. Once an educational need is identified, a small group of
      people, working at the grass roots, consult among themselves, develop a
      set of ideas for educational activities, and put them into practice. The
      results of this practice are reviewed, evaluated and consulted upon; in
      light of this consultation, a modified set of educational activities is
      put into practice, and subjected to reflection that leads to further
      modification and revision. At no time in this process of curriculum
      development does action await the final preparation and evaluation of
      educational materials. At every stage, educational activities proceed with
      the best materials at hand, in the conviction that it is only through
      practice and reflection, both pursued in light of the Revelation of
      Bahá’u’lláh, that more appropriate curricula can gradually evolve. Yet,
      this is not a setting in which a few individuals are developing materials
      for their own use, and it does become necessary at some point to finalize
      the structure and content of each unit so that it may be used with
      confidence by others. The decision to release a final version of the
      materials for a given course is made simply when it is noticed that
      modifications are becoming negligible. It is important to note that the
      various aspects of this process of consultation, action and reflection are
      carried out parallel with one another, and not performed in a linear
      sequence which would be inherently artificial.",

      society is suffering from a process of disintegration that manifests
      itself in wars, terrorism, chaos, physical and psychological insecurity,
      and a widespread condition of material poverty. On the other hand, forces
      of integration are moving individuals and groups toward the adoption of
      new values, new forms of organization, and appropriate structures that can
      lay the foundation for the establishment of a new social order. The Ruhi
      Institute defines its basic aim as that of becoming a channel for the
      spiritual forces of our time to be applied to the lives of the masses of
      humanity, empowering them to contribute to the establishment of a new
      world civilization.",

    [
      "- In its efforts to understand and contribute to a process of social
      change, the Ruhi Institute tries to avoid two sets of theories that have
      dominated the discourse on development and change for too many decades. On
      the one hand, it disagrees with concepts of social change that are
      entirely individualistic in their outlook, which analyze society only in
      terms of the psychological make-up, the skills, and the behavior of the
      individual, and which assume thai social structures somehow will change by
      themselves once the individual is saved or correctly trained through
      religious conversion or secular education. On the other hand, it also
      rejects theories that consider the human being entirely as a product of
      society, and claim that no improvement is possible unless social
      structures, especially those related to political and economic power, are
      changed first. There are too many examples of participation by the
      “righteous” and the “highly trained” in the structures of oppression to
      allow any objective observer of social processes to accept proposals of
      change based entirely on the redemption of the individual without direct
      attention to social forces and structures. At the same time, history has
      already shown the evils of systems that deny individual freedom and derive
      their moral and social codes from a perception of the necessity of change
      in the structures of power, a change their proponents believe should be
      achieved at any cost.",
    ],
    [
      "The Ruhi Institute tries to understand the process of the transformation
      of human society in terms of a far more complex set of interactions
      between two parallel developments: the transformation of the individual,
      and the deliberate creation of the structures of a new society. Moreover,
      just as it does not view the human being as a mere product of interactions
      with nature and society, it does not identify structural change only with
      political and economic processes. Rather, it sees the necessity of change
      in all structures ~ mental, cultural, scientific and technological,
      educational, economic and social — including a complete change in the very
      concepts of political leadership and power. It is understood that
      individuals, all of whom possess a more or less developed spiritual
      nature, may be illumined by divine teachings, even under the influence of
      the most oppressive social forces. These individuals, then, by no means
      perfected, try to walk the path of social transformation, a path which,
      nevertheless, is not one of individual salvation but one which implies a
      constant effort to create and strengthen the institutions of a new social
      order. These new institutions, even when designed perfectly, may not
      function perfectly at first, but they do make it possible for an
      increasing number of human beings to walk further along the path of
      spiritual growth and transformation. This continuous interaction, between
      the parallel processes of the spiritualization of the individual and the
      establishment of new social structures, describes the only dependable path
      of social change, one that avoids both complacency and violence and does
      not perpetuate the cycles of oppression and illusory freedom that humanity
      has experienced in the past. According to this vision of social change,
      the Ruhi Institute directs its present efforts to develop human resources
      within a set of activities that conduce to spiritual and intellectual
      growth, but are carried out in the context of each individual’s
      contribution to the establishment of new structures - for now, mostly, in
      villages and rural regions.",
    ],

      "- Yet another important element of the conceptual framework of the Ruhi
      Institute is the concept of participation. Although by now most programs
      concerned with development and change accept the importance of
      participation by the local community in its own path of development and
      most try to avoid imposing their own projects and ideas, there usually is
      little clarity and agreement as to the nature, the form, and the extent of
      this participation. The Ruhi Institute, following the ideas presented in
      the previous paragraphs, asserts that effective participation which will
      not easily degenerate into political manipulation requires a systematic
      learning process within each community and region so that the community
      itself experiments with new ideas, new methods, and new technologies and
      procedures, rather than being the object of the social experimentation of
      others. Thus, one of the first steps in establishing participatory
      development processes in a region is to promote intensive participation by
      an increasing number of individuals in learning, in a constant effort to
      apply knowledge to improve the conditions of community life and to create
      and strengthen the institutions of a new world order.",

      energies are entirely directed towards promoting the well-being of the

      the process. The village youth who had participated in the institute
      courses were ready to carry out activities in service to the Faith as long
      as they were spurred on by their teachers, but their activities would
      dwindle as they took on the burdensome responsibilities of village life in
      Colombia. As the intensity of the collective projects of the national
      community decreased - and these had included regular visits to some 200
      villages and towns ~ the number of youth who participated in the courses
      of the institute also diminished. Devoted individuals, of course,
      continued with their services to the Faith, and a few communities
      dutifully attended to basic functions. But the momentum that had been
      built up over a period of seven years was lost in the short span of a few
      months. The decision to revert to what was referred to at the time as a
      “normal lifestyle” proved to have far-reaching consequences for the
      community’s future development. The ensuing period of slow, uneven and
      discontinuous growth, characterized by bursts of activity followed by
      months of quiet, lasted for about three years. When the results were
      finally analyzed and the implications of a more relaxed approach to the
      organization and promotion of teaching were understood, the National
      Spiritual Assembly and the Auxiliary Board members realized that the
      process of rebuilding collective consciousness and enthusiasm might well
      be the most difficult challenge they had ever faced.",

      "The event that marked the beginning of a gradual process of change was,
      unfortunately, the premature passing of the Hand of the Cause Rahmat’ulláh
      Muhájir in December of 1979. He had been a source of inspiration and
      courage to the Colombian friends since his first visit to that country in
      the 1960s, and had encouraged them every step of the way through crises
      and victories. He had laid the cornerstone of the building of the Ruhi
      Institute in Puerto Tejada, declaring unexpectedly that a future
      university was being established there. He had been somewhat displeased by
      the community’s decision to teach the Faith without the pressure of highly
      disciplined and intensive campaigns; his message to the National Spiritual
      Assembly on this subject had been a single sentence: “The less you expect,
      the less you achieve”. The believers were anxiously waiting for his next
      visit to consult with him on the direction of their future activities, but
      he passed away in Ecuador a few days before he would have reached Colombia
      and revitalized that community through his wise counsel and the
      inspiration of his words and example.",

    [
      "In a series of meetings of prayer and consultation, filled with the
      memory of Dr. Muhájir, the Colombian friends decided to dedicate eighteen
      months to intensive teaching in his name. But the mood of the community
      was still not inclined towards intensive campaigns. Thirty-six individuals
      arose, greatly moved by their love for Dr. Muhájir, and pledged to enroll
      at least five hundred new believers each. So that the pressures of high
      numerical goals would not lower the quality of teaching, the National
      Assembly asked the teachers to make at least three visits to each new
      believer within a few weeks after declaration and share with them a number
      of deepening booklets. During the next months, the thirty-six volunteers
      taught on their own, using their weekends and vacations, with such a high
      degree of devotion that by the middle of 1981 the number of adult Bahá’ís
      in Colombia had increased by another fifteen thousand, raising the total
      to about forty-five thousand.",
    ],
    [
      "Being acutely aware of the limitations of large-scale expansion without
      proportionate increase in the number of active teachers, the National
      Assembly asked the thirty-six individuals to form teams with as many
      believers as showed enthusiasm for teaching. Unlike groups of teachers
      that would come together only for the duration of a campaign, these would
      be permanent teams to which new believers who expressed the desire to
      serve would be constantly invited. The more experienced members of each
      team would endeavor to deepen the newer ones in an atmosphere of love and
      fellowship and help them reach ever-greater heights of devotion. As the
      number of team members approached twenty, they would be asked to divide
      into two teams, each carrying out the basic functions of deepening and
      teaching in communities easily accessible to them. The members of the
      National Assembly and the Auxiliary Board either joined a team or
      undertook the task of encouraging several teams by attending some of their
      weekly deepening meetings and participating in their weekend teaching
      projects.",
    ],
    [
      "This new method of organizing the teaching work once again mobilized the
      Colombian Bahá’í community. About a hundred youth who had already attended
      the courses of the Ruhi Institute quickly rallied behind the new plan of
      action. The permanent team structure now offered the institute the
      opportunity to decentralize its courses and hold them in towns and
      villages throughout the country. In fact, during this period the more
      experienced members of the teams, all of whom had close ties with the Ruhi
      Institute as its collaborators, initiated the development of several
      courses along various paths of service. The membership of some thirty
      teams did grow rapidly, and expansion and consolidation in the country
      gained considerable momentum. Yet the division of teams and formation of
      new ones proved far more difficult than expected. While the new members of
      the teams, like those who had attended the courses in Puerto Tejada before
      them, did become confirmed in their faith and developed love for teaching,
      the problem of initiative presented itself again. To increase the
      membership of a team to about twenty was easy, but to find individuals
      with enough maturity and dedication to form the nucleus of a new team,
      even after a year, was almost impossible. This essential difficulty
      finally forced the National Assembly to give up the idea of permanent
      teaching teams and explore alternative schemes to mobilize the national
      community for teaching. Yet it must be emphasized that once again in this
      new stage of growth, remarkable victories were won for the Faith in the
      country. Numerically, during the three years when permanent teams
      constituted the main component of the organization of teaching in
      Colombia, another ten thousand new believers joined the ranks of the
      followers of Bahá’u’lláh and the total number of adult Bahá’ís rose to
      about fifty-five thousand. Qualitatively, the community gained invaluable
      experience, especially in the administration of teaching plans, and took
      important strides towards greater spiritual maturity.",
    ],
    [
      "The difficulties that the permanent teaching teams faced as they tried to
      grow and multiply were quite puzzling to the institutions of the Faith in
      Colombia. It seemed clear to the institutions that they had discovered an
      excellent approach to the spiritual education of capable youth, as well as
      a simple scheme that would organize these youth to serve the Faith. By
      offering only a portion of the Ruhi Institute program — the first level of
      the Basic Deepening path ~ which required about eighty hours of group
      study and discussion, it was possible to inspire village youth to arise
      and participate effectively in the plans of the national community.
      Indeed, the receptivity of these youth was so great that the number of
      teachers who could be assisted through this straightforward deepening
      process seemed limitless. But growth continued to be relatively slow, now
      because of the scarcity of individuals who could coordinate groups and, at
      one level or another, administer the plans of expansion and consolidation.
      It was understood, of course, that other levels and paths of the
      institute’s evolving program would lead to the gradual increase in the
      number of such capable workers. Yet the time-scale was not satisfactory.
      Now that the challenge of increasing the number of teachers had been met,
      was there not a way to accelerate the maturation of these teachers and
      help a few of them assume quickly the more demanding responsibilities of
      coordination and administration?",

      "By now it will be clear that throughout its short history the Colombian
      community, like every other Bahá’í community in the world, has been
      continually challenged by the tasks of fostering devotion and cultivating
      the believers’ capacity to serve the Cause of Bahá’u’lláh. Its experience
      demonstrates that accelerated growth is achieved whenever successful
      efforts are made to develop human resources and endow the believers with
      new insights into the spiritual dynamics of growth and with new
      capabilities for service. But each success brings an expanded range of
      opportunities and a need for larger numbers of individuals able to render
      more specialized or complex services to the community. Such a pattern is,
      of course, natural to a healthy process of expansion and consolidation and
      is not a fault to be lamented. What is needed is a systematic response to
      these needs, bearing in mind that there will always be more opportunities
      than the community can possibly exploit.",
    ],
    [
      "It should be mentioned here that the development of human resources in
      the Faith cannot be pursued in accordance with certain control-oriented
      theories which are prevalent in the world today. Such theories hold that
      through prescribed diagnostic and planning procedures it is possible to
      determine the needs of a developing society for every type of expertise
      and labor, design the corresponding training programs, and deliver the
      specified human resources to run the society. Their application leads to
      rigid structures within which certain types of professionals dominate and
      control the destiny of those who are somehow below them in a false
      hierarchy of capacities. Their proponents put undue emphasis on
      professionalism, even to the point of equating the word “professional”
      with “excellent”, thus denying the excellence that can characterize every
      person’s contribution to society. The value of the Ruhi Institute derives
      precisely from its ability to respond systematically to the community’s
      growing needs for human resources without pretending to control the
      development of the Faith in Colombia through the creation of blueprints
      for growth or the establishment of cadres of “experts” and “skilled
      laborers”. The progress of the Faith in any country proceeds according to
      the dictates of Bahá’u’lláh’s mighty Will; individuals have the bounty of
      responding to His call and arising to serve Him. There is no need to
      predict every eventuality and train individuals for every type of service.
      Yet, the challenge of accelerating the development of capacity for
      increasingly complex types of service to the Faith has to be addressed by
      the institutions of a country.",
    ],
    [
      "Two assets of die experience of the Colombian community in recent years
      may contribute to a deeper appreciation of this challenge. One aspect has
      to do with the initial commitment of those who enter the Faith in a
      process of large-scale expansion. Despite their decision at an early stage
      to teach the Faith thoroughly, which proved essential to the ability to
      sustain large-scale enrollments over the years, the friends in Colombia
      made few explicit efforts to teach the people of greater capacity within
      the villages and neighborhoods. Anyone who accepted the Faith during the
      first contact was visited repeatedly and deepened; from among these
      believers, and especially from among their children and youth, the Ruhi
      Institute identified highly capable people and helped them become gifted
      servants of the Cause. Yet, insufficient thought was given to the
      potential benefits of making systematic plans for the enrollment of people
      who, though they might accept the Faith only after three or four visits,
      would enter it with a deeper commitment. Although it is only a hypothesis
      that needs to be tested through experience, adding such a component to
      large-scale teaching plans might have increased the number of individuals
      who could render complex services after a short period of deepening and
      orientation.",
    ],
    [
      "A word of caution may be in order concerning the concept of “capacity” as
      used in the paragraph above. In deliberations on the implications of this
      concept it is well to ask, “Capacity to do what?” and “How will the
      community use the capacity that is to be gained?”. It is clear that for
      its growth the Bahá’í community needs people with highly diverse
      capacities. In order to reach effectively all strata of society and
      influence the direction of social processes, the Faith must count among
      its followers individuals of such diverse backgrounds that its voice may
      be heard in every social setting. Yet, capacity need not be identified
      solely with social prestige, material resources, academic degrees, or
      access to the power structures of society, although it is indispensable
      that Bahá’í communities reach out to people of prestige and academic
      distinction. As far as large-scale expansion among the masses is
      concerned, the capabilities that have proven to be limiting factors, and
      which the Ruhi Institute has only managed to develop slowly in its
      participants, are unfortunately not taught in schools and universities and
      have little to do with wealth and power. The spiritual attributes which
      enable a person to work effectively among the oppressed masses of the
      world, those special qualities of leadership that permit one to coordinate
      a team of teachers who are working with devotion and sincerity in the
      villages for months on end, the ability to envision large-scale movements
      and processes of transformation, the intellectual tools one needs in order
      to contribute to strategic planning towards those ends: none of these
      endowments is related, at this stage in history, to one’s position in
      society or one’s level of formal education. For this reason, while the
      search for people of capacity is relevant to the problems that the
      Colombian Bahá’í community has faced in the coordination and
      administration of large-scale expansion and consolidation, let it not be
      forgotten that the entire analysis could only be pursued within a
      framework that is unique to the Faith and does not subscribe to the values
      of the societies in which we live.",
    ],
    [
      "A second aspect of the experience in Colombia which sheds light on the
      challenge of building capacity for increasingly complex service to the
      Faith concerns the matter of intensity. When the Colombian friends
      analyzed the different stages of their short history they were led to an
      interesting realization. It seemed to them that during the early stages,
      when campaigns and activities were carried out with a great deal of
      intensity and demanded a high level of sacrifice, some of the believers
      became imbued with such a strong sense of purpose and dedication that they
      did not waver throughout the triumphs and trials of their service to the
      Faith. When, through the Ruhi Institute, they learned how to help a larger
      number of believers to walk the beginnings of their paths of service, in a
      process that was slower and more relaxed, the number of confirmed
      believers and willing workers for the Cause increased, but only a few
      experienced the accelerated maturation that had characterized the lives of
      the teachers who entered the arena of service a decade before them.
      Intensity of experience, then, seemed to be another all-important factor
      that the community had missed for a few years and, once again, would have
      to incorporate in the plans of action.",
    ],
    [
      "Based on this new insight, the National Spiritual Assembly decided to add
      to the plans another component: highly intensive national campaigns of
      expansion and consolidation, to be held once or twice a year. In these
      campaigns, which have been carried out regularly in Colombia since 1983,
      groups of five to ten teachers visit one of the 300 communities where a
      Local Spiritual Assembly exists, and pursue a program of activities that
      includes the deepening of the teachers themselves, visits to homes in an
      effort to enroll entire families in the Faith, classes for children and
      youth, and dramatizations of diverse aspects of Bahá’í life presented in
      large community meetings. Where possible, all of these activities are
      carried out in consultation with the Local Spiritual Assembly. All the
      participants are conscious that the campaigns are not only concerned with
      expansion and consolidation of the communities, and that their greatest
      value lies in the unique opportunities they offer to the teachers to renew
      their sense of dedication to the Faith. The coordinators of the groups,
      therefore, are asked to create a very high sense of spiritual discipline
      and sustain it throughout the week. Participants accept that for a week or
      two they will live frugally, eating as the poorest among the villagers do
      and staying as guests in the humble homes which arc generously opened to
      them. From early morning until late at night, the group is entirely
      focused on spiritual matters and constantly immersed in the Writings,
      whether sharing them with others or studying among themselves. Yet, it
      must be remembered that this is the discipline of joy and happiness, and
      an experienced coordinator does not have to impose it on the participants.
      Nor is the desire to strive for high levels of sacrifice and detachment
      induced through emotional appeals designed to whip up superficial
      excitement It arises from a collective decision of the community to leave
      behind the concerns of daily life for a few weeks each year, and render
      service to His Threshold with such intensity that souls may be endowed
      with new capacities and powers. The National Assembly and the Auxiliary
      Board members have done everything possible to ensure that
      expansion-consolidation campaigns remain a regular and organic element of
      community life in Colombia. Their success can be measured by the simple
      fact that while only eight people participated in the first campaign in
      1983, during the summer of 1989 the national campaign enlisted the
      participation of more than 400 dedicated teachers.",

    [
      "The story of large-scale teaching endeavors is certainly not unique to
      Colombia. Numerous communities throughout the world have responded
      creatively to the challenges of growth in the past few decades, and the
      Cause has advanced with remarkable rapidity since the opening years of the
      Ten Year Crusade. The question that often arises when a specific
      initiative is under scrutiny is whether it has succeeded in winning
      lasting victories for the Faith. What the story of the Ruhi Institute
      demonstrates is that this deceptively straightforward question cannot be
      answered by applying simplistic criteria of success and failure. How docs
      one measure the success of a process that in each country is destined to
      culminate in the conquest of the hearts of a majority of the inhabitants
      and in the establishment of the structures of a new world order? How does
      one speak of successes and failures of men and women who, cognizant of
      their utter weakness and impotence, try to contribute, no matter how
      modestly, to a spiritual drama which only unfolds according to the
      all-pervading Will of God? It is in recognition of this difficulty,
      inherent to the analysis of Bahá’í efforts, that the dialectic of crisis
      and victory, rather than an assessment of success and failure, emerges as
      the organizing parameter within which to examine a national community’s
      experience in large-scale teaching. Thus, to complete the analysis of the
      Ruhi Institute, what remains is to decide whether, at the beginning of the
      decade of the 1990s when these pages are being written, the Colombian
      Bahá’í community finds itself at a point of crisis or stands at one of its
      moments of victory. To a reader who is well aware of the dynamic interplay
      between crisis and victory, it should not be disappointing to find out
      that this, in fact, is a time of crisis.",

    [
      "Let it not be assumed from the foregoing statement that the community is
      burdened with problems or caught in a state of stagnancy. On the contrary,
      at this moment Colombia stands out as a healthy and vibrant Bahá’í
      community. There is a high degree of unity and the friends are working in
      concert to pursue parallel lines of action for the spiritual enrichment of
      their lives, the education of children, the promotion of a youth movement,
      proclamation, teaching at individual and collective levels, the
      strengthening of local, regional and national institutions, and the
      application of the Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh to some of the problems of
      their society. Expansion-consolidation campaigns are carried out
      regularly, and with each campaign a few thousand new Bahá’ís join the
      community. The Youth Year of Service program is highly successful, as is
      the work with junior youth in dozens of villages. Under the guidance of
      the Continental Board of Counsellors, the Ruhi Institute has even reached
      out to other Bahá’í communities in Latin America, helping them train
      workers for the Cause and assisting with the development of their
      permanent institutes. Yet, none of these achievements is very satisfying
      when one considers both the opportunities and the need for large-scale
      expansion of the Faith in Colombia.",

      "A spiritually refreshing campaign that brings two or three thousand new
      believers into the Faith is truly exhilarating, but in a Latin American
      country, the annual addition of three thousand people to a community of
      fifty to sixty thousand merely compensates for the mortality rate. The
      existence of some 150 children’s classes, compared with the number of such
      classes in other national communities of similar size, is praiseworthy,
      but it involves only about three thousand children from among the fifty
      thousand or more that should correspond to the number of adult believers.

      are the opportunities and so compelling the cry of the masses in this

      disintegration, that Ilie Colombian community cannot rest on the
      accomplishments of the past nor abandon the aspirations that have animated
      its development for the past two decades.",

      Colombian Bahá’í community to emerge from its present state of crisis.
      Yet, from among the different ideas being explored, a few thoughts are
      beginning to crystallize and may suggest courses of action for the future.
      It is clear from the foregoing account that the accomplishments of the
      Colombian community have mainly resulted from the spiritual empowerment of
      individuals. There is no doubt that through the Ruhi Institute the
      institutions of the Faith have learned how to raise the level of
      consciousness of an increasing number of individuals from among the masses
      and imbue them with qualities and capabilities that enable them to arise
      and serve the Faith. But comparable results have not been achieved in the
      development of local Bahá’í communities. For this reason it has been
      extremely difficult for individuals, and even for many of the
      collaborators of the Ruhi Institute, who are scattered throughout a vast
      and difficult country, to maintain a high level of energy when their local
      institutions are weak and tentative, and when there is no collective will
      of a local community from which the believer can receive direction and
      support. It is true that, in the long term, through the education of
      children and youth, communities can be developed and Local Spiritual
      Assemblies gradually strengthened. But the challenge of community
      development cannot be entirely postponed to a distant future. Is not the
      next step for the Bahá’ís of Colombia, then, to search for powerful
      methods that would imbue entire local communities with a sense of mission,
      raise their collective consciousness, and create environments conducive to
      individual and social transformation?",
