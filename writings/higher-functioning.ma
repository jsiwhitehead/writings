      "In its message dated 29 December 2015 to the Conference of the
      Continental Boards of Counsellors, the Universal House of Justice stated
      that attaining a higher level of functioning is a pressing concern of
      training institutes. This concern comes into sharp focus when viewed in
      the context of the goals before the Bahá’í world during this Five Year
      Plan: to

      "The community’s efforts to fortify programmes of growth in thousands of
      clusters and sustain their intensification will place heavy demands on
      these agencies. Their focus, of course, is the unfoldment of the three
      stages of the educational process they oversee and the strengthening of
      the process of learning associated with each, so that both the quality of
      the institute’s activities and the capacity to extend them to ever-growing
      numbers are constantly rising.",
    ],
    "In the institutional meetings held across the world to prepare for the
    beginning of the current Five Year Plan, the friends benefited from viewing
    what was happening in each cluster from two perspectives. The first,
    engaging in three-monthly cycles of activity through which the community
    grows, with attention to teaching the Faith and conversation with those from
    the wider society, and, the second, the unfoldment of the three educational
    imperatives overseen by the training institute. Regarding the latter, the
    House of Justice has stated the following:",

      quote:
        'Message dated 12 December 2011 written by the Universal House of Justice to all National Spiritual Assemblies.'
      ,
      "In this context, one speaks of three educational imperatives, each
      distinguished by its own methods and materials, each claiming a share of
      resources, and each served by mechanisms to systematize experience and to
      generate knowledge based on insights gained in the field. Quite naturally,
      then, three discussions take shape around the implementation of the
      programme for the spiritual education of children, the junior youth
      spiritual empowerment programme, and the main sequence of courses.",
    ],
    "To help the friends managing the operations of training institutes to
    respond to current exigencies, this document shares some insights from the
    body of experience that has accrued in the Bahá’í world about implementing
    the main sequence of courses, the junior youth spiritual empowerment
    programme, and the programme for the spiritual education of children. The
    document also addresses matters related to the institutional capacity of
    training institutes. It is hoped that in each region or country the friends
    responsible for the institute’s endeavours will, taking their particular
    circumstances and experience into consideration, use these insights to
    further systematize their efforts.",

  [
    title: 'The Main Sequence Of Courses',
    "As is generally understood, the study of institute courses in a given
    cluster often starts with only a small group of participants who then begin
    to offer one or another of the acts of service the courses recommend. For
    the process of growth to advance meaningfully, the number of people studying
    institute courses must continue to rise. The principal issues that lie at
    the heart of this objective include raising the number and enhancing the
    capacity of those serving as tutors, sustaining a steady flow of
    participants through the sequence of courses, and coordinating the
    institute’s efforts through effective mechanisms.",
    [
      title: 'Raising the Number and Enhancing the Capacity of Tutors',
      "Fundamental to strengthening the educational programmes of the training
      institute is a steadily increasing number of capable tutors who, over
      time, are assisted to grow in effectiveness.",
      [
        title: 'The initial cadre of tutors',
        [
          "Institutes face a number of questions with regard to clusters where a
          programme of growth is nascent, among them: how to meaningfully extend
          the reach of the study of institute courses to each cluster, and how
          to ensure that
          <
            q: 'Message dated 29 December 2015.',
            "within a reasonable period, some among those residing in a cluster
            are enabled to serve as tutors",
          />.",
        ],
        "Local friends in clusters with new programmes of growth have initially
        relied on participating in the study of the courses offered by
        experienced tutors in more advanced clusters nearby or farther afield.
        They have also benefited from the services of one or two carefully
        selected and prepared visiting tutors drawn from the strong clusters who
        in some instances also serve as homefront pioneers for a short or long
        term. In either case, the tutors involved are most effective when they
        appreciate that they are promoting a process with far-reaching
        implications for the spiritual and material life of a population.
        Besides assisting the first batch of friends to arise and serve, through
        the courses they offer the tutors help build a strong foundation of
        understanding and experience on which the institute process is gradually
        erected.",
        "Yet, it is not until some of the local friends begin serving as tutors
        that the institute truly takes root in a cluster and the number of those
        studying institute courses increases significantly. The first steps in
        this regard may be to encourage a few friends from among those who have
        studied the early courses and gained some experience with the related
        activities to begin helping others study the courses. Visiting tutors
        may begin by calling on these friends to help in leading discussions of
        sections of the materials and organizing the related practices. They
        might also delve with them deeper into challenging aspects of the study
        and practice under way. In this manner, some local friends are carefully
        enabled to start offering others at least the first two courses of the
        sequence. An in-depth review of these courses, carried out together with
        a study of portions of Ruhi Institute Book 7 and the continued aid of an
        experienced tutor, may further prepare the local friends for this task.
        As they serve in this manner and progress in their own study of the
        courses, their capacity to help others who desire to serve grows.",
        "Where this approach is wisely applied, it sets a number of people on
        the path of learning how to facilitate a process through which the
        capacity of individuals eager to contribute to intensifying the
        community-building process is built. Further, by helping larger numbers
        of people to study institute courses, it provides as early as possible a
        growing base of participation by the local friends in the related
        activities. But a word of caution is in order. The desired outcomes are
        less likely to occur if the process of raising tutors becomes one in
        which everyone is asked to form a study group the moment he or she
        finishes one or two courses. Insuch instances, great effort may be
        expended and large numbers briefly obtained, but the results sought of
        enabling ever more people to promote the community-building process
        remain elusive.",
      ],
      [
        title: 'An expanding body of tutors',
        "When the services of one or two visiting tutors are reinforced by a few
        local friends who are learning to offer institute courses, this team of
        five or so individuals makes it possible to expand the number of people
        studying the courses and initiating activities, thus intensifying the
        work under way and propelling the cluster on its path of progress to
        move beyond the second milestone.",
        "Yet, the cluster requires an expanding body of tutors if it is to
        continue to advance. If in each cluster the number of those capable of
        serving as tutors is to rise, more people from among those promoting
        teaching and community-building activities have to keep advancing along
        the sequence of courses. For it is only when ever-growing contingents
        are immersed in concurrent and sustained study and service that the body
        of effective tutors meaningfully expands. This underscores the
        cumulative character of the capacity-building process engendered by the
        sequence of courses. With each course studied, knowledge of the Faith
        increases, insights into spiritual matters deepen, spiritual
        susceptibilities expand, requisite qualities and attitudes develop, and
        skills and abilities sharpen. Individuals grow in the ability to
        investigate the Sacred Writings, to understand the reality of their
        community, and to engage in conversations of significance. They become
        better able to consult on their needs, to collaborate with others, and
        to reflect on and improve their efforts. As they become ever more
        conscious of the divine assistance surrounding them, they grow in
        confidence. When such an experience embraces more and more people, and
        many of them after studying Book 7 are assisted to form a study circle
        and serve as tutors, they apply all these abilities in efforts to
        accompany others on the path of service. In this manner, a cluster
        eventually comes to be served by a score or more local friends capable
        of acting as tutors. Through their efforts the number of individuals who
        are enabled to start and sustain core activities and other acts of
        service in the cluster steadily grows.",

          "From the beginning of the sequence of courses, a participant
          encounters Bahá’u’lláh’s Revelation in considering such weighty themes
          as worship, service to humanity, the life of the soul, and the
          education of children and youth. As a person cultivates the habit of
          study and deep reflection upon the Creative Word, this process of
          transformation reveals itself in an ability to express one’s
          understanding of profound concepts and to explore spiritual reality in
          conversations of significance. These capacities are visible not only
          in the elevated discussions that increasingly characterize

          peers— extending to include parents whose daughters and sons are
          benefiting from the community’s programmes of education. Through

          and common calling is fortified, confidence that a better world can be

        help to illustrate this point.",
        "In a village or neighbourhood where a small group begins to study Book
        1, the participants naturally converse on such spiritual matters as the
        Word of God, prayer, and the life of the soul. Praying, reading the
        writings, and taking oneself into account begin to take root among them
        as a daily discipline. Possibility for exploring together other themes
        from the writings of the Faith grows when these friends are offered and
        begin reading the Hidden Words, as recommended in the first unit of Book
        1. The reach of this conversation expands when they initiate visits to
        the homes of their friends and neighbours to share prayers. The
        introduction of a few devotional meetings provides a space where more
        people, Bahá’í or not, gather to pray and reflect on the implications of
        the Writings for their individual and collective life. This seemingly
        simple advance becomes a means for inviting to the study of institute
        courses those who show receptivity, leading to an increase in people
        entering the path of service.",
        "When some among those who have completed Book 1 come to study Book 2,
        the themes and concepts on which they deliberate with others broaden to
        include, for example, the eternal Covenant, unity in the community,
        Bahá’í principles relating to various social teachings, and others that
        arise as the friends learn to respond to the needs of the hearer. The
        homes they visit in this connection become additional venues for
        profound conversations. Bahá’u’lláh’s teachings on the spiritual
        instruction of children—and on the part individuals, families, and the
        community play in this regard—begin to be considered as some study Book
        3 and a few children’s classes are formed. Even a simple event convened
        with some regularity for families and neighbours to find out what the
        children are learning elevates discussion on the meaning and implication
        of a community nurturing its children spiritually.",

          deeply on the Persons of Bahá’u’lláh and the Báb and on the interplay

          study of Book 5 fuels exchanges on Bahá’í teachings relating to
          spiritually empowering the junior youth, which, given the societal

        tutors grows, the capacity to establish study circles necessarily
        increases. Apart from helping growing numbers to arise and serve,
        well-functioning study circles foster among the friends and between them
        and the institutions loving and mutually supportive interactions that
        bind these protagonists of the Plan together in unified action.",
        "Study circles derive much of their effectiveness from the fact that
        they each constitute a small group of friends who study the courses
        together in a local setting with the explicit purpose of learning to
        apply Bahá’í teachings to their personal and collective life and to thus
        contribute to a profound process of change. In an environment marked by
        sincere friendship and common purpose, the members study the institute
        courses, engage in service and extracurricular activities, and promote
        this mode of learning to others. As more and more friends serve as
        tutors, various segments of a community’s inhabitants—youth, women,
        mothers, couples, young professionals, and families—come to be
        accommodated in the study of the courses and to play a part in efforts
        to promote spiritual and material well-being. The study circles become
        distinct features of the life of the community when they operate with a
        measure of formality, incorporating elements such as a formal beginning
        and ending, a certain membership, and a defined schedule. Also, diverse

        courses when a degree of flexibility is allowed—the members, for
        instance, adjust as needed the pace at which they perform the various

        concludes, others might join as the study of a new one commences. To
        ensure that the study of any particular course is not overly prolonged,

        sequence of courses, study circles usually operate alongside institute
        campaigns. In clusters where there is great receptivity, campaigns might
        for a while even be the main mode of course delivery. Involving the
        intensive study of two or more institute courses over a relatively short
        time, institute campaigns are held at all levels of the community—local,
        cluster or group of clusters, regional, or national. The institutions

        involved in planning and providing resources, and the campaigns are most
        effective when they are scheduled during times of the year when many
        people can participate. A team of tutors— some perhaps drawn from other
        communities or clusters—may be tasked with implementing the campaign;
        these friends are required to give creative thought to carrying out the
        practical components and accompanying the participants to initiate or
        extend their acts of service. When offered in a locality, campaigns not
        only increase a community’s human resources within a short period but

        agencies might gather all those studying institute courses to reflect
        with them on their studies and services, to nurture their commitment,
        and to help them integrate into the life of the community. As for the
        training institute, its responsibility is to design, based on local
        circumstances, an approach to course delivery that coherently combines
        study circles and institute campaigns so that capacity to enable

        still nascent, support might come from a homefront pioneer, a veteran
        tutor or a coordinator from a nearby cluster, an Auxiliary Board member
        or an assistant, or a regional or national coordinator. As more local
        friends begin serving as tutors, the most experienced among them
        complement such external assistance by beginning to help others. Often,
        after a cluster has passed the second milestone, the number of local

      they ensure that the number of those acting as tutors rises and capacity
      among them to offer the full range of institute courses advances. They pay
      special attention to promoting the study of Book 7, help tutors to form
      study circles, and aid them to learn to facilitate effectively the study
      of the courses and the implementation of the practical components. New
      tutors especially require help inviting people to study the institute
      courses and enabling the participants to grasp the purpose and workings of
      a study circle. They often also benefit from receiving assistance in
      facilitating the first few sections of whatever course they are offering.
      Through such support, the tutors come to appreciate that individuals
      persist in their studies when they see themselves growing in
      understanding, enhancing their capabilities for service, and engaging in
      spiritually enriching interactions. To help the tutors foster such
      conditions in their study circles, coordinators, as stated earlier,

      the timely appointment of cluster coordinators. By working together with
      the cluster coordinators in the field and bringing them together in

      capacity to support the tutors. Appreciating the need for all coordinators
      at the cluster level to benefit from what is being learned across the

      coordinators that often involve visits to clusters where relevant

        this age group, most of which is clearly articulated in Book 5 of the
        sequence of courses. This conversation also provides opportunity to
        reflect on certain elements of the culture of the population that are
        conducive or contrary to the spiritual empowerment of young people.
        Noteworthy too is engaging ever-growing numbers of youth in systematic
        conversations on

          generations",
        />.
        Inviting the youth to study institute courses is an essential aspect
        that is fostered from the very start, and this is only possible when
        capable tutors of Book 5, whether visiting or local, are available to
        each cluster. The study of that course is most effective when in
        determining how to offer it, the conditions of the youth and their
        experience are taken into account.",
      ],
      "Once a few groups are formed, sustaining them depends on how the
      animators are accompanied to learn to facilitate effectively the study of
      the junior youth texts and to complement it with artistic activities,
      social interaction, and service projects. Pairing them with experienced
      animators when possible, gathering them in periodic meetings to review the
      texts, enabling them to learn from others more experienced, bringing them
      together in occasions to study the institute courses and the junior youth
      texts are all proved to be effective ways in which they can be supported.
      If animators are to grow in capacity to not just help junior youth but
      also contribute in various ways to bettering their communities, they
      gradually have to be assisted to appreciate the full extent of the
      community-building process unfolding locally and the context within which
      the junior youth programme is unfolding.",
      "Helping more and more youth to serve as animators contributes both to an
      increase in the number of groups and to the stability and resilience of
      the programme. With more trained animators, those that leave can be more
      easily replaced, and if one animator is unable to facilitate the study of
      a particular text, an experienced colleague steps in. When the junior
      youth in the groups functioning in a village or neighbourhood, or even in
      a cluster, are seen as enrolled into one educational system and their
      animators as collaborators in supporting all of them, occasions for coming
      together to study some of the texts in camps or to implement service
      projects together become a more pronounced feature of the programme in a
      cluster.",
      "The programme is strengthened when those overseeing it in a cluster have
      explicit and reasonable expectations of what can be accomplished over the
      course of a year. Currently nine texts are available to the junior youth.
      While it is at present anticipated that the junior youth will go through
      at least three texts in the first year, establishing a rhythm of study
      that guarantees such progress sometimes proves difficult. This challenge
      is best met when the way in which the programme is implemented takes into
      account the circumstances of the young people—both junior youth and
      youth—in the community, the various activities in which they are engaged
      at school and at home, the general pattern of life of their community, and
      the periods during the year of intense and of relaxed activity. Such
      understanding sets the stage for how in a cluster the junior youth will
      proceed through the texts during a year—when, for instance, they will
      study at a regular pace in their groups and when they will all be brought
      together in camps for intensive study and service.",
      "Yet another aspect of capacity to establish a sound and steadily
      expanding programme in a cluster is the involvement of the parents and the
      entire community. The conversations that occur as a group is formed and
      continue throughout its life help to build unity of vision, thought, and
      action. Occasions when the parents meet and the community gathers to
      reflect on the progress and efforts of the junior youth both extend this
      conversation and inject into the programme the necessary vitality. When
      they consult, the parents and the animators explore together the
      programme’s underlying concepts, efforts to promote junior youth groups in
      the community and with other families, ways to acquire the essential
      materials, and means to mobilize resources for camps and other collective
      endeavours.",
      "As each cluster moves towards the second milestone and beyond, training
      institutes everywhere will focus on building the capacity to raise the
      junior youth programme to this basic level. To assist them in this regard,
      the Office of Social and Economic Development at the Bahá’í World Centre
      has captured the knowledge and insights thus far generated in a document
      titled “Developing the capacity to engage 50 to 100 participants in the
      junior youth spiritual empowerment programme”. The remarks above summarize
      some of the document’s contents. It is hoped that it will be studied by
      all the friends promoting the programme at the national, regional, and
      cluster levels.",
    ],
    [
      title: 'Clusters Where the Friends are Learning to Embrace Large Numbers',
      "In all clusters where the capacity described above is present, the
      friends are now striving to cultivate further the associated interrelated
      abilities. They are enhancing capacity to engage at least a few hundred
      junior youth in tens of groups, reaching in this regard some 300 junior
      youth in about 30 or so groups. One question before them in this
      connection is how to increase capacity to raise growing numbers of
      animators in neighbourhoods and villages that are becoming centres of
      intense activity, some of which may be ripe for enlisting in the groups
      the majority, if not all, of the local junior youth. Earlier in the
      cluster’s development, one or two tutors of Book 5 may have sufficed to
      raise the initial cohort of animators. At this point, more of such tutors
      are required if growing numbers of youth, and beyond them parents and
      members of local institutions, are to study the course. Attention to the
      quality of the junior youth groups also becomes more pronounced. Animators
      are closely accompanied to learn how to consciously help the junior youth
      enhance the power of their expression, the acuity of their perception, and
      the depth of their interaction. Ongoing and creative thought is given to
      service projects initiated by the groups. By drawing other members of the
      community into these projects, those initiatives showing great promise are
      sustained over longer periods. With such progress, the junior youth
      programme attracts the support of many of the local people and leaders who
      lend a hand through several means. Additionally, opportunities to form
      junior youth groups in other settings such as schools and community
      centres arise over time. In these various ways every aspect of the
      learning experience in which the young people are immersed comes to impact
      markedly their life and that of the community in general.",
      "Besides accompanying them in their service, youth serving as animators
      are supported in other ways as well. In the context of their service to
      the Faith and the community, they are, for instance, encouraged in their
      formal education and assisted to think about the prospects for tertiary
      training and for career development before them. During reflection
      gatherings, animators deliberate also on such matters and on other noble
      aspirations. In this they receive the aid of not only the institute
      coordinators but also other institutions and agencies of the Faith, such
      as Auxiliary Board members and Local Spiritual Assemblies.",
      "In a community where the programme has reached such a level of
      quantitative and qualitative progress, rich conversations on the moral and
      intellectual well-being of young people proliferate. These conversations
      take place in the homes and during occasions such as devotional
      gatherings, community meetings, and institutional conferences. They also
      become a feature of the expansion phase of the cycle of activities.
      Gradually, the programme’s fundamental concepts, aims, and objectives come
      to be expressed through other means of communication, for instance, drama,
      music, or film. Where the programme is operating at this level, large
      numbers of animators are sustaining their efforts from year to year and
      progressively more youngsters are continuing in the groups for the
      programme’s three-year duration. A growing number of them are beginning to
      enter the main sequence of courses and to offer acts of service.",
      "As has been mentioned, there are about 70 clusters worldwide where the
      programme is reaching this level of development and the friends are
      involving more than 300 junior youth in the groups. In some of these
      clusters the number of participants even exceeds 1,000. Achieving the
      progress described above in several hundred more clusters where the
      friends are learning to embrace large numbers is an important aspect of
      the current Plan. The part to be played by learning sites in this regard
      is critical, for they ensure that the process of learning associated with
      each further stage of the programme’s growth is effectively extended and
      systematized in the clusters with which they are associated. And as
      capacity exists, they collaborate with training institutes to carry the
      work to other advanced clusters.",

    [
      title: 'Coordination of Junior Youth Groups',
      "All of these efforts depend on there being at every point in the
      programme’s advance a scheme for accompanying animators that matches the
      need. As the groups multiply and become more established, the
      organizational scheme in place evolves in complexity. In the early stages,
      the support of an experienced individual from a cluster close by may be
      adequate. This is soon supplemented by animators working in teams and the
      assistance of the more experienced among them. Eventually one or more
      coordinators are named from among the local animators. As they take on
      their responsibilities they learn from veteran coordinators in more
      advanced clusters and collaborate closely with the cluster coordinator of
      the main sequence and of children’s classes, if and when they are in
      place.",
      "At the regional or national level, a coordinator is named usually from
      among the most experienced cluster coordinators. As the number of junior
      youth groups increase across the region or country, an additional
      coordinator or two is named. The regional or national coordinators work
      with the cluster coordinators in the field and bring them together in
      meetings of reflection. Capacity to support the programme advances greatly
      when a team emerges at the regional or national level composed of the
      coordinators and other experienced individuals who, in collaboration with
      the Auxiliary Board members, have a clear vision of the growth of the
      programme across the entire region or country. As is the case at the
      cluster level, close collaboration with the coordinators of the main
      sequence and the children’s education programme is an important aspect of
      the mode of operation at the regional or national level.",
      "Further, for capacity to grow, the institute and the learning site, where
      one is in place, foster a dynamic collaboration. The regional or national
      coordinators and the resource persons work together in the field and,
      through such spaces as learning site seminars and institute gatherings,
      learn from one another. The knowledge and experience that emerge from the
      network of clusters associated with a learning site is transferred to the
      training institute, and the insights generated by the training institute
      in further extending the reach of the programme is shared with the
      learning sites.",

        Over the last Plan, the number of children participating in the classes
        expanded significantly, reaching over 210,000 globally. The growing
        capacities of institutes to train teachers and assist them to form
        classes, and the expanding mechanisms to support their service and
        progress, are among the factors that have contributed to such growth.

        Initially most of such individuals are drawn from among the experienced
        teachers and tutors in the more advanced clusters. When they learn to
        offer Book 3 in a manner that raises the understanding of the
        participants, enhances their commitment to the education of children,
        and sharpens their skills and abilities, the spiritual education of
        children is established on a strong footing.",

        the population, young mothers and youth—both boys and girls—tend to be
        the first to respond. Mothers bring to the effort their experience of
        parenting and more readily engage other parents in related
        conversations. As for the youth, when they are involved in deep
        discussions on their responsibility to the community, they respond
        especially well when invited to work with children and junior youth.
        Building a team of a few mothers and youth who collaborate to teach the
        first few classes should be a possibility within the reach of every
        cluster.",

        these three courses, among them developing spiritual identity and
        habits, engaging in systematic conversations, and teaching a simple
        class of children, are relevant to a children’s class teacher.
        Nevertheless, some flexibility in how individuals proceed through these
        courses is often necessary in the early stages. Friends interested in
        teaching children have sometimes studied the first and third courses,
        formed classes, and then proceeded to study the second and other
        courses. In some instances, forming children’s classes is integrated
        into the study of Book 3, so that by the time the teachers finish the
        course some classes have already begun. Whatever approach is initially

        classes with increasing regularity, become adept at handling the various
        components of the lessons in the first grade, and strengthen
        relationships with parents. In this regard, the teachers meet often to
        review the lessons, explore their principle spiritual objectives, share
        experiences, and determine how to assist one another. To continue to
        grow in capacity, the teachers persist in their study of institute
        courses. As relevant experience accrues, the teachers’ commitment to
        spiritually educating children strengthens, and so does that of the
        parents and the community in general. This enables a community to
        sustain the initial classes established.",
        "The teachers’ ability to collaborate with parents is another pertinent
        issue at this initial stage. Teachers learn to periodically visit
        parents in their homes to acquaint them with the progress being made and
        to elicit whatever assistance is necessary. Efforts to enhance this
        vital relationship are seamlessly integrated into the various activities
        associated with implementing the programme. For instance, teachers and
        parents study or review segments of Book 3 together, and parents
        occasionally join the teachers when they come together for reflection.
        The teachers and parents are, as a result, increasingly engaged in a
        conversation that nurtures among them a deep sense of solidarity. This
        conversation is gradually extended within the community, fostering

      a small team of collaborators, can support 10 to 15 teachers, an
      additional coordinator is often required as the number of classes expands
      further. In any case, an organizational scheme emerges over time in an
      advanced cluster which accommodates teams of collaborating teachers,
      experienced teachers that help the coordinators support others, and a
      number of coordinators that ensure that the classes are being sustained,
      the teachers are growing in capacity, and the families and the entire

      of the support provided. Making certain that each cluster is served by
      some organizational scheme, including drawing on coordinators and
      experienced individuals from other clusters as needed, is another. As
      coordinators emerge in cluster after cluster, those serving at the

      materials in sufficient quantities and appropriate languages are provided
      to the teachers and children at all ages. Careful attention to the flow of
      knowledge from advanced clusters where a greater range of experience is
      being generated makes it possible for other clusters to benefit and
      advance expeditiously. And, as is the case with the main sequence of
      courses and the junior youth programme, over time a team emerges at the

      depends on the strength of the institute as an agency of the Faith
      operating at the level of a country or region. There are currently over
      300 training institutes worldwide, which range in scope from those in
      small countries with a handful of clusters with a programme of growth to
      those in large regions where the number of such clusters might exceed 100.
      In all but a few cases, these institutes operate under a board of
      directors. Although in general all boards bear the same responsibilities,
      their particular operations vary depending on the range of the institute’s
      work. At any rate, it is vital that members of a board, national or
      regional coordinators, Auxiliary Board members, and a cadre of believers
      with the relevant experience learn to collaborate effectively in
      supporting the institute’s various responsibilities.",
      "Irrespective of the scope of the work of the institute, the board and
      those with whom it closely collaborates in a region or country strive to
      enhance a number of related institutional capacities. They endeavour to
      formulate a clear vision of the progress of the educational processes,
      foster capacity to learn systematically and to disseminate the accruing
      knowledge, and support a healthy evolution of the institute’s
      organizational schemes at the cluster and regional levels. They also
      labour to raise capable human resources for the institute’s various
      purposes, manage effectively financial and material resources, and address
      pertinent administrative concerns, especially in relation to institute
      staff and statistics. The complexity of each of these issues naturally

      development is, of course, provided in the messages of the Universal House
      of Justice. As the friends study the guidance, read the reality of their
      country or region, and reflect on their experience, they are able to
      formulate a vision centred on advancing the two essential movements at the
      heart of the process of growth: the steady flow of individuals through the
      sequence of courses offered by the training institute and the movement of
      clusters along a continuum of development. In the context of this general
      vision for the country or region, the institute articulates its own
      particular vision for the spiritual education of the friends for the
      duration of the Plan. This might involve not only what is possible to
      accomplish in each cluster with regard to the three educational
      imperatives but also the main strategies and approaches to be pursued. The
      institute then formulates annually a plan and budget, and every cycle an
      operational plan. Where capacity for such methodical planning is well
      developed, the work of the institute is characterized by clarity of
      thought and systematic action. Its lines of action are well-defined, and
      the deliberations among the friends at the forefront of its operations are

        On their part, regional or national coordinators labour in the field
        together with cluster coordinators, converse with them on their
        experiences, and observe first hand the emerging strengths and
        challenges. Regular reflection gatherings that are informed by what is
        happening at the grassroots allow for a deep exploration of the
        unfolding experience in the region or country. The deliberations and
        endeavours of coordinators might for a period of time concentrate on
        particular sets of questions that are critical to achieving continued
        progress. The insights obtained from such focused efforts are then
        appropriately analysed and shared with others. A cluster in which
        significant experience is gained may in this regard be used to host
        gatherings of coordinators from other clusters and dispatch experienced
        individuals to other clusters to work with local friends in the field.
        This is an approach to disseminating learning that has worked well with
        learning sites for the junior youth programme, and it is now being
        applied in some form in the context of groups of adjoining clusters that
        are organized around one or more which can offer

        Further, some institutes are also capturing lessons learned by creating
        documents that serve as dynamic records of efforts to address some key
        questions. With some of the knowledge generated globally about learning
        as a mode of operation now presented in Book 10, it is hoped that the

        emerge and evolve as a cluster advances. The overriding concern, of
        course, is ensuring that at every stage, a cluster is served by an
        appropriate arrangement and that capacity for coordination keeps pace
        with growth in activity. This requires that there is at the regional or

        assigned to assist the friends. In others, a few local friends who are
        showing capacity to assist are accompanying those who have initiated
        core activities. In still others, coordinators are formally named, while
        eventually, multiple coordinators working in teams, each with a few
        collaborators, are raised. A regular review of the organizational
        arrangements in clusters and groups of clusters across the country or
        region, and of the mechanisms in place to provide the necessary support,
        is an essential aspect of the responsibilities borne at the national or
        regional level.",

      "Structures at the national or regional level evolve to attend to these
      organizational needs of clusters. Periodic assessment should help those
      overseeing the institute’s work to determine in a timely manner when to
      reinforce or adjust whatever arrangement is in place. When to name a
      regional or national coordinator for each of the three educational
      activities; when, as activity increases, to appoint additional ones from
      among those gaining experience in clusters; how to build teams of friends
      at the regional level to help follow each programme; when to assign
      coordinators to work in parts of the region—are all matters that are
      progressively addressed. The latter point requires an additional comment.
      In large regions where regional coordinators are assigned to follow a
      number of clusters or even groups of adjoining clusters, they are
      increasingly operating at the level of a sub-region. As a consequence, a
      distinct administrative role at the regional level is emerging, and in
      some cases an individual is engaged to support the coordinators operating
      at the sub-regional level by managing funds, distributing materials,
      collating statistics, and organizing reflection gatherings.",

      title: 'Enhancing the Capacity of the Institute Itself',
      "As more and more clusters advance and the work of the institute increases
      in complexity, well-defined measures are introduced to help cluster and
      regional or national coordinators to grow in capability, heightening their
      knowledge of the Faith, their understanding of the Plan’s overarching
      conceptual framework, and their appreciation of the nature and purpose of
      the institute process. Their ability to explore the reality of their
      region or country, to assess progress, and to plan effectively can be
      enhanced, and certain practical abilities such as using statistical
      information in reflection and planning and managing judiciously the funds
      of the Faith can be developed. Capacities such as building environments of
      cooperation and unity are also cultivated. Some of these capacities are
      acquired naturally through experience as coordinators are assisted to
      carry out their work. Institutes identify other practical means to help
      coordinators develop necessary abilities. For instance, individuals with
      relevant experience can help others; at times the institute can draw on
      other educational programmes of the Faith such as those offered by
      Bahá’í-inspired agencies; and in some cases, coordinators and others
      serving the institute full-time have been supported to attend relevant

      individuals with specialized skills who are involved in the general
      community-building work of the Faith. Examples of such skills include
      translating educational materials, managing finances, and documenting
      learning. Through ongoing assessment of the institute’s evolving human
      resource needs and review of the measures in place to raise the capacity

      effective channels for the flow of funds from the national or regional to

      arrangements for maintaining accurate accounts are made. Awareness that
      the resources of the friends and the funds of the Faith are precious and

          desire to contribute to the betterment of society, and some among them
          dedicate a substantial amount of their time to the work of the
          institute. From among those serving as coordinators, some might
          require financial assistance for a period of time. There are a number
          of principles to be considered by institutes in this regard. Of
          course, capacity for coordination cannot be built by simply
          multiplying the number of coordinators serving full time and receiving
          remuneration. At the cluster level, the remuneration offered to some
          coordinators is essentially a short-term arrangement that is arrived
          at through conversation with each individual being invited to serve in
          this manner and requiring such assistance. Based on determined needs,

          While decisions made will differ from one person to another, the
          system will reflect an overall consistency. Additional considerations
          may be necessary at the regional or national level. Some of the
          friends serving full time and receiving remuneration might, for
          instance, need to continue receiving such assistance for an extended
          period in order to ensure that the learning processes across the

          A realistic range of remuneration can be established. In creating a
          framework for offering remuneration to the friends, a National
          Spiritual Assembly, in consultation with the Counsellors and the
          institute board, determines what would, in general, constitute a
