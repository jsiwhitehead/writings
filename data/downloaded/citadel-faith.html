                        Shrines, are estimated at thirty-five thousand pounds. Bahá’í literature has been
                        disseminated as far north as Upernavik, Greenland, above the Arctic Circle. The Bahá’í
                        message has been broadcast by radio as far south as Magallanes. The area of land dedicated
                        to the Ma<u>sh</u>riqu’l-A<u>dh</u>kár of Persia has increased by almost a quarter-million square meters. The number
                        of localities in the Antipodes where Bahá’ís reside has been raised to thirty-five,
                        spread over Australia, New Zealand and Tasmania. Twenty-seven assemblies are functioning
                        in Latin America. In over a hundred localities Bahá’ís are resident in Central and
                        South America, almost double the localities at opening of the first Seven Year Plan.
                        Historic Latin American conferences have been held in Buenos Aires and Panama. Summer
                        schools are established in Argentina and Chile. Land has been offered in Chile for
                        site of the first Ma<u>sh</u>riqu’l-A<u>dh</u>kár of Latin America. Additional assemblies have been incorporated in Paraguay and
                        Colombia. Seven others are in process of incorporation. A notable impetus has been
                        lent this world-redeeming Message through the concerted measures devised by the American
                        National Assembly designed to proclaim the Faith to the masses through public conferences,
                        press and radio.

                        and Heroic Age of our Faith, fell into three distinct epochs, of nine, of thirty-nine
                        and of twenty-nine years’ duration, associated respectively with the Bábí Dispensation
                        and the ministries of Bahá’u’lláh and of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. This Primitive Age of the Bahá’í
                        Era, unapproached in spiritual fecundity by any period associated with the mission
                        of the Founder of any previous Dispensation, was impregnated, from its inception to
                        its termination, with the creative energies generated through the advent of two independent
                        Manifestations and the establishment of a Covenant unique in the spiritual annals
                        of mankind.

                        the second, the Iron and Formative, Age of the Dispensation of Bahá’u’lláh—the first
                        of a series of epochs which must precede the inception of the last and Golden Age
                        of that Dispensation—a Dispensation which, as the Author of the Faith has Himself
                        categorically asserted, must extend over a period of no less than one thousand years,
                        and which will constitute the first stage in a series of Dispensations, to be established
                        by future Manifestations, all deriving their inspiration from the Author of the Bahá’í
                        Revelation, and destined to last, in their aggregate, no less than five thousand centuries.

                        The first epoch witnessed the birth and the primary stages in the erection of the
                        framework of the Administrative Order of the Faith—the nucleus and pattern of its
                        World Order—according to the precepts laid down in ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Will and Testament,
                        as well as the launching of the initial phase of the world-encompassing Plan bequeathed
                        by Him to the American Bahá’í Community. That epoch was characterized by a twofold
                        process aiming at the consolidation of the administrative structure of the Faith and
                        the extension of the range of its institutions. It witnessed on the one hand, the
                        emergence and the laying of the groundwork of that embryonic World Order whose advent
                        was announced by the Báb in the Bayán, whose laws were revealed by Bahá’u’lláh in
                        the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, and whose features were delineated by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in His Will
                        and Testament. It was marked on the other hand by the launching, in the Western Hemisphere,
                        of the first stage of a Plan whose original impulse was communicated by the Herald
                        of our Faith in His Qayyúmu’l-Asmá’, to whose implications the Author of the Bahá’í
                        Revelation alluded in His Tablets, and whose Charter was revealed by the Center of
                        His Covenant in the evening of His life.

                        this twofold process. It must witness, on the one hand, the consummation of a laboriously
                        constructed Administrative Order, and, on the other, the unfoldment of successive
                        stages in the development of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Plan beyond the confines of the Western
                        Hemisphere and of the continent of Europe.

                        will have been universally recognized, whilst in the course of the Golden Age, destined

                        our undivided attention during the opening years of this new epoch which we have entered.
                        The Second Seven Year Plan, intended to carry a stage further the mission conceived
                        by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá for the American Bahá’í Community, is now entering its second year,
                        and must, as it operates in three continents, be productive of results outshining
                        any as yet achieved since the Divine Plan itself was set in motion during the concluding
                        years of the first Bahá’í century. Unlike the plans which Bahá’í communities in Europe
                        and on the Asiatic continent have spontaneously inaugurated since the commencement
                        of the present century, the Plan with which the community of the “Apostles of Bahá’u’lláh”
                        stands identified is divine in origin, is guided by the explicit and repeated instructions
                        that have flowed from the pen of the Center of the Covenant Himself, is energized
                        by the all-compelling will of its Author, claims as the theater for its operation
                        territories spread over five continents and the islands of the seven seas, and must
                        continue to function, ere its purpose is achieved, throughout successive epochs in
                        the course of the Formative Age of the Bahá’í Dispensation. As it propels itself forward,
                        driven by forces which its prosecutors can not hope to properly assess, as it spreads
                        its ramifications to the furthest corners of the Western Hemisphere, and across the
                        oceans to the continents of the Old World, and beyond them to the far-flung islands
                        of the seas, this Plan, the birthright of the North American Bahá’í Community, will
                        be increasingly regarded as an agency designed not only for the enlargement of the
                        limits of the Faith and the multiplication of its institutions over the face of the
                        planet, but for the acceleration of the construction and completion of the administrative
                        framework of Bahá’u’lláh’s embryonic World Order, hastening thereby the advent of
                        that Golden Age which must witness the proclamation of the Most Great Peace and the
                        unfoldment of that world civilization which is the offspring and primary purpose of
                        that Peace.

                        be strenuously and unfalteringly pursued. The second year of the Second Seven Year
                        Plan must witness, on all fronts, on the part of young and old alike, rich and poor,
                        colored and white, neophyte and veteran, a rededication to the tasks undertaken and
                        an intensification of effort for their furtherance wholly unparalleled in the annals
                        of American Bahá’í history. In every state of the United States, in every province
                        of the Dominion of Canada, in every republic of Central and South America, in each
                        of the ten selected sovereign states of the European continent, the ever-swelling

                        launched on the second stage of their world-wide crusade, deriving fresh courage from
                        the exploits that have distinguished the opening phase of the present stage of their
                        enterprise, must strain every nerve to scale loftier heights of heroism, and deploy,
                        over a wider range, their divinely sustained forces, as their present Plan unfolds
                        and moves towards a climax.

                        as a direct result of the operation of the first Seven Year Plan, the Faith has established
                        its spiritual assemblies, the Canadian believers, as a token of their recognition
                        of the significance of the forthcoming formation of their first National Spiritual

                        homeland. Irrespective of the smallness of their numbers, notwithstanding the vastness
                        of the territory for which they have been made responsible, and as a sign of their
                        appreciation of the great bounty and independent status soon to be conferred upon
                        them, they must, unitedly, exert a supreme effort to enlarge the limits, multiply
                        the administrative centers, consolidate the institutions, and broadcast the truths
                        and essentials of their beloved Faith throughout the length and breadth of that immense

                        and fortified. The fifty-six localities where Bahá’ís reside should receive immediate
                        attention, and the most promising among them should be chosen for the establishment
                        of future assemblies, in order to broaden the basis and reinforce the foundations
                        of the future pillar of the Universal House of Justice. Particular attention should,
                        moreover, be paid to the need for the establishment, without delay, of the first Canadian
                        Bahá’í summer school, which, as the scope of the activities of the Canadian believers
                        extends, will have to be gradually supplemented by other institutions of a similar
                        character, as has been the case in the development of summer schools in the United
                        States of America. Preliminary steps should, likewise, be taken for the incorporation
                        of all firmly grounded spiritual assemblies, as a prelude to the establishment of
                        local and national endowments. The institution of the local Fund, in every center
                        where the administrative structure of the Faith has been erected, should be assiduously
                        developed. The holding of conferences designed to foster the unity, the solidarity
                        and harmonious development of the Canadian Bahá’í Community should be steadily encouraged.
                        An organized attempt should be made to broadcast the Message to the masses and their
                        leaders through the medium of the press and radio. A deliberate and sustained endeavor
                        should be exerted to win fresh recruits for the Faith from the ranks of the considerable
                        French-speaking population of that dominion. The greatest care should be exercised
                        to attract the attention, and win the support of other minorities in that land, such
                        as the Indians, the Eskimos, the Dukhobors and the Negroes, thereby reinforcing the
                        representative character of a rapidly developing community.

                        in a number of settlements and outposts beyond the Arctic Circle, and in dispatching
                        Bahá’í books to Godthaab, its capital, and as far north as Upernavik on Baffin Bay,
                        constitutes a modest yet historic beginning which the Canadian believers, in the light
                        of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Tablets addressed to them, must follow up in the years to come.

                        the events connected with it infinitely glorious. It shall become the object of the
                        glance of Providence, and shall show forth the bounties of the All-Glorious.” “Again
                        I repeat,” He, in that same Tablet affirms, “that the future of Canada is very great,
                        whether from a material or a spiritual standpoint.… The clouds of the Kingdom will
                        water the seeds of guidance which have been sown there.”

                        the pioneer field, who, as the mighty task progresses, must increasingly bear the
                        brunt of responsibility for the propagation of the Faith in their homelands. Full
                        advantage should be taken of the facilities provided by the use of practical workshop
                        courses in Latin American pioneering at the International School at Temerity Ranch.
                        The two summer schools in Azeiza and Santiago, as well as one planned in Vera Cruz,
                        should be utilized, not only as centers for the acquisition of Bahá’í learning, but
                        as training grounds for pioneering among the Spanish and Portuguese speaking populations
                        of all the republics of Latin America. The regional conferences held in Buenos Aires
                        and Panama should be followed by conferences of a similar character, at which a growing
                        number of attendants from among the ranks of Latin American believers will assume
                        an ever-increasing share of responsibility in the initiation and conduct of the affairs
                        of a continually evolving community. A deliberate effort should be made to increase,
                        through correspondence teaching and its extension to all the Spanish speaking countries,
                        the number of the active supporters of the Faith, so desperately needed in view of
                        the vastness of the field, the mighty responsibilities that have been incurred, the
                        smallness of the number of laborers, and the shortness of the time at their disposal.

                        of accurate and improved radio scripts, the extension of teaching projects through
                        regional teaching committees, visual education and the organization of public meetings,
                        should be fully utilized to capture the attention, win the sympathy, and secure the
                        active and unreserved support of a steadily increasing proportion of the population
                        of the various Latin American republics. The publishing activities of a constantly
                        growing community should, likewise, be stimulated, their scope should be continually
                        widened, the quality of Bahá’í publications in Spanish, Portuguese and French be improved,
                        and their dissemination over a wide area be insured. The two Spanish bulletins, the
                        one already published in Santiago and the other planned in San José, should, likewise,
                        as an adjunct to Bahá’í publications, be developed and widely circulated. The contact
                        established with the two hundred and forty-four Masonic Lodges should be reinforced
                        by similar contacts with schools as well as business firms established throughout
                        the various republics, for the sole purpose of giving further publicity to the Faith,
                        and winning ultimately fresh recruits to the strength of its followers.

                        Indian tribes, the aboriginal inhabitants of the Latin republics, whom the Author
                        of the Tablets of the Divine Plan has compared to the “ancient inhabitants of the
                        Arabian Peninsula.” “Attach great importance,” is His admonition to the entire body
                        of the believers in the United States and the Dominion of Canada, “to the indigenous
                        population of America. For these souls may be likened unto the ancient inhabitants
                        of the Arabian Peninsula, who, prior to the Mission of Muḥammad, were like unto savages.
                        When the light of Muḥammad shone forth in their midst, however, they became so radiant
                        as to illumine the world. Likewise, these Indians, should they be educated and guided,
                        there can be no doubt that they will become so illumined as to enlighten the whole
                        world.” The initial contact already established, in the concluding years of the first
                        Bahá’í century, in obedience to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Mandate, with the Cherokee and Oneida
                        Indians in North Carolina and Wisconsin, with the Patagonian, the Mexican and the
                        Inca Indians, and the Mayans in Argentina, Mexico, Peru and Yucatan, respectively,
                        should, as the Latin American Bahá’í communities gain in stature and strength, be
                        consolidated and extended. A special effort should be exerted to secure the unqualified
                        adherence of members of some of these tribes to the Faith, their subsequent election
                        to its councils, and their unreserved support of the organized attempts that will
                        have to be made in the future by the projected national assemblies for the large-scale
                        conversion of Indian races to the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh.

                        ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, referring to the Central American republics in one of the Tablets of
                        His Divine Plan, has affirmed, “have importance, but especially the Republic of Panama,
                        wherein the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans come together through the Panama Canal. It
                        is a center for travel and passage from America to other continents of the world,
                        and in the future it will gain most great importance.” “Likewise,” He moreover has
                        written, “ye must give great attention to the Republic of Panama, for in that point
                        the Occident and the Orient find each other united through the Panama Canal, and it
                        is also situated between the two great oceans. That place will become very important
                        in the future. The teachings, once established there, will unite the East and the

                        be developed with assiduous care and unfailing patience. Furthermore, the strengthening

                        the course of the second stage in the development of the Divine Plan. The assembly

                        and its potentialities unfathomable. Its hazards, rigors and pitfalls are numerous,
                        its field immense, the number of its promoters as yet utterly inadequate, the resources
                        required for its effective prosecution barely tapped. The races, nations and classes
                        included within its orbit are numerous and highly diversified, and the prizes to be
                        won by its victors incalculably great. The hatreds that inflame, the rivalries that
                        agitate, the controversies that confuse, the miseries that afflict, these races, nations
                        and classes are bitter and of long standing. The influence and fanaticism, whether
                        ecclesiastical or political, of potentially hostile organizations, firmly entrenched
                        within their ancestral strongholds, are formidable.

                        <a id="721828548" class="brl-location"></a>The members of the North American Bahá’í Community, to whose care the immediate destinies
                        of this fate-laden crusade have been entrusted, are standing at a new crossroads.
                        Behind them is an imperishable record, brief yet illustrious, of feats performed over
                        the entire range of the Western Hemisphere. Before them stretches a vista alluring
                        in its as yet hazy outlines, entrancing in its magnitude, reaching to the far horizons
                        of as yet unconquered territories. They can look back, since that crusade was launched,
                        upon a decade of modest beginnings, of toilsome labors, of richly deserved rewards.
                        They now look forward to successive epochs reaching as far as the fringes of that
                        Golden Age that is to be, glowing in the light of God-given promises, destined to
                        be traversed at the cost of infinite toil and of heroic self-sacrifice.

                        sands are running out, the short span of six brief years intervening between the present
                        hour and the termination of the second stage of the enterprise on which they have
                        embarked will soon expire. The hosts on high, having sounded the signal, are impatient
                        to rush forward, and demonstrate anew the irresistible force of their might. Europe,
                        in the throes of the aftermath of a horribly devastating conflict, calls desperately,
                        in one of the darkest hours of its history, for that sovereign remedy which only the
                        Plan, conceived by a divinely appointed Physician, can administer. Sister communities,
                        in the north and in the heart of that continent, alive to the needs, the opportunities
                        and the glorious mission of the vanguard of Bahá’u’lláh’s crusaders, now landing on
                        the shores of that agitated continent, are only too eager to reinforce the stupendous
                        exertions that must needs be made for its ultimate redemption. Nor will other sister
                        communities further afield refrain, for a moment, from lending a helping hand, once
                        the progress of this gigantic movement now set in motion is accelerated. Above and
                        beyond them all, unsleeping, ever-solicitous, unerring, is the Pilot of their bark,
                        the Charterer of their course, the Founder of their spiritual fellowship, the Bestower
                        of that primacy which is the hallmark of their destiny.

                        must, in the years immediately ahead, be exhibited, and in whose capitals the foundations
                        of the embryonic Order of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh must preferably be unassailably
                        laid, must each evolve into strongholds from which the dynamic energies of that Faith
                        can be diffused to neighboring territories in the course of the unfoldment of the
                        Plan. The nuclei that are now being formed, and the groups that are beginning to emerge,
                        must be speedily and systematically reinforced, not only through the dispatch and
                        settlement of pioneers and the visits paid them by itinerant teachers, but also through
                        the progressive development of the teaching work which the pioneers themselves must
                        initiate and foster among the native population in those countries. Any artificially
                        created assembly, consisting of settlers from abroad, can at best be considered as
                        temporary and insecure, and should, if the second stage of the European enterprise
                        is to be commenced without undue delay in the future, be supplanted by broad-based,
                        securely grounded, efficiently functioning assemblies, composed primarily of the people
                        of the countries themselves, who are firm in faith, unimpeachable in their loyalty
                        and whole-hearted in their support of the Administrative Order of the Faith. The twenty-five
                        pioneers that have already proceeded to Scandinavia and the Low Countries, to the
                        Iberian Peninsula, to Switzerland and Italy, should, in the course of this current
                        year, and while the process of teaching the native population is being inaugurated,
                        be reinforced by as many additional pioneers as possible, and particularly by those
                        who, possessed of independent means, can, either themselves or through their appointed
                        deputies, swell the number of the valiant workers already laboring with such devotion
                        in those fields.

                        and famous libraries established in those countries. No time should be lost in establishing,

                        embrace its truth. Particular attention should, moreover, be paid to attendance at
                        congresses and conferences, and to any contacts that can be made with colleges and
                        universities which offer a fertile field for the scattering of the seeds of the Faith,

                        such links with these institutions as will not only assist them in the discharge of
                        their duties, but enable them to initiate, when the time is ripe, an institution of
                        a similar character, under the auspices of the European Teaching Committee—an institution
                        which will be the forerunner of the summer schools that will have to be founded separately
                        by the future assemblies in their respective countries. Above all, any assistance

                        and their auxiliary committees, and particularly their publishing agencies, can extend

                        organized body of the “apostles of Bahá’u’lláh,” destined to unfold its potentialities
                        in the course of succeeding centuries, and bidding fair to eclipse the radiance of
                        those past ages which have successfully witnessed the introduction of the Christian
                        Faith into the continent’s northern climes, the efflorescence of Islamic culture that
                        shed such radiance along its southern shores, and the rise of the Reformation in its
                        very heart.

                        <a id="685827952" class="brl-location"></a>The stage is set. The hour is propitious. The signal is sounded. Bahá’u’lláh’s spiritual
                        battalions are moving into position. The initial clash between the forces of darkness
                        and the army of light, as unnoticed as the landing, two milleniums ago, of the apostles
                        of Christ on the southern shores of the European continent, is being registered by
                        the denizens of the Abhá Kingdom. The Author of the Plan that has set so titanic an
                        enterprise in motion is Himself mounted at the head of these battalions, and leads
                        them on to capture the cities of men’s hearts. A continent, twice blessed by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s
                        successive visits to its shores, and the scene of His first public appearance in the
                        West; which has been the cradle of a civilization to some of whose beneficent features
                        the pen of Bahá’u’lláh has paid significant tribute; on whose soil both the Greek
                        and Roman civilizations were born and flourished; which has contributed so richly
                        to the unfoldment of American civilization; the fountainhead of American culture;
                        the mother of Christendom, and the scene of the greatest exploits of the followers
                        of Jesus Christ; in some of whose outlying territories have been won some of the most
                        resplendent victories which ushered in the Golden Age of Islám; which sustained, in
                        its very heart, the violent impact of the onrushing hosts of that Faith, intent on
                        the subjugation of its cities, but which refused to bend the knee to its invaders,
                        and succeeded in the end in repulsing their assault—such a continent is now experiencing,
                        at the hands of the little as yet unnoticed band of pioneers sent forth by the enviable,
                        the privileged, the dynamic American Bahá’í Community, the first stirrings of that
                        spiritual revolution which must culminate, in the Golden Age that is as yet unborn,
                        in the permanent establishment of Bahá’u’lláh’s Order throughout that continent.

                        addressed, to whose care the destinies of so prodigious an enterprise have been committed,
                        and of whom such titanic efforts are now demanded. I can do no better than recall,
                        nor can I sufficiently emphasize, or refrain from quoting anew, those stirring and
                        pregnant passages that illuminate the pages of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s epoch-making Tablets.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="355520811" class="brl-location"></a>In one of these Tablets, addressed to the believers in the Northeastern States, these
                        weighty and highly significant words are recorded: “All countries, in the estimation
                        of the one true God, are but one country, and all cities and villages are on an equal
                        footing… Through faith and certitude, and the precedence achieved by one over another,
                        however, the dweller conferreth honor upon the dwelling, some of the countries achieve
                        distinction, and attain a preeminent position. For instance, notwithstanding that
                        some of the countries of Europe and of America are distinguished by, and surpass other
                        countries in, the salubrity of their climate, the wholesomeness of their water, and
                        the charm of their mountains, plains and prairies, yet Palestine became the glory
                        of all nations inasmuch as all the holy and Divine Manifestations, from the time of
                        Abraham until the appearance of the Seal of the Prophets (Muḥammad), have lived in,
                        or migrated to, or traveled through, that country. Likewise, Mecca and Medina have
                        achieved illimitable glory, as the light of Prophethood shone forth therein. For this
                        reason Palestine and Ḥijáz have been distinguished from all other countries.” “Likewise,”
                        is His remarkable disclosure, “the continent of America is, in the eyes of the one
                        true God, the land wherein the splendors of His light shall be revealed, where the
                        mysteries of His Faith shall be unveiled, the home of the righteous, and the gathering-place
                        of the free.”

                        <a id="366432570" class="brl-location"></a>To those of His followers, dwelling in that enviable and blessed continent, He has
                        chosen to address these no less inspiring words, as recorded in one of those Tablets
                        revealed in honor of the believers of the United States and Canada: “O ye apostles
                        of Bahá’u’lláh! May my life be sacrificed for you!… Behold the portals which Bahá’u’lláh
                        hath opened before you! Consider how exalted and lofty is the station you are destined
                        to attain, how unique the favors with which you have been endowed… My thoughts are
                        turned towards you, and my heart leaps within me at your mention. Could ye know how
                        my soul gloweth with your love, so great a happiness would flood your hearts as to
                        cause you to become enamored with each other.” “The full measure of your success,”
                        He, in another Tablet, addressed to the entire company of His followers in the North
                        American continent these prophetic words: “is as yet unrevealed, its significance
                        unapprehended. Erelong ye will with your own eyes witness how brilliantly every one
                        of you, even as a shining star, will radiate in the firmament of your country the
                        light of divine guidance, and will bestow upon its people the glory of an everlasting
                        life… I fervently hope that in the near future the whole earth may be stirred and
                        shaken by the results of your achievements. The hope which ‘Abdu’l-Bahá cherishes
                        for you is that the same success which has attended your efforts in America may crown
                        your endeavors in other parts of the world, that through you the fame of the Cause
                        of God may be diffused throughout the East and the West, and the advent of the Kingdom
                        of the Lord of Hosts be proclaimed in all the five continents of the globe. The moment
                        this Divine Message is carried forward by the American believers from the shores of
                        America, and is propagated through the continents of Europe, of Asia, of Africa and
                        of Australia, and as far as the islands of the Pacific, this community will find itself
                        securely established upon the throne of an everlasting dominion. Then will all the
                        peoples of the world witness that this community is spiritually illumined and divinely
                        guided. Then will the whole earth resound with the praises of its majesty and greatness…
                        Know ye of a certainty that whatever gathering ye enter, the waves of the Holy Spirit
                        are surging over it, and the heavenly grace of the Blessed Beauty encompasseth that
                        gathering… O that I could travel, even though on foot and in the utmost poverty, to
                        these regions, and, raising the call of Yá-Bahá’u’l-Abhá in cities, villages, mountains,
                        deserts and oceans promote the divine teachings! This, alas, I cannot do. How intensely
                        I deplore it! Please God, ye may achieve it… Thus far ye have been untiring in your
                        labors. Let your exertions henceforth increase a thousandfold. Summon the people in
                        these countries, capitals, islands, assemblies and churches to enter the Abhá Kingdom.
                        The scope of your exertions must needs be extended. The wider its range, the more
                        striking will be the evidence of divine assistance.”

                        statement in His writings: “In the East the light of His Revelation hath broken; in
                        the West have appeared the signs of His dominion. Ponder this in your hearts, O people,

                        and shed its radiance upon the West. The illumination thus shed hath, however, acquired
                        in the West an extraordinary brilliancy. Consider the Faith proclaimed by Jesus. Though
                        it first appeared in the East, yet not until its light had been shed upon the West
                        did the full measure of its potentialities become manifest.” “The day is approaching
                        when ye shall witness how, through the splendor of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh the West
                        will have replaced the East, radiating the light of divine guidance.” “The West hath
                        acquired illumination from the East, but, in some respects the reflection of the light
                        hath been greater in the Occident.” “The East hath, verily, been illumined with the
                        light of the Kingdom. Erelong will this same light shed a still greater illumination
                        through the potency of the teachings of God, and their souls be set aglow by the undying

                        and irresistibly advancing towards the goal destined for it by both Bahá’u’lláh and
                        ‘Abdu’l-Bahá? Indeed if we would read aright the signs of the times, and appraise
                        correctly the significances of contemporaneous events that are impelling forward both
                        the American Bahá’í Community and the nation of which it forms a part on the road
                        leading them to their ultimate destiny, we cannot fail to perceive the workings of
                        two simultaneous processes, generated as far back as the concluding years of the Heroic
                        Age of our Faith, each clearly defined, each distinctly separate, yet closely related
                        and destined to culminate, in the fullness of time, in a single glorious consummation.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="898953818" class="brl-location"></a>One of these processes is associated with the mission of the American Bahá’í Community,
                        the other with the destiny of the American nation. The one serves directly the interests
                        of the Administrative Order of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh, the other promotes indirectly
                        the institutions that are to be associated with the establishment of His World Order.
                        The first process dates back to the revelation of those stupendous Tablets constituting
                        the Charter of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Divine Plan. It was held in abeyance for well-nigh twenty
                        years while the fabric of an indispensable Administrative Order, designed as a divinely
                        appointed agency for the operation of that Plan, was being constructed. It registered
                        its initial success with the triumphant conclusion of the first stage of its operation
                        in the republics of the Western Hemisphere. It signalized the opening of the second
                        phase of its development through the inauguration of the present teaching campaign
                        in the European continent. It must pass into the third stage of its evolution with
                        the initiation of the third Seven Year Plan, designed to culminate in the establishment
                        of the structure of the Administrative Order in all the remaining sovereign states
                        and chief dependencies of the globe. It must reach the end of the first epoch in its
                        evolution with the fulfillment of the prophecy mentioned by Daniel in the last chapter
                        of His Book, related to the year 1335, and associated by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá with the world
                        triumph of the Faith of His Father. It will be consummated through the emergence of
                        the Bahá’í World Commonwealth in the Golden Age of the Bahá’í Dispensation.

                        <a id="533445361" class="brl-location"></a>The other process dates back to the outbreak of the first World War that threw the
                        great republic of the West into the vortex of the first stage of a world upheaval.
                        It received its initial impetus through the formulation of President Wilson’s Fourteen
                        Points, closely associating for the first time that republic with the fortunes of
                        the Old World. It suffered its first setback through the dissociation of that republic
                        from the newly born League of Nations which that president had labored to create.
                        It acquired added momentum through the outbreak of the second World War, inflicting
                        unprecedented suffering on that republic, and involving it still further in the affairs
                        of all the continents of the globe. It was further reinforced through the declaration
                        embodied in the Atlantic Charter, as voiced by one of its chief progenitors, Franklin
                        D. Roosevelt. It assumed a definite outline through the birth of the United Nations
                        at the San Francisco Conference. It acquired added significance through the choice
                        of the City of the Covenant itself as the seat of the newly born organization, through
                        the declaration recently made by the American president related to his country’s commitments
                        in Greece and Turkey, as well as through the submission to the General Assembly of
                        the United Nations of the thorny and challenging problem of the Holy Land, the spiritual
                        as well as the administrative center of the World Faith of Bahá’u’lláh. It must, however
                        long and tortuous the way, lead, through a series of victories and reverses, to the
                        political unification of the Eastern and Western Hemispheres, to the emergence of
                        a world government and the establishment of the Lesser Peace, as foretold by Bahá’u’lláh
                        and foreshadowed by the Prophet Isaiah. It must, in the end, culminate in the unfurling
                        of the banner of the Most Great Peace, in the Golden Age of the Dispensation of Bahá’u’lláh.

                        <a id="990358072" class="brl-location"></a>Might not a still closer parallel be drawn between the community singled out for the
                        execution of this world-embracing Plan, in its relation to its sister communities,
                        and the nation of which it forms a part, in its relation to its sister nations? On
                        the one hand is a community which ever since its birth has been nursed in the lap
                        of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and been lovingly trained by Him through the revelation of unnumbered
                        Tablets, through the dispatch of special and successive messengers, and through His
                        own prolonged visit to the North American continent in the evening of His life. It
                        was to the members of this community, the spiritual descendants of the dawn-breakers
                        of the Heroic Age of our Faith, that He, whilst sojourning in the City of the Covenant,
                        chose to reveal the implications of that Covenant. It was in the vicinity of this
                        community’s earliest established center that He laid, with His own hands, the cornerstone
                        of the first Ma<u>sh</u>riqu’l-A<u>dh</u>kár of the western world. It was to the members of this community that He subsequently
                        addressed His Tablets of the Divine Plan, investing it with a spiritual primacy, and
                        singling it out for a glorious mission among its sister communities. It was this community
                        which won the immortal honor of being the first to introduce the Faith in the British
                        Isles, in France and in Germany, and which sent forth its consecrated pioneers and
                        teachers to China, Japan and India, to Australia and New Zealand, to the Balkan Peninsula,
                        to South Africa, to Latin America, to the Baltic States, to Scandinavia and the islands
                        of the Pacific, hoisting thereby its banner in the vast majority of the countries
                        won over to its cause, in both the East and the West, prior to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s passing.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="238822309" class="brl-location"></a>It was this community, the cradle and stronghold of the Administrative Order of the
                        Faith of Bahá’u’lláh, which, on the morrow of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s ascension, was the first
                        among all other Bahá’í communities in East and West to arise and champion the cause
                        of that Order, to fix its pattern, to erect its fabric, to initiate its endowments,
                        to establish and consolidate its subsidiary institutions, and to vindicate its aims
                        and purposes. To it belongs the unique distinction of having erected, in the heart
                        of the North American continent, the first Ma<u>sh</u>riqu’l-A<u>dh</u>kár of the West, the holiest edifice ever to be reared by the hands of the followers
                        of Bahá’u’lláh in either the Eastern or Western Hemisphere. It was through the assiduous
                        and unflagging labors of the most distinguished and consecrated among its itinerant
                        teachers that the allegiance of royalty to the Cause of Bahá’u’lláh was won, and unequivocally
                        proclaimed in successive testimonies as penned by the royal convert herself. To its
                        members, the vanguard of the torchbearers of the future world civilization, must,
                        moreover, be ascribed the imperishable glory of having launched and successfully concluded
                        the first stage of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Divine Plan, in the concluding years of the first
                        Bahá’í century, establishing thereby the structural basis of the Administrative Order
                        of the Faith in all the republics of Central and South America. It is this same community
                        which is once again carrying off the palm of victory through launching, in the first
                        decade of the second century of the Bahá’í Era, the second stage of that same Plan,
                        destined to lay the foundations of the Bahá’í Administrative Order in no less than
                        ten sovereign states in the continent of Europe, comprising the Scandinavian states,
                        the Low Countries, the states of the Iberian Peninsula, Switzerland and Italy. And
                        lastly, to its enterprising members must go the unique honor and privilege of having
                        arisen, on unnumbered occasions, and over a period of more than a quarter of a century,
                        to champion the cause of the down-trodden and persecuted among their brethren in Persia,
                        in Egypt, in Russia, in ‘Iráq and in Germany, to stretch a generous helping hand to
                        the needy among them, to defend and safeguard the interests of their institutions,
                        and to plead their cause before political and ecclesiastical adversaries.

                        <a id="580736086" class="brl-location"></a>On the other hand is a nation that has achieved undisputed ascendancy in the entire
                        Western Hemisphere, whose rulers have been uniquely honored by being collectively
                        addressed by the Author of the Bahá’í Revelation in His Kitáb-i-Aqdas; which has been
                        acclaimed by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá as the “home of the righteous and the gathering-place of
                        the free,” where the “splendors of His light shall be revealed, where the mysteries
                        of His Faith shall be unveiled” and belonging to a continent which, as recorded by
                        that same pen, “giveth signs and evidences of very great advancement,” whose “future
                        is even more promising,” whose “influence and illumination are far-reaching,” and
                        which “will lead all nations spiritually.” Moreover, it is to this great republic
                        of the West that the Center of the Covenant of Bahá’u’lláh has referred as the nation
                        that has “developed powers and capacities greater and more wonderful than other nations,”
                        and which “is equipped and empowered to accomplish that which will adorn the pages
                        of history, to become the envy of the world, and be blest in both the East and the
                        West for the triumph of its people.” It is for this same American democracy that He
                        expressed His fervent hope that it might be “the first nation to establish the foundation
                        of international agreement,” “to proclaim the unity of mankind,” and “to unfurl the
                        Standard of the Most Great Peace,” that it might become “the distributing center of
                        spiritual enlightenment, and all the world receive this heavenly blessing,” and that
                        its inhabitants might “rise from their present material attainments to such a height
                        that heavenly illumination may stream from this center to all the peoples of the world.”
                        It is in connection with its people that He has affirmed that they are “indeed worthy
                        of being the first to build the Tabernacle of the Great Peace and proclaim the oneness
                        of mankind.”

                        ordeal it has yet suffered, and the attendant tribulations and commotions which a
                        travailing age must necessarily experience, as a prelude to the birth of the new World
                        Order, destined to rise upon the ruins of a tottering civilization, must, as they
                        intensify, increasingly influence the course, and, in some cases, retard the progress,
                        of the collective enterprises successively launched in the opening years of the second
                        Bahá’í century, and in almost every continent of the globe, by the world-wide community
                        of the organized followers of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh. In the land of its birth long-standing
                        political rivalries, combined with a steady decline in the authority and influence
                        exercised by the central government, are contributing to the reemergence of reactionary
                        forces, represented by an as yet influential and fanatical priesthood, to a recrudescence
                        of the persecution, and a multiplication of the disabilities, to which a still unemancipated
                        Faith has been so cruelly subjected for more than a century. In the heart of the continent
                        of Europe, still fiercer political rivalries, as well as the clash of conflicting
                        ideologies, have prevented the unification, indefinitely retarded the national revival,
                        multiplied the vicissitudes and rendered more desperate the plight, of a nation comprising
                        within its frontiers the largest community of the adherents of the Faith on that continent—a
                        community destined, as prophesied by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, to play a major role in the spiritual
                        awakening and the ultimate conversion of the European peoples and races to His Father’s
                        Faith. In the subcontinent of India recent political developments of a momentous character
                        have plunged its divers castes, races and denominations into grave turmoil, brought
                        in their wake riots, bloodshed, misery and confusion, fanned into flame religious
                        animosities, and well-nigh disrupted its economic life. In the Nile Valley the outbreak
                        of a widespread and virulent epidemic, following closely upon the political unrest
                        and the severe economic crisis already afflicting its inhabitants, threatens to disorganize
                        the life of the nation and to bring in its wake afflictions of an even more serious
                        character. In the Holy Land itself, the heart and nerve-center of the far-flung and
                        firmly knit community of the followers of Bahá’u’lláh, and the repository of its holiest
                        shrines, already gravely disturbed by the chronic instability of its political life,
                        the religious dissensions of its inhabitants, and the ten-year-long strain and danger
                        to which its people have been subjected and exposed, fresh perils are looming on its
                        horizon, menacing it, on the one hand with the ravages of an epidemic that has already
                        taken so heavy a toll of the lives of the people beyond its southern frontier, and
                        threatening it, on the other, with a civil war of extreme severity and unpredictable
                        in its consequences. Subject to the same fundamental causes which have deranged the
                        equilibrium of present-day society and corroded its life are to be regarded the privations,
                        the restrictions and crisis which, to a lesser degree, are oppressing the peoples
                        of Central and Southeastern Europe, of the British Isles and of certain republics
                        of Central and South America.

                        truly heart-warming and evokes intense admiration. The broad outlines of the primary

                        and in its very heart. In the Latin American field, where the structural basis of
                        a rising Administrative Order has already been established, through the formation
                        of firmly grounded assemblies in each of the republics of Central and South America,

                        and its needs simultaneously and vigorously fulfilled. The allurements of the glorious
                        adventure in the Latin American field, the glittering prizes already won and the new
                        ones within reach, must, at no time, obscure the issues, or retard the task confronting
                        the prosecutors of the Plan in their homeland, or allow the interests of its assemblies,
                        for the most part new and struggling, to be either neglected or forgotten. Nor must
                        the glamor of the still more recent and glorious adventure embarked upon across the
                        Atlantic, within a turbulent, politically convulsed, economically disrupted and spiritually
                        depleted continent, dim, in however small a measure, the radiance, or detract from
                        the urgency, of the magnificent enterprises, whose first fruits in Latin America are
                        only beginning to mature, in direct consequence of the initial operation of the Plan
                        bequeathed by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá to the American believers. 
                     </p>

                        <a id="864988857" class="brl-location"></a>To the vital requirements of this Plan, at so critical a juncture, both in the fortunes
                        of mankind in general, and of the Plan itself, to which detailed reference has been
                        made in a previous communication, I need not again refer. All I desire to emphasize
                        is my fervent plea, addressed to both the administrators who, as the elected representatives
                        of the community must devise the plans, coordinate the activities, and direct the
                        agencies of a continually expanding community, and to those whose privilege it is
                        to labor, at home and abroad, to insure the effective prosecution of these sacred
                        tasks, to realize the propitiousness of the present hour, recognize its urgency, meet
                        its challenge and appreciate its unique potentialities. As the international situation
                        worsens, as the fortunes of mankind sink to a still lower ebb, the momentum of the
                        Plan must be further accelerated, and the concerted exertions of the community responsible
                        for its execution rise to still higher levels of consecration and heroism. As the
                        fabric of present-day society heaves and cracks under the strain and stress of portentous
                        events and calamities, as the fissures, accentuating the cleavage separating nation
                        from nation, class from class, race from race, and creed from creed, multiply, the
                        prosecutors of the Plan must evince a still greater cohesion in their spiritual lives
                        and administrative activities, and demonstrate a higher standard of concerted effort,
                        of mutual assistance, and of harmonious development in their collective enterprises.
                     </p>

                        <a id="510960122" class="brl-location"></a>Then, and only then, will the reaction to the stupendous forces, released through
                        the operation of a divinely conceived, divinely impelled Plan, be made apparent, and
                        the fairest fruit of the weightiest spiritual enterprise launched in recorded history
                        under the aegis of the Center of the Covenant of Bahá’u’lláh be garnered.

                        approaching time limit fixed for attainment of the goal of one hundred seventy-five
                        assemblies, emergency measures carefully, promptly devised by national representatives

                        multiply their number, are imperative. The placing of further contract for Temple,
                        the reinforcement of basis of forthcoming Canadian National Spiritual Assembly, the
                        additional consolidation of the institutions of the Faith in Latin America, the wider

                        aspect of an otherwise successfully conducted Plan. I address this last-minute appeal
                        to every single member of the community, the champion warriors in the army of Bahá’u’lláh,
                        which since launching the Plan formulated by the Center of His Covenant never succumbed
                        to defeat nor was thwarted in its purpose, to arise resolutely, volunteer instantly
                        to fill the gap in the main defenses of the home front and register total victory
                        ere the termination of the second year of the Second Seven Year Plan. Fervently praying

                        <a id="181457449" class="brl-location"></a>The gravity of the emergency facing the North American believers is unprecedented
                        since the initiation of the Divine Plan and unparalleled in the history of the American
                        Bahá’í Community since ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s passing. No obstacle is insuperable, no sacrifice
                        too great for attainment of supremely important objective. The eyes of her sister
                        communities in every continent of the globe and of her daughter communities of Latin
                        America, handicapped by a variety of adverse circumstances, are fixed upon the community
                        of followers of Bahá’u’lláh in North American continent who are enjoying the blessings
                        of internal peace, adequate resources, administrative experience and organizing ability
                        for their divinely appointed mission, expecting them to arise and avert the reverse
                        which would mar the splendor of their record of unexampled stewardship. I am moved
                        to plead, at this eleventh hour, that the rank and file of the community, particularly
                        the members resident in long-established leading strongholds of the Faith—New York,
                        Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Washington—issue forth unhesitatingly, determinedly,
                        sacrifice every interest, assume positions in the forefront of the struggle and emulate
                        in the course of the first decade of second Bahá’í century, opening years of the second
                        epoch of Formative Age of the Faith, exploits of their spiritual progenitors, the
                        dawn-breakers of the Heroic Age, which immortalized the dawn of the first Bahá’í century.
                        The immediate fortunes of the Plan are precariously hanging in the balance. The three
                        months’ interval is swiftly running out. My heart aches at contemplation of the possibility
                        of failure of the stalwart community to rise to the heights of the occasion. I refuse
                        to believe that its members, invested with unique apostolic mission of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá,
                        will shrink from meeting the most challenging requirement of the present hour.

                        will sweep its members on crest of the wave to total victory. I feel assured that

                        will win added commendation from its sister communities of the Eastern Hemisphere,

                        is estimated at over six hundred thousand pounds. National Bahá’í endowments on the
                        North American continent are valued at over two million dollars. The area of land
                        dedicated to the Ma<u>sh</u>riqu’l-A<u>dh</u>kár in Persia is approximately four million square meters. The value of the national
                        Hazíratu’l-Quds in the capitals of India and Persia respectively is six hundred thousand
                        rupees and fifty thousand pounds. The area of land dedicated to the first Ma<u>sh</u>riqu’l-A<u>dh</u>kár in South America is ninety thousand square meters. The number of pieces of Bahá’í
                        literature sold and distributed in the course of one year in North America is over
                        eighty thousand pieces. The record of the number of visitors to the Ma<u>sh</u>riqu’l-A<u>dh</u>kár in America in one year is over seventeen thousand and the total number of visitors
                        since its erection is over one quarter of a million. The number of states in the American
                        Union formally recognizing Bahá’í marriage certificates is now eight. The number of
                        national assemblies functioning in the Bahá’í world is raised to nine through the
                        formation of the first Canadian National Assembly, to be shortly reinforced through
                        the constitution of two additional assemblies in South and Central America and the
                        West Indies.

                        the acceleration of the twofold process designed to preserve the status of the present
                        assemblies throughout the states of the Union and multiply their number; the constant
                        broadening of the bases on which the projected Latin American national assemblies
                        are to be securely founded; the steady expansion of the work initiated to give wider
                        publicity to the Faith in the North American continent and in circles associated with
                        the United Nations; and, last but not least, the constitution of firmly established
                        assemblies in each of the remaining goal countries in Europe and the simultaneous
                        initiation, in the countries already provided with such assemblies, of measures aiming
                        at the formation of several nuclei calculated to reinforce the structural basis of
                        an infant Administrative Order—these stand out as the primary and inescapable duties
                        which the members of your Assembly—the mainspring of the multitudinous activities
                        carried on in your homeland, in the Latin American field, and on the European front—must
                        in this third year of the Second Seven Year Plan, befittingly discharge.

                        of the first two contracts for the completion of the Sepulcher of the Báb, as contemplated
                        by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, is indeed a phenomenon of singular significance. This conjunction

                        House of Worship in the American continent with the most hallowed Shrine on the slopes
                        of Mount Carmel, brings vividly to mind the no less remarkable coincidence marking
                        the simultaneous holding, on a Naw-Rúz Day, of the first convention of the American
                        Bahá’í Community and the entombment by the Center of Bahá’u’lláh’s Covenant of the

                        community which has so nobly responded to His summons addressed to the “peoples of

                        from the steps of His House on an August day in 1915, remarked to some of His companions,
                        at a time when the Báb’s remains had already been placed by Him in the vault of one
                        of the six chambers He had already constructed for that purpose. “God willing, it

                        design, at the prevention of the sale of land within the precincts of the Shrine itself,
                        and the multiplication of the measures taken for the preservation and consolidation

                        demonstrates that accomplishment of signal acts accompanied, or followed upon, periods
                        of acute distress in European and American contemporary history. The machinery of
                        the Administrative Order was established, and preliminary stage of construction of
                        the House of Worship was undertaken, by a grief-stricken community in the anxious
                        years following the sudden removal of its loving, watchful Founder. The superstructure
                        of the Temple was erected amid the strain and stress of an economic depression of
                        an unprecedented severity gripping the North American continent. The first Seven Year
                        Plan, opening stage in the execution of the historic mission entrusted to the American
                        Bahá’í Community, was launched in the face of a gathering storm culminating in the
                        direst conflict yet experienced by mankind. The Tablets of the Divine Plan were revealed
                        amidst the turmoil of the first World War involving great danger to the life of their
                        Author. The remains of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s mother and brother were transferred to site
                        of monuments constituting focus of institutions of future World Administrative Center
                        and erected on the morrow of the outbreak of hostilities while the Holy Land was increasingly
                        exposed to the perils precipitated by the second conflict. The daughter communities
                        of Latin America were called into being and exterior ornamentation of the Temple was
                        consummated while the American mother community was in the throes of the last, most
                        harassing stage of the devastating struggle. The world-wide Centenary celebrations
                        crowning these enterprises were undertaken in such perilous circumstances and carried
                        out despite the formidable obstacles engendered through prolongation of hostilities.
                        National administrative headquarters were established in Ṭihrán, Cairo, Ba<u>gh</u>dád, Delhi and Sydney, national and international endowments were enriched and assemblies
                        incorporated in countries confronted by growing threat of invasion and encirclement.

                        <a id="748218347" class="brl-location"></a>The Second Seven Year Plan inaugurating the transatlantic mission embracing Scandinavia,
                        the Low Countries, Switzerland, the Iberian and Italian Peninsulas, was launched on
                        the morrow of the catastrophic upheaval despite the exhaustion, confusion, distress
                        and restrictions afflicting a war-shattered continent. The first fruits of this newly
                        launched Plan were garnered through convocation of first European Teaching Conference
                        and erection of the ninth pillar of the Universal House of Justice in the Dominion
                        of Canada despite premonitory rumblings of a third ordeal threatening to engulf the
                        Eastern and Western Hemispheres. The central structure of the Báb’s Sepulcher was
                        built while the precious life of its builder was hanging perilously in the balance.
                        Plans were drawn, contracts placed and foundations laid for its arcade while the holy
                        places were ravaged by flames of the civil strife burning fiercely in the Holy Land.

                        The American Community’s most arduous feats still lie ahead. Disasters overtaking
                        Europe and America, more afflictive than any tribulations yet suffered in either continent,
                        may yet attend still more majestic revelations in the unfoldment of concluding stage
                        of the Second Seven Year Plan destined to witness successively the raising of the
                        tenth and eleventh pillars of the Universal House of Justice, and the celebration
                        of the Golden Jubilee of the Mother Temple of the West.

                        continually enlarged and steadily consolidated. The various agencies designed to carry

                        Author, must, likewise, be vigilantly preserved, supported and encouraged. The essential

                        emergence of these Latin American communities into independent existence steadily

                        has been achieved. Above all, the momentous enterprise initiated in the transatlantic

                        its potentialities, so infinitely meritorious, must in the face of obstacles, however
                        insurmountable they may seem, be continually reinvigorated through undiminished financial
                        support, through an ever-expanding supply of literature in each of the required languages,
                        through frequent, and whenever possible prolonged, visits of itinerant teachers, through

                        and last but not least through the exertion of sustained and concentrated efforts
                        designed to supplement these foci of Bahá’í national administrative activity with
                        subsidiary centers whose formation will herald the inauguration of teaching enterprises

                        of the first stage in the execution of His Plan, Who conferred upon them the privilege

                        same Plan, continue through the further unfoldment of the second stage in its evolution

                        the attainment of full spiritual manhood, and enable them eventually, through the
                        long and slow processes of evolution and in conformity with the future requirements
                        of a continually evolving Plan, to manifest before the eyes of the members of their
                        sister communities, their countrymen and the whole world, and in all their plenitude,
                        the potentialities inherent within them, and which in the fullness of time, must reflect

                        <a id="399769637" class="brl-location"></a>The American Bahá’í Community, undefeated as yet in the performance of any task undertaken
                        collectively by its members, in the course of its eventful history, is now entering
                        a period of grave emergency, that will try the mettle of every single one of its members.
                        Severe as the challenge will be, however prolonged the test, no matter how distracting
                        the condition of the world about them, the issues which claim every ounce of their
                        energy and call for their sustained, wholehearted, concentrated attention are so weighty
                        that none can evaluate at present the influence they will exert on the course of the
                        community’s future destiny.

                        <a id="076838580" class="brl-location"></a>There can be no doubt that the Second Seven Year Plan, the vital link binding the
                        initial and concluding stages of the first epoch in the progressive evolution of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s
                        long-term continually unfolding Plan, has reached its crucial phase—a phase on which
                        hinge the fortunes not only of the Plan itself but of the community as a whole. The
                        fourth objective of the Plan, the transatlantic project, on which its members have
                        embarked, has, four years ahead of schedule, been, to all intents and purposes, victoriously
                        achieved. The third objective has been partly attained, while its complete fulfillment,
                        as a direct consequence of the marvelous success that has attended the valiant labors
                        of the American pioneers and the newly enrolled native believers in Latin America,
                        appears to be now fully assured. The attainment of the first objective has, as a result
                        of the remarkable impetus given, during the opening years of the Plan, to the multiplication
                        of spiritual assemblies and the proclamation of the Faith in North America, been greatly
                        facilitated, and will, with steady effort, involving not too great an expenditure
                        of energy, be insured in the course of the concluding phase of the Plan. The completion
                        of the Mother Temple of the West, the sacredness of which neither the first Ma<u>sh</u>riqu’l-A<u>dh</u>kár of the Bahá’í world, nor any future House of Worship to be erected by the followers
                        of Bahá’u’lláh, in any country, at any future date, can rival, in time for the celebration
                        of its Jubilee, is the one remaining objective that now hangs precariously in the
                        balance. Owing to a combination of circumstances wholly beyond the control of its
                        builders, this task has assumed a critical importance, and is of such vital urgency,
                        that no prosecutor of the Plan, eager to witness its consummation, can afford to ignore
                        for a moment.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="869859223" class="brl-location"></a>The sacrifice demanded is such as to have no parallel whatsoever in the history of
                        that community. The manifold issues inextricably interwoven with the campaign audaciously
                        launched for the achievement of this high objective are of such a weighty character
                        as to overshadow every enterprise embarked upon through the organized efforts of its
                        members, in either the concluding years of the Heroic Age of the Faith or the first
                        epoch of the Age which succeeded it. The two years during which this emergency will
                        be most keenly felt coincide on the one hand with a period of increasing distraction
                        occasioned by the uncertainties, the perils and fears of a steadily worsening international
                        situation, and on the other with the centenary of one of the most turbulent, afflictive
                        and glorious stages of Bahá’í history—a stage immortalized by an effusion of blood,
                        a self-abnegation, a heroism unsurpassed not only in the annals of the Faith but in
                        the world’s spiritual history. How meritorious, indeed, are the self-denying acts
                        which this supremely challenging hour now calls forth, amidst the perplexities and
                        confusion which present-day society is now experiencing! And yet, how trifling in
                        comparison with the self-immolation of the most distinguished, the most precious heroes
                        and saints of the Primitive Age of our glorious Faith! An outpouring of treasure,
                        no less copious than the blood shed so lavishly in the Apostolic Age of the Faith
                        by those who in the heart of the Asiatic continent proclaimed its birth to the world,
                        can befit their spiritual descendants, who, in the present Formative Age of the Bahá’í
                        Dispensation, have championed the Cause, and assumed so preponderating a share in
                        the erection of its Administrative Order, and are now engaged in the final stage of
                        the building of the House that incarnates the soul of that Faith in the American continent.
                        No sacrifice can be deemed too great to insure the completion of such an edifice—the
                        most holy House of Worship ever to be associated with the Faith of the Most Great
                        Name—an edifice whose inception has shed such a luster on the closing years of the
                        Heroic Age of the Bahá’í Dispensation, which has assumed a concrete shape in the present
                        Formative stage in the evolution of our beloved Faith, whose dependencies must spring
                        into existence in the course of successive epochs of this same Age, and whose fairest
                        fruits will be garnered in the Age that is to come, the last, the Golden Age of the
                        initial and brightest Dispensation of the five-thousand-century Bahá’í Cycle.

                        <a id="097876207" class="brl-location"></a>“A most wonderful and thrilling motion will appear in the world of existence,” are
                        ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s own words, predicting the release of spiritual forces that must accompany
                        the completion of this most hallowed House of Worship. “From that point of light,”
                        He, further glorifying that edifice, has written, “the spirit of teaching … will permeate
                        to all parts of the world.” And again: “Out of this Ma<u>sh</u>riqu’l-A<u>dh</u>kár, without doubt, thousands of Ma<u>sh</u>riqu’l-A<u>dh</u>kárs will be born.” “It marks the inception of the Kingdom of God on earth.”

                        <a id="017454409" class="brl-location"></a>Again I repeat—and I cannot overrate the vital, the unique importance of the campaign
                        now launched to insure the completion of such an edifice—the immediate destiny of
                        the American Bahá’í Community is intimately and inescapably bound up with the outcome
                        of this newly launched, this severely trying, soul-purging, spiritually uplifting
                        campaign. The God-given mission, constituting the birthright, and proclaiming the
                        primacy of a community whose members the Founder of that community, the Center of
                        the Covenant Himself, has addressed as the “Apostles of Bahá’u’lláh,” can only be
                        fulfilled if they befittingly obey the specific Mandate issued by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in
                        His Tablets of the Divine Plan. The execution of this Mandate is, in its turn, dependent
                        upon the triumphant conclusion of the Second Seven Year Plan, the second stage in
                        the series of specific plans formulated to insure the successful termination of the
                        opening phase in the execution of that Mandate. Indeed, the successive plans, inaugurated
                        since the birth of the second Bahá’í century, by the British, the Indian, the Persian,
                        the Australia-New Zealand, the Iráqí, the German and the Egyptian National Assemblies,
                        with the exception of the plan undertaken by the Canadian National Assembly, which
                        forms an integral part of the Plan associated with the Tablets of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, are
                        but supplements to the vast enterprise whose features have been delineated in those
                        Tablets and are to be regarded, by their very nature, as regional in scope, in contrast
                        with the world-embracing character of the mission entrusted to the community of the
                        champion builders of the World Order of Bahá’u’lláh, and the torch-bearers of the
                        civilization which that Order must eventually establish. As to the Second Seven Year
                        Plan itself, its eventual success must depend on the attainment of its second and
                        most vital objective. This objective, in its turn, cannot be achieved unless the two-year
                        campaign, now launched by the elected representatives of this community, is successfully
                        carried out. Nor can this campaign yield its richest fruit unless and until the community,
                        in its entirety, participates in this nation-wide sacrificial effort. Nor can this
                        collective effort be blessed, to the fullest extent possible, unless the contributions
                        made by its members involve acts of self-abnegation, not only on the part of those
                        of modest means, but also by those endowed with substantial resources. Nor, indeed,
                        can these self-denying acts, by both the rich and the poor, be productive of the fullest
                        possible benefit unless this sacrificial effort is neither momentary nor haphazard,
                        but rather systematic and continuous throughout the period of the present emergency.

                        than ever before, through greater austerity at home and increasing audacity in foreign
                        fields, both in Latin America and Europe, their grim determination at whatever cost,

                        to carry forward unremittingly their task to its triumphant conclusion.

                        open prospect of glorious inauguration at appointed time of third collective Plan

                        immediate destiny of Temple enterprise. Owing to relaxation of pressure occasioned
                        by critical situation advise direct special attention to invigorate activities conducted
                        in Latin America and European continent. Need for voluntary, self-supporting, wholly
                        dedicated pioneers calculated to supplement newly launched undertaking in both fields
                        is still pressing and acquiring greater urgency owing to approaching emergence of
                        Latin American national assemblies and necessity to consolidate swiftly the newly-formed
                        local assemblies in ten European goal countries. Heart uplifted at contemplation of
                        mighty range of accomplishments embracing so vast a field in both hemispheres. Prayers

                        has exhibited so marvelous a vitality, must, within the limits of the homeland itself,
                        be neither interrupted nor suffer a decline. The groups and isolated centers so painstakingly
                        formed and established must, conjointly with this highly commendable and essential

                        the combined resources of the envied trustees of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Divine Plan, should
                        be directed to the vast network of Bahá’í enterprises initiated throughout Latin America,

                        is rapidly nearing the first stage of its fruition. The flow of pioneers, so vital
                        in all its aspects, and which has yielded such inestimable benefits at the early stages
                        of this widely ramified enterprise, must, however urgent the other tasks already shouldered
                        by an overburdened yet unfailingly protected community, be neither arrested nor slacken.
                        The outpost of the newly born communities, established in the Straits of Magallanes
                        in the South, must be held with undiminished vigor and determination. The major task
                        of ensuring the breadth and solidity of the foundations laid for the establishment
                        of two national Bahá’í assemblies, through the preservation of the present assemblies,
                        groups and isolated centers, and the restoration of any of these vital centers, now
                        dissolved, to their former status, must be scrupulously watched and constantly encouraged.
                        The process of the dissemination of Bahá’í literature, of Bahá’í publication and translation,
                        must continue unabated, however much the sacrifice involved. The newly fledged institutions
                        of teaching and regional committees, of summer schools and of congresses, must be
                        continually encouraged and increasingly supported by teachers as well as administrators,
                        by pioneers from abroad, as well as by the native believers themselves. The highly
                        salutary and spiritually beneficent experiment of encouraging a more active participation
                        by these newly won supporters of the Faith in Latin America, and a greater assumption
                        of administrative responsibility on their part, in the ever expanding activities to
                        be entrusted wholly to their care in the years to come, should be, in particular,
                        developed, systematized and placed on a sure and unassailable foundation. Above all,
                        the paramount duty of deepening the spiritual life of these newly fledged, these precious
                        and highly esteemed co-workers, and of enlightening their minds regarding the essential
                        verities enshrined in their Faith, its fundamental institutions, its history and genesis—the
                        twin Covenants of Bahá’u’lláh and of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, the present Administrative Order,
                        the future World Order, the Laws of the Most Holy Book, the inseparable institutions
                        of the Guardianship and of the Universal House of Justice, the salient events of the
                        Heroic and Formative Ages of the Faith, and its relationship with the Dispensations
                        that have preceded it, its attitude toward the social and political organizations
                        by which it is surrounded—must continue to constitute the most vital aspect of the
                        great spiritual Crusade launched by the champions of the Faith from among the peoples
                        of their sister republics in the South.

                        <a id="004909102" class="brl-location"></a>The magnitude of the tasks these heroes and champions of the Faith are summoned, at

                        southern extremity of Chile in the Western Hemisphere, and from Scandinavia in the
                        north, to the Iberian peninsula in the south of the European continent, is, indeed,
                        breath-taking in its implications and back-breaking in the strain it imposes. The
                        sacrifices they are called upon to voluntarily make for the successful performance
                        of such herculean, such holy, such epoch-making tasks, are comparable to none but
                        those which their spiritual forbears have willingly accepted at the hour of the birth
                        of their Faith more than a hundred years ago. Theirs is the privilege, no less meritorious
                        and perhaps as epoch-making, to preside, in their own homeland and its neighboring
                        continents, over, and direct the forces generated by, the birth of an order that posterity
                        will acclaim as both the offspring of that Faith, and the precursor of the Golden
                        Age in which that same Faith must, in the fullness of time, find its fullest expression
                        and most glorious consummation.

                        extensive a field, in such a brief time, at such great sacrifice, for so precious
                        a Cause, and in the course of such turbulent years, I cannot but feel the deepest
                        sense of gratitude the like of which no achievement, single or collective, rendered
                        in any other part of the globe, by any community associated with the Cause of the
                        Most Great Name has evoked. For what it will and must achieve in the future I entertain
                        feelings of warm expectation and serene confidence. For it, I will continue, from

                        established throughout a hundred countries representing over thirty races and extending
                        as far north as the Arctic Circle and as far south as the Straits of Magallanes, equipped
                        with literature translated into sixty languages and possessing endowments nearing

                        in its World Center, consolidated through the incorporation of over a hundred of its
                        national and local assemblies and reinforced through the proclamation of its independence
                        in the East, its recognition in the West, eulogized by royalty, buttressed by nine
                        pillars sustaining the future structure of its supreme administrative council, energized
                        through the simultaneous prosecution of specific plans conducted under the aegis of

                        in the fortunes of the Second Seven Year Plan, has been successfully traversed, and
                        deserves to be regarded as a memorable episode in the history of the Faith and the
                        unfoldment of the Plan in the North American continent. An effort, prodigious, nation-wide,
                        sustained, and reminiscent in its heroism and consecration of the immortal exploits
                        of the dawn-breakers of the Apostolic Age of the Bahá’í Dispensation, has been exerted
                        by their spiritual descendants, in circumstances which, though totally different in
                        character, are yet no less challenging and for a cause as meritorious—an effort that
                        has indeed outshone the high endeavors that have distinguished for so long the record
                        of service associated with the American Bahá’í Community. All of its members who have
                        participated in this collective undertaking should be heartily congratulated, particularly
                        those who, by their acts of self-abnegation, have emulated the example of the heroes
                        of our Faith at the early dawn of its history. The entire Bahá’í world is stirred
                        when contemplating the range of such an effort, the depth of consecration reached
                        by those who have participated in it, the results it has achieved, the noble purpose
                        it has served. My heart overflows with gratitude for the repeated evidences of worthiness
                        demonstrated by this generous-hearted, valiant and dedicated community which has,
                        no matter how onerous the task, how challenging the issue, how distracting the external
                        circumstances with which it has been surrounded, never shirked its duty or hesitated
                        for a moment.

                        of the Martyr-Prophet of our Faith, and packed with poignant memories of the persecutions
                        of Zanján which stained its history a hundred years ago and carried its fortunes to
                        almost its lowest ebb, and were a prelude to the most ghastly holocaust ever experienced
                        by its followers, must witness as it rolls forward to its close, a still more striking
                        demonstration of the tenacity of the members of this community, a still nobler display
                        of acts of self-sacrifice, a still more inspiring manifestation of solidarity, and
                        evidences of a grimmer determination, of a greater courage and perseverance in response
                        to the triple call of this present hour.

                        part of those who have so enthusiastically embarked upon it, who have so conscientiously
                        and painstakingly shepherded it along its destined course and throughout the early

                        witnessing the first efflorescence of their mammoth pioneer labors. The construction

                        of the American Bahá’í Community, affording them the first historic opportunity of

                        as urgent and sacred, are crowding, in quick succession, upon a community youthful
                        and valorous in spirit, rich in experience, triumphant in the past, sensible of its
                        future obligations, keenly aware of the sublimity of its world mission, inflexibly
                        resolved to follow with unfaltering steps the road of its destiny. The world situation
                        is perilous and gloomy. Rumblings from far and near bode evil for the immediate fortunes
                        of a sadly distracted society. The Second Seven Year Plan is now approaching its conclusion.
                        The Centenary of the Martyrdom of the Báb with all its poignant memories is upon us.
                        We are entering a period crowded with the centenaries of the direst calamities—massacres,
                        sieges, captivities, spoliations and tortures involving thousands of heroes—men, women
                        and children—the world’s greatest Faith has ever experienced. Another centenary commemorating
                        an event as tragic and infinitely more glorious is fast approaching. Time is short.
                        Opportunities, though multiplying with every passing hour, will not recur, some for
                        another century, others never again. However severe the challenge, however multiple
                        the tasks, however short the time, however somber the world outlook, however limited
                        the material resources of a hard-pressed adolescent community, the untapped sources
                        of celestial strength from which it can draw are measureless, in their potencies,
                        and will unhesitatingly pour forth their energizing influences if the necessary daily
                        effort be made and the required sacrifices be willingly accepted.

                        on the eve of launching the far-reaching, historic campaign by sister Community of
                        the British Isles to lend valued assistance to the meritorious enterprise undertaken
                        primarily for the illumination of the tribes of East and West Africa, envisaged in
                        the Tablets of the Center of the Covenant revealed in the darkest hour of His ministry.

                        of the Faith, supplementing the work initiated fifty years ago on the North American
                        continent, forging fresh links binding the American, British and Egyptian Communities
                        and providing the prelude to the full-scale operations destined to be launched at
                        a later period of the unfoldment of the Divine Plan aiming at the conversion of the

                        climax and the Centenary of the birth of Bahá’u’lláh’s Mission is fast approaching,
                        will further ennoble the record of the world-embracing tasks valiantly undertaken
                        by the American Bahá’í Community and constitute a worthy response to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s
                        insistent call raised on behalf of the race He repeatedly blessed and loved so dearly
                        and for whose illumination He ardently prayed and for whose future He cherished the
                        brightest hopes.

                        not content with the successful conclusion, in their entirety, of the tasks assigned
                        to them, must aspire to celebrate befittingly this historic occasion, as becomes the
                        chosen recipients, and the privileged trustees, of a divinely conceived Plan, through
                        emblazoning with still more conspicuous exploits, their record of stewardship to a
                        Faith whose Author has issued such a ringing call to the rulers of the American continent,
                        and the Center of Whose Covenant has entrusted the American Bahá’í Community with
                        so glorious a mission. Indeed the present stage in the construction of the superstructure
                        of so holy a shrine imperatively demands a concentration of attention and resources
                        commensurate with the high position occupied by this community, with the freedom it
                        enjoys and the material means at its disposal. The signing of two successive contracts,
                        for the masonry of the octagon, the cylinder and the dome of the edifice, necessitated
                        by a sudden worsening of the international situation, which might cut off indefinitely
                        the provision of the same stones used for the erection of the arcade and the parapet
                        of that Sepulcher, and amounting to no less than one hundred and ninety thousand dollars;
                        the subsidiary contracts for the provision of steel and cement for the erection of
                        the wrought iron balustrade and the metal window frames of both the octagon and the
                        cylinder, involving an additional expenditure of no less than twenty thousand dollars,
                        to which must be added the cost of the excavation for and the sinking of the eight
                        piers designed to support the weight of the dome and the immediate construction of
                        the octagon—these call for a stupendous effort on the part of all Bahá’í communities
                        and a self-abnegation unprecedented in Bahá’í history. A drastic reduction of national
                        and local budgets; the allocation of substantial sums by all national assemblies;
                        the participation of individuals through sustained and direct donations to the first
                        international and incomparably holy enterprise synchronizing with the birth of the
                        International Bahá’í Council at the very heart and center of a world-encircling Faith
                        can alone insure the uninterrupted progress of an undertaking which, coupled with
                        the completion of the Mother Temple of the West, cannot fail to produce tremendous
                        repercussions in the Holy Land, in the North American continent and throughout the
                        world. A period of austerity covering the two-year interval separating us from the
                        Centenary celebrations of the Year Nine, prolonging so unexpectedly the austerity
                        period already traversed by the American Bahá’í Community, and now extended to embrace
                        its sister communities throughout the Bahá’í world, is evidently not only essential
                        for the attainment of so transcendent a goal, but also supremely befitting when we
                        recall the nature and dimensions of the holocaust which a hundred years ago crimson-dyed
                        the annals of our Faith, which posterity will recognize as the bloodiest episode of
                        the most tragic period of the Heroic Age of the Bahá’í Dispensation, which involved
                        the martyrdom of that incomparable heroine Táhirih, which was immediately preceded
                        by the imprisonment of Bahá’u’lláh in the subterranean dungeon of Ṭihrán, and which
                        sealed the fate of thousands of men, women and children in circumstances of unspeakable
                        savagery and on a scale unapproached throughout subsequent stages of Bahá’í history.

                        of our Faith to One “from Whom God hath caused to proceed the knowledge of all that
                        was and shall be,” “the Primal Point from which have been generated all created things.”

                        conferred on the Herald of our Faith, is none other than the entire planet. Within
                        the heart of this planet lies the “Most Holy Land,” acclaimed by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá as “the
                        Nest of the Prophets” and which must be regarded as the center of the world and the
                        Qiblih of the nations. Within this Most Holy Land rises the Mountain of God of immemorial
                        sanctity, the Vineyard of the Lord, the Retreat of Elijah, Whose return the Báb Himself
                        symbolizes. Reposing on the breast of this holy mountain are the extensive properties
                        permanently dedicated to, and constituting the sacred precincts of, the Báb’s holy
                        Sepulcher. In the midst of these properties, recognized as the international endowments
                        of the Faith, is situated the most holy court, an enclosure comprising gardens and
                        terraces which at once embellish, and lend a peculiar charm to, these sacred precincts.
                        Embosomed in these lovely and verdant surroundings stands in all its exquisite beauty
                        the mausoleum of the Báb, the shell designed to preserve and adorn the original structure
                        raised by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá as the tomb of the Martyr-Herald of our Faith. Within this
                        shell is enshrined that Pearl of Great Price, the holy of holies, those chambers which
                        constitute the tomb itself, and which were constructed by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. Within the
                        heart of this holy of holies is the tabernacle, the vault wherein reposes the most
                        holy casket. Within this vault rests the alabaster sarcophagus in which is deposited
                        that inestimable jewel, the Báb’s holy dust. So precious is this dust that the very
                        earth surrounding the edifice enshrining this dust has been extolled by the Center
                        of Bahá’u’lláh’s Covenant, in one of His Tablets in which He named the five doors
                        belonging to the six chambers which He originally erected after five of the believers
                        associated with the construction of the Shrine, as being endowed with such potency
                        as to have inspired Him in bestowing these names, whilst the tomb itself housing this
                        dust He acclaimed as the spot round which the Concourse on high circle in adoration.

                        the steady consolidation of the victories already won in the ten goal countries of

                        as well as in the new European field, marking the projection of its world mission
                        across the seas, the American Bahá’í Community must deploy its forces, hoist still
                        higher its pennants, and erect still more glorious memorials to the heroism, the constancy
                        and the devotion of its members. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, Whose Plan they are executing in both
                        hemispheres, and to Whose summons they are now responding in the African continent;
                        the Báb, Whose Sepulcher they are helping to erect; above all Bahá’u’lláh, Whose embryonic
                        World Order they are building in the Holy Land and in other continents of the globe,
                        look down upon them from Their retreats of glory, applauding their acts, guiding their
                        footsteps, vouchsafing Their blessings, and laying up, in the storehouses of the Abhá

                        the most heroic, period in the annals of a hundred-year-old Revelation. This period,

                        <a id="500117639" class="brl-location"></a>The historic significance of this period cannot indeed be overestimated. For it was
                        a hundred years ago that a Faith, which had already been oppressed by a staggering
                        weight of untold tribulations; which had sustained shattering blows in Mázindarán,
                        Nayríz, Ṭihrán and Zanján, and indeed throughout every province in the land of its
                        birth; which had lost its greatest exponents through the tragic martyrdom of most
                        of the Letters of the Living, and particularly of the valiant Mullá Ḥusayn and of
                        the erudite Vahíd and which had been afflicted with the supreme calamity of losing
                        its Divine Founder; was being subjected to still more painful ordeals—ordeals which
                        robbed it of both the heroic Hujjat and of the far-famed Táhirih; which caused it
                        to pass through a reign of terror, and to experience a blood-bath of unprecedented
                        severity, which inflicted on it one of the greatest humiliations it has ever suffered
                        through the attempted assassination of the sovereign himself, and which unloosed a
                        veritable deluge of barbarous atrocities in Ṭihrán, Mázindarán, Nayríz and <u>Sh</u>íráz before which paled the horrors of the siege of Zanján, and which swept no less
                        a figure than Bahá’u’lláh Himself—the last remaining pillar of a Faith that had been
                        so rudely shaken, so ruthlessly denuded of its chief buttresses—into the subterranean
                        dungeon of Ṭihrán, an imprisonment that was soon followed by His cruel banishment,
                        in the depths of an exceptionally severe winter, from His native land to ‘Iráq. To
                        these tribulations He Himself has referred as “afflictions” that “rained” upon Him,
                        whilst the blood shed by His companions and lovers He characterized as the blood which
                        “impregnated” the earth with the “wondrous revelation” of God’s “might.”

                        <a id="209688136" class="brl-location"></a>Nor should the momentous character of the unique event, that may be regarded as the
                        climax and consummation of this tragic period, be overlooked or underestimated, inasmuch
                        as its centenary synchronizes with the termination of the sixteen-month interval separating
                        the American Bahá’í Community from the conclusion of its present Plan. This unique
                        event, the centenary of which is to be befittingly celebrated, not only in the American
                        continent but throughout the Bahá’í world, and is destined to be regarded as the culmination
                        of the Second Seven Year Plan, is none other than the “Year Nine,” anticipated 2,000
                        years ago as the “third woe” by St. John the Divine, alluded to by both <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Aḥmad and Siyyid Kázim—the twin luminaries that heralded the advent of the Faith
                        of the Báb—specifically mentioned and extolled by the Herald of the Bahá’í Dispensation
                        in His Writings, and eulogized by both the Founder of our Faith and the Center of
                        His Covenant. In that year, the year “after Hin” (68), mentioned by <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Aḥmad, the year that witnessed the birth of the Mission of the promised “Qayyúm,”
                        specifically referred to by Siyyid Kázim, the “requisite number” in the words of Bahá’u’lláh
                        “of pure, of wholly consecrated and sanctified souls” had been “most secretly consummated.”
                        In that year, as testified by the pen of the Báb, the “realities of the created things”
                        were “made manifest,” “a new creation was born” and the seed of His Faith revealed
                        its “ultimate perfection.” In that year, as borne witness by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, a hitherto
                        “embryonic Faith” was born. In that year, while the Blessed Beauty lay in chains and
                        fetters, in that dark and pestilential pit, “the breezes of the All-Glorious,” as
                        He Himself described it, “were wafted” over Him. There, whilst His neck was weighted
                        down by the Qará-Guhar, His feet in stocks, breathing the fetid air of the Síyáh-<u>Ch</u>ál, He dreamed His dream and heard, “on every side,” “exalted words,” and His “tongue
                        recited” words that “no man could bear to hear.”
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="146217191" class="brl-location"></a>There, as He Himself has recorded, under the impact of this dream, He experienced
                        the onrushing force of His newly revealed Mission, that “flowed” even as “a mighty
                        torrent” from His “head” to His “breast,” whereupon “every limb” of His body “would
                        be set afire.” There, in a vision, the “Most Great Spirit,” as He Himself has again
                        testified, appeared to Him, in the guise of a “Maiden” “calling” with “a most wondrous,
                        a most sweet voice” above His Head, whilst “suspended in the air” before Him and,
                        “pointing with her finger” unto His head, imparted “tidings which rejoiced” His “soul.”
                        There appeared above the horizon of that dungeon in the city of Ṭihrán, the rim of
                        the Orb of His Faith, whose dawning light had, nine years previously, broken upon
                        the city of <u>Sh</u>íráz—an Orb which, after suffering an eclipse of ten years, was destined to burst
                        forth, with its resplendent rays, upon the city of Ba<u>gh</u>dád, to mount its zenith in Adrianople, and to set eventually in the prison-fortress
                        of ‘Akká.

                        of the Second Seven Year Plan have been linked. As the tribulations, humiliations
                        and trials inflicted on the Cause of God in Persia, a century ago, moved inexorably
                        towards a climax, so must the present austerity period, inaugurated a hundred years
                        later, in the continent of America, to reflect the privations and sacrifices endured
                        so stoically by the dawn-breakers of the Heroic Age of the Faith witness, as it approaches
                        its culmination, a self-abnegation on the part of the champion-builders of the World
                        Order of Bahá’u’lláh, laboring in the present Formative Age of His Faith, which, at
                        its best, can be regarded as but a faint reflection of the self-sacrifice so gloriously
                        evinced by their spiritual forbears.

                        the ten goal countries included within its scope. The interior ornamentation of the
                        Mother Temple of the West has, before its appointed time, been completed. Other tasks,
                        no less vital, still remain to be carried, in the course of a fast shrinking period,
                        to a successful conclusion. The landscaping of the area surrounding a structure whose
                        foundations and exterior and interior ornamentation have demanded, for so many years,
                        so much effort and such constant sacrifice, must, under no circumstances, and while
                        there is yet time, be neglected, lest failure to achieve this final task mar the beauty
                        of the approaches of a national shrine which provide so suitable a setting for an
                        edifice at once so sacred and noble. The responsibilities solemnly undertaken to consolidate
                        and multiply the administrative institutions throughout all the states of the Union—a
                        task that has of late been allowed to fall into abeyance, and has been eclipsed by
                        the spectacular success attending the shining exploits of the American Bahá’í Community
                        in foreign fields—must be speedily and seriously reconsidered, for upon the constant
                        broadening and the steady reinforcement of this internal administrative structure,
                        which provides the essential base for future operations in all the continents of the
                        globe, must depend the vigor, the rapidity and the soundness of the future crusades
                        which must needs be launched in the service, and for the glory of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh,
                        and in obedience to the stirring summons issued by the Center of His Covenant in some
                        of His most weighty Tablets. Above all, the accumulating deficit which has lately
                        again thrown its somber shadow on an otherwise resplendent record of service, must,
                        through a renewed display of self-abnegation, which, though not commensurate with
                        the sacrifice of so many souls immolated on the altar of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh,
                        may at least faintly reflect its poignant heroism, be obliterated, once and for all,
                        from the record of a splendid stewardship to His Faith.

                        the launching of the Second Seven Year Plan, and in consequence of unexpected developments
                        both in the Holy Land and elsewhere, the American Bahá’í Community, ever ready to
                        bear the brunt of responsibility, under the stress of unforeseen circumstances, has
                        considerably widened the scope of its original undertakings and augmented the weight
                        shouldered by its stalwart members. At the World Center of the Faith, in response
                        to the urgent call for action, necessitated by the imperative needs of the rising
                        Sepulcher of the Báb, the formation of the Bahá’í International Council, and the establishment
                        of the State of Israel, as well as in the continent of Africa, where the appointed,
                        the chief trustees of a divinely conceived, world-encompassing Plan could not well
                        remain unmoved by the sight of the first attempts being made to introduce systematically
                        the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh and to implant its banner amongst its tribes and races, the
                        American Bahá’í Community have assumed responsibilities well exceeding the original
                        duties they had undertaken to discharge. This twofold opportunity that providentially
                        presented itself to them, to contribute to the rise and consolidation of the World
                        Center of their Faith, and to the spiritual re-awakening of a long-neglected continent,
                        must, however, be exploited to the fullest extent, if the early completion of the
                        most sacred edifice, next to the Qiblih of the Bahá’í world, is to be assured, and
                        if the executors of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Plan are to retain untarnished the primacy conferred
                        upon them by its Author.

                        them from the Most Great Jubilee, they must, upon the consummation of their present

                        of the Holy Year in the heart of Africa; in the tremendous sacrifices spontaneously
                        and repeatedly made to broaden and reinforce the foundations of the Faith in the North
                        American continent, to sustain the campaigns undertaken in Latin America, Europe and
                        Africa, and to meet the many demands of the Bahá’í Temple, rapidly nearing completion
                        in Wilmette; in the successive emergence of three national spiritual assemblies in
                        the Western Hemisphere—an outstanding contribution to the evolution and consolidation
                        of the structure of the world Administrative Order of the Faith; in the completion
                        of the interior ornamentation of the first Ma<u>sh</u>riqu’l-A<u>dh</u>kár of the West, the provision of its accessories and the initiation of the landscaping
                        of its grounds; in the support extended to the development of the institutions of
                        the World Center of the Faith; in the role played by its representatives, whether
                        as Hands of the Cause or members of the International Bahá’í Council; in the financial
                        aid unhesitatingly given to hasten the construction, and insure the completion, of
                        the superstructure of the Báb’s Sepulcher on Mt. Carmel—above all, in the share its
                        national elected representatives have assumed in providing the means for the convocation
                        of the second Intercontinental Teaching Conference of the Holy Year; in commemorating
                        worthily the dedication to public worship of the Mother Temple of the West, on the
                        occasion of its Jubilee; in befittingly inaugurating the launching of the World Spiritual
                        Crusade, and in celebrating the climax of the Holy Year marking the centenary of the
                        birth of Bahá’u’lláh’s Mission—in all these the American Bahá’í Community has fully
                        deserved the praise and gratitude of posterity, has merited the applause of the Concourse
                        on High and earned a full measure of the divine blessings and of the celestial sustenance
                        of which it will stand in such great need in the course of the prosecution of still
                        mightier and more glorious enterprises in the days to come.

                        in its character as to leave a lasting imprint not only on the destinies of the American
                        Bahá’í Community but on the fortunes of the American nation as well. It must, even

                        Order whose fabric must, in the course of successive crusades, be laboriously erected

                        the world, and reinforce a thousandfold the numerical strength as well as the material
                        power and the spiritual authority of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh.

                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="583110377" class="brl-location"></a>Of all the objectives enumerated in my message to the representatives of this community,
                        assembled on the occasion of the celebration of the climax of the Holy Year, of the
                        convocation of the second Intercontinental Teaching Conference, of the inauguration
                        of the Mother Temple of the West and of the launching of the World Spiritual Crusade,
                        the most vital, urgent and meritorious, in this the opening year of the initial phase
                        of this world-embracing enterprise, is, without doubt, the settlement of pioneers
                        in all the virgin territories and islands assigned to this community in all the continents
                        of the globe, with the exception of the few which, owing to present political obstacles,
                        cannot as yet be opened to the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh. This process already so auspiciously
                        inaugurated, which, in the course of the first eight months of the Holy Year has gathered
                        such splendid momentum, and which bids fair to astonish, stimulate and inspire the
                        entire Bahá’í world, must, during the concluding months of this same year and the
                        one succeeding it, be so accelerated as to insure the attainment of this paramount
                        objective before the lapse of two years from the official launching of this World
                        Crusade.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="945441908" class="brl-location"></a>While this goal is being vigorously pursued, close attention must be directed to the
                        preliminary measures for the establishment of the first dependency of the Mother Temple
                        of the West, as well as to the completion of the landscaping of its grounds, a double
                        task that will, on the one hand, mark the termination of the fifty-year-old process
                        of the construction of the central Bahá’í House of Worship, and proclaim, on the other,
                        the commencement of another designed to culminate in the establishment in its plenitude
                        of the institution of the Ma<u>sh</u>riqu’l-A<u>dh</u>kár as conceived by Bahá’u’lláh and envisaged by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. Moreover, immediate
                        consideration should be given to two other issues of prime importance, namely the
                        purchase of land, which need not exceed for the present one acre, in anticipation
                        of the construction of the first Ma<u>sh</u>riqu’l-A<u>dh</u>kár of South Africa, and the prompt translation of a suitable Bahá’í pamphlet into
                        the American and European languages allocated to your assembly, and its publication
                        and wide dissemination among the peoples and tribes for whom it has been primarily
                        designed.

                        revealed” and “the mysteries of His Faith shall be unveiled,” addressed by Him in
                        His Tablets of the Divine Plan as the “Apostles” of His Father; the recipients of
                        the overwhelming majority of these same Tablets constituting the Charter of that Plan;

                        American Bahá’í conquerors to settle in virgin territories and islands will, as befits

                        and designed to be permanently deposited at the entrance door of the Inner Sanctuary
                        of Bahá’u’lláh’s Most Holy Tomb, that the limited area of land required for the erection
                        of four future Bahá’í Temples, in Rome, Stockholm, Panama City and Johannesburg, will
                        be bought, that the landscaping of the grounds of the Temple in Wilmette will be completed,
                        and that the translation and the publication of the aforementioned pamphlet in the
                        specified languages will be accomplished.

                        will brook no delay, which will carry the Faith to still higher levels of achievement

                        since the early days of the Heroic Age of the Faith—an enterprise which in its vastness,
                        organization and unifying power, has no parallel in the world’s spiritual history.

                        of the globe, prove their worth as gallant warriors battling for the Cause of Bahá’u’lláh.
                        Indeed, from this very hour until the eve of the Most Great Jubilee, each and every

                        and admittedly strenuous enterprise, they must, beyond the shadow of a doubt, vindicate

                        the time for the truth of His remarkable assertion that that same homeland is “equipped

                        the envy of the world and be blest in both the East and the West,” to be strikingly
                        and unmistakably demonstrated. “Should success crown” their “enterprise,” He, moreover,
                        has assured them, “the throne of the Kingdom of God will, in the plenitude of its

                        of the world Administrative Order of Bahá’u’lláh; will surpass the magnificent accomplishments

                        the prosecution of the Second Seven Year Plan, have exerted so lasting an influence
                        on the fortunes of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh in the Antilles, throughout the republics
                        of Central America, in each of the ten republics of South America, in no less than
                        ten sovereign states in the continent of Europe, and in various dependencies on the
                        eastern and western shores, as well as in the heart of the African continent.

                        exploits so stirring and momentous that they stand unsurpassed in the annals of any

                        the sole champion of the newly proclaimed Covenant of Bahá’u’lláh; foremost in its
                        decisive contribution to the creation of the pattern, the erection of the fabric,
                        the enlargement of the limits, and the consolidation of the institutions of the embryonic

                        its homeland through the distinction conferred by Him on the community’s two leading
                        centers, the one as the site where He laid the cornerstone of the holiest House of
                        Worship in the Bahá’í world, and the other the scene of the proclamation of His Father’s
                        Covenant; the triumphant prosecutor of two successive historic Plans, boldly initiated
                        by its elected national representatives for the propagation of the Faith it has espoused
                        in the land of its birth, in the Dominion of Canada, in Central and South America

                        Asiatic and African continents, and as the formulator of the national Bahá’í constitution,
                        embodying the by-laws regulating the internal affairs of the members of the Bahá’í
                        communities; incomparable throughout the Bahá’í world as the dynamic agent responsible
                        for the opening of the vast majority of the over two hundred sovereign states and
                        chief dependencies of the globe to the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh; surpassing even its over
                        a hundred-year old sister community in the cradle of that Faith in the number and
                        variety of isolated centers, groups and local assemblies it has succeeded in establishing

                        material resources, often involving a self-abnegation reminiscent of the self-sacrifice
                        of the dawn-breakers of the Apostolic Age of the Faith, for the sole purpose of systematically
                        propagating the Faith it has pledged itself to serve, of enhancing its prestige, of

                        the crass materialism, which lays excessive and ever-increasing emphasis on material
                        well-being, forgetful of those things of the spirit on which alone a sure and stable
                        foundation can be laid for human society. It is this same cancerous materialism, born
                        originally in Europe, carried to excess in the North American continent, contaminating
                        the Asiatic peoples and nations, spreading its ominous tentacles to the borders of
                        Africa, and now invading its very heart, which Bahá’u’lláh in unequivocal and emphatic
                        language denounced in His Writings, comparing it to a devouring flame and regarding
                        it as the chief factor in precipitating the dire ordeals and world-shaking crises

                        in the hearts of men. Indeed a foretaste of the devastation which this consuming fire
                        will wreak upon the world, and with which it will lay waste the cities of the nations
                        participating in this tragic world-engulfing contest, has been afforded by the last
                        World War, marking the second stage in the global havoc which humanity, forgetful

                        materialism against which the voice of the Center of Bahá’u’lláh’s Covenant was raised,
                        with pathetic persistence, from platform and pulpit, in His addresses to the heedless

                        found themselves suddenly swept into the vortex of a tempest which in its range and

                        as witnessed by the widening of the gulf separating the protagonists of two antagonistic
                        schools of thought which, however divergent in their ideologies, are to be commonly

                        loss in blood and treasure, swelling the national budget and progressively depreciating
                        the currency of the state; the confusion, the vacillation, the suspicions besetting

                        accretion of strength to the arch enemy of the system championed by the American Union
                        in consequence of the re-alignment of the powers in the Asiatic continent and particularly
                        in the Far East—these have, moreover, contributed their share, in recent years, to
                        the deterioration of a situation which, if not remedied, is bound to involve the American
                        nation in a catastrophe of undreamed-of dimensions and of untold consequences to the

                        fellow citizen, a situation which, if allowed to drift, will, in the words of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá,
                        cause the streets of American cities to run with blood, aggravating thereby the havoc
                        which the fearful weapons of destruction, raining from the air, and amassed by a ruthless,
                        a vigilant, a powerful and inveterate enemy, will wreak upon those same cities.

                        sovereignty and upholding a political system, manifestly at variance with the needs
                        of a world already contracted into a neighborhood and crying out for unity, will find
                        itself purged of its anachronistic conceptions, and prepared to play a preponderating
                        role, as foretold by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, in the hoisting of the standard of the Lesser Peace,
                        in the unification of mankind, and in the establishment of a world federal government
                        on this planet. These same fiery tribulations will not only firmly weld the American
                        nation to its sister nations in both hemispheres, but will through their cleansing
                        effect, purge it thoroughly of the accumulated dross which ingrained racial prejudice,
                        rampant materialism, widespread ungodliness and moral laxity have combined, in the
                        course of successive generations, to produce, and which have prevented her thus far
                        from assuming the role of world spiritual leadership forecast by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s unerring
                        pen—a role which she is bound to fulfill through travail and sorrow.

                        tempo and the distractions of city life, the progress of the Faith has been retarded,
                        must signalize the inauguration of this most intensive and challenging phase of the
                        Crusade on the home front. Most certainly and emphatically must the lead be given
                        by the two focal centers of Bahá’í activity which rank among the oldest of and occupy
                        the most honored position among, the cities throughout the American Union, the one
                        as the mother city of the North American continent, the other named by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
                        the City of the Covenant. Indeed, so grave are the exigencies of the present hour,
                        and so critical the political position of the country, that were a bare fifteen adult
                        Bahá’ís to be left in each of these cities, over which unsuspected dangers are hanging,
                        it would still be regarded as adequate for the maintenance of their local spiritual
                        assemblies.

                        of the whole fabric must depend. He it is who acts as one of the countless links in
                        the mighty chain that now girdles the globe. He it is who serves as one of the multitude
                        of bricks which support the structure and insure the stability of the administrative

                        afflicted the Faith since the inception, over thirty years ago, of the Formative Age
                        of the Bahá’í Dispensation, such as a seizure of the keys of the foremost Shrine of
                        the Bahá’í world by the covenant-breakers residing in the Holy Land; the occupation
                        of the House of Bahá’u’lláh by His traditional enemies in Ba<u>gh</u>dád; the expropriation of the first Ma<u>sh</u>riqu’l-A<u>dh</u>kár of the Bahá’í world in Turkistán and the virtual extinction of the I<u>sh</u>qábád Bahá’í Community; the disabilities suffered by the Egyptian Bahá’í Community
                        as a result of the verdict of the Egyptian ecclesiastical court and the historic pronouncements
                        of the highest dignitaries of Sunní Islám in Egypt; the defection of the members of
                        ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s family and the machinations and eventual deviation of various recognized
                        yet highly ambitious leaders, teachers, as well as administrators, in Persia, Egypt,
                        Germany and the United States—more grievous than any of these, this latest manifestation
                        of the implacable hatred, and relentless opposition, of the as yet firmly entrenched,
                        politically influential avowed adversaries of God’s infant Faith, threatens to become

                        ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s ministry, and is tragically reminiscent of the tribulations experienced
                        by the dawn-breakers of the Heroic Age of the Faith at the hour of its birth in that
                        sorely tried, long-agitated land.

                        came to a head, as the result of the ceaseless intrigue of the fanatical and determined
                        ecclesiastical opponents of the Faith, ever ready to seize their chance, in times
                        of confusion, and to strike mercilessly, at an opportune hour, at the very root of
                        that Faith and of its swiftly developing, steadily consolidating administrative institutions.

                        both <u>Sh</u>í’ah and Sunní Islám.

                        <a id="314359770" class="brl-location"></a>This premeditated campaign was heralded by violent and repeated public denunciations
                        of the Faith over the air, from the pulpit, and through the press, defaming its holy

                        perverting its history. It was formally launched by the government’s official pronouncement
                        in the Majlis outlawing the Faith and banning its activities throughout the land.
                        It was soon followed by the senseless and uncivilized demolition of the imposing dome
                        of the Bahá’í Central Administrative Headquarters in the capital. It assumed serious
                        proportions through the seizure and occupation of all Bahá’í administrative headquarters
                        throughout the provinces.

                        by a series of atrocities simultaneously and shamelessly perpetrated in most of the
                        provinces, bringing in its wake desolation to Bahá’í homes, economic ruin to Bahá’í
                        families, and staining still further the records of <u>Sh</u>í’ah Islám in that troubled land.

                        <a id="116405201" class="brl-location"></a>In <u>Sh</u>íráz, in the province of Fárs, the cradle of the Faith, the House of the Báb, ordained
                        by Bahá’u’lláh in His Most Holy Book as the foremost place of pilgrimage in the land
                        of His birth, was twice desecrated, its walls severely damaged, its windows broken
                        and its furniture partly destroyed and carried away. The neighboring house of the
                        Báb’s maternal uncle was razed to the ground. Bahá’u’lláh’s ancestral home in Tákúr,
                        in the province of Mázindarán, the scene of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s early childhood, was occupied.
                        Shops and farms, constituting, in most cases, the sole source of livelihood to peaceful
                        Bahá’í families, were plundered. Crops and livestock, assets patiently acquired by
                        often poor, but always peace-loving, law-abiding farmers, were wantonly destroyed.
                        Bodies in various cemeteries were first disinterred and then viciously mutilated.
                        The homes of rich and poor alike were forcibly entered and ruthlessly looted. Both
                        adults and children were publicly set upon, reviled, beaten and ridiculed. Young women
                        were abducted, and compelled, against their parents’ wishes and their own, to marry
                        Muslims. Boys and girls were mobbed at school, mocked and expelled. A boycott, in
                        many cases, was imposed by butchers and bakers, who refused to sell to the adherents
                        of the Faith the barest necessities of life. A girl in her teens was shamelessly raped,
                        whilst an eleven-month-old baby was heartlessly trampled underfoot. Pressure was brought
                        to bear upon the believers to recant their faith and to renounce allegiance to the
                        Cause they had espoused.

                        <a id="965497019" class="brl-location"></a>Nor was this all. Emboldened by the general applause accorded by the populace to the
                        savage perpetrators of these crimes, a mob of many hundreds marched upon the hamlet
                        of Hurmuzak, to the beating of drums and the sounding of trumpets, and, armed with
                        spades and axes, fell upon a family of seven, the oldest eighty, the youngest nineteen,
                        and, in an orgy of unrestrained fanaticism, literally hacked them to pieces.

                        since the close of the Heroic Age of the Faith, an official order has been issued
                        by the Prime Minister’s office in Ṭihrán, placing an interdiction against the employment
                        of any Bahá’ís in government service, and ordering the instant dismissal of all who
                        insist on adhering to their faith.

                        Counter measures were immediately taken, and more than a thousand appeals were addressed
                        by national and local assemblies as well as groups in all continents of the globe
                        to the highest authorities in Persia, including the <u>Sh</u>áh, in the hope of stemming the tide of persecution threatening to engulf the entire
                        Persian Bahá’í Community. Furthermore, a wide-spread campaign of publicity was initiated
                        in expectation that its repercussions would exert a restraining influence on the perpetrators
                        of these monstrous acts. An appeal was moreover lodged with the Secretary-General
                        of the United Nations, and the President of the Social and Economic Council, copies
                        of which were delivered to the representatives of the member nations of the Council,
                        to the Director of the Human Rights Division, as well as to non-governmental organizations
                        with consultative status. More recently, President Eisenhower, who, as reported in
                        the press, was the first to make mention of the attacks launched against the Faith,
                        was appealed to by the American National Spiritual Assembly as well as by all groups

                        of such an institution, fully deserves to possess its own independent House of Worship—a
                        House that will gather within its walls members of communities whose prowess has,
                        in the opening years of the second epoch of the Formative Age of the Bahá’í Dispensation,
                        eclipsed the feats performed in both the southern part of the Western Hemisphere and
                        the European continent, and conferred such luster on the annals of our Faith.

                        is, at this very hour, under the eyes of the clamorous multitudes of the adversaries
                        of the Faith pressing for its extirpation in the land of its birth, being called upon
                        to redress the scales so weighed down through the ferocious and ignoble acts of bloodthirsty
                        ecclesiastical oppressors. The erection of such an institution, at such a time, through
                        the combined efforts of the undismayed, undeflected and undefeatable upholders of
                        the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh in both the East and the West, posterity will regard as a
                        worthy answer to the challenge flung down by its bitterest, most powerful and inveterate
                        enemies. Let them give heed to the warnings and admonitions uttered, at an hour of
                        similar danger, by the Founder of the Faith Himself, on the morrow of His third banishment,
                        and addressed in clear and unmistakable language to the “Minister of the <u>Sh</u>áh” in Constantinople: “Dost thou believe thou hast the power to frustrate His will,
                        to hinder Him from executing His judgment, or to deter Him from exercising His sovereignty?
                        Pretendest thou that aught in the heavens or in the earth can resist His Faith? No,
                        by Him Who is the eternal Truth! Nothing whatsoever in the whole of creation can thwart
                        His purpose.… Know thou, moreover, that He it is Who hath by His own behest, created
                        all that is in the heavens and all that is on the earth. How can, then, the thing
                        that hath been created at His bidding prevail against Him?”

                        influence in high circles as well as among the masses. Such an emancipation, which
                        cannot be confined to Bahá’u’lláh’s native land, will, in varying measure, have its
                        repercussions in Islamic countries, or may be even preceded by a similar phenomenon
                        in neighboring territories, hastening and adding fresh impetus to the bursting of
                        the bonds that fetter the freedom of the followers of God’s infant Faith.

                        and unforgettable achievements with which the stout-hearted, high-minded and wholly
                        consecrated followers of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh have, in the course of the operations
                        of a World Spiritual Crusade, enriched, in every continent of the globe and in so
                        many islands of the seven seas, the annals of the Formative Age of His Dispensation,
                        I cannot but acknowledge, with feelings of pride, of joy, and of gratitude, the preponderating
                        share which the American Bahá’í Community, faithful to its traditions, and in keeping
                        with its high standard of stewardship to the Cause of God, has had in the conduct
                        of this world-encircling enterprise and the discharge of its manifold, its pressing
                        and sacred responsibilities. With one or two exceptions, greatly to be deplored, this
                        valiant community has, ever since the inception of this Spiritual Crusade, and in
                        every sphere of Bahá’í activities in which its participators have both individually
                        and collectively been assiduously engaged, set an example of whole-hearted dedication,
                        dogged perseverance, unstinting self-sacrifice and undeviating loyalty worthy of emulation
                        by its sister, as well as its daughter, communities over the entire face of the globe.

                        its steadfast and intrepid members, in so many sovereign states of the globe, its
                        chief dependencies and widely scattered islands, in the course of the one-year period,
                        constituting the opening phase of a memorable Plan, will no doubt be universally acclaimed
                        as a turning point of unimaginable consequence in Bahá’í history. Such feats, in so
                        many territories, during so short a time, will rank, in the eyes of posterity, as
                        superb and outstanding exploits, immortalizing the fame of the American followers
                        of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh, and as epoch-making events unsurpassed since the closing
                        of the Heroic Age of the Bahá’í Dispensation.

                        North American continent, the home front, from which have sprung, since the inception
                        of the Formative Age of the Faith, the dynamic forces which have set in motion, and
                        directed the operation, of so many processes, in both the teaching and administrative
                        spheres of Bahá’í activity, and which must continue to act as a base for the steady
                        expansion of future operations in every continent of the globe, and the extension
                        of their ramifications to the uttermost corners of the earth, and which must be increasingly
                        regarded, as the forces of internal disruption and the stress and danger of aggressiveness
                        from without gather momentum, as the sole stronghold of a Faith which cannot hope
                        to escape unscathed from the turmoil gathering around it—such a home front must, at
                        all costs, and in the shortest possible time, be spiritually reinvigorated, administratively
                        expanded, and materially replenished. The flame of devotion ignited and the enthusiasm
                        generated, during the celebrations which commemorated the centenary of the birth of
                        the Mission of the Divine Author of our Faith, and which, in the course of the years
                        immediately following it have carried the members of the American Bahá’í Community,
                        so far and so high, along the road leading to their ultimate destiny, must, in whatever
                        way possible, be fanned and continually fed throughout the entire area of the Union,
                        in every state from the Atlantic to the Pacific seaboards, in every locality where
                        Bahá’ís reside, in every heart throbbing with the love of Bahá’u’lláh. The spirit
                        that sent forth, not so long ago, in such rapid succession, so many pioneers to such
                        remote areas of the globe, must at all costs and above everything else, be recaptured,
                        for the twofold purpose of swelling the number, and of ensuring the continual flow,
                        of pioneers, so essential for the safeguarding of the prizes won in the course of
                        the several campaigns of a world-girdling Crusade, and of combatting the evil forces
                        which a relentless and all-pervasive materialism, the cancerous growth of militant
                        racialism, political corruption, unbridled capitalism, wide-spread lawlessness and
                        gross immorality, are, alas, unleashing, with ominous swiftness, amongst various classes
                        of the society to which the members of this community belong.

                        <a id="791720238" class="brl-location"></a>The administrative strongholds of a Faith, bound to be subjected on the one hand,
                        to a severe spiritual challenge from within, through the inevitable impact of these
                        devastating influences on its infant strength, and, on the other, to the onslaught
                        of ecclesiastical leaders, the traditional defenders of religious orthodoxy from without,
                        must be multiplied and reinforced for the purpose of warding off the inevitable attacks
                        of the assailants, of vindicating the ideals and principles which animate their defenders,
                        and of ensuring the ultimate victory and ascendency of the Faith itself over the nefarious
                        elements seeking to undermine it from within, and its powerful detractors aiming at
                        its extinction from without.

                        expanding Faith, be, for a moment, either ignored, neglected, or underestimated—resources
                        which a home front, materially and adequately replenished by a steady and marked influx
                        of active and wholehearted supporters from all ranks of society, can, in the long
                        run, provide. As the imperative needs of a Faith, now irresistibly advancing in every
                        direction, multiply, a corresponding increase in the financial means at the disposal
                        of its national administrators directing and controlling its operations, within and
                        beyond the confines of their homeland, to meet these essential and urgent requirements,
                        must be ensured, if its onward march is not to be either halted or slowed down.
