                        believers in their stupendous endeavor to attain their goal—a goal on which our dearly
                        beloved Greatest Holy Leaf had set her fondest hopes. I cannot, however, overlook,
                        much as I sympathize with them in their financial tribulation and anxieties, the mysterious
                        power which resides in the united will and concerted action of all the members of
                        that self-sacrificing community—a community which, since the passing of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá,
                        has lent an impetus to the advancement of the Cause out of all proportion to its numerical
                        strength, its youthfulness, and experience of the powers latent in this sacred Faith.
                        What an untold wealth of blessings will flow out of a renewed, an irrevocable resolution,
                        representing the combined will of the steadfast lovers of the Cause of God in that
                        land, to carry out, in its entirety, during the few remaining months, a Plan on which
                        so much that is vital to its worldwide interests depends! The American believers,
                        the stouthearted supporters of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh, have already given too many
                        evidences of their preponderating influence in the direction of its affairs to allow
                        the slightest disappointment to mar the radiance of their past achievements. Their
                        will to succeed must eventually triumph.

                        of East and West in political affairs calls for the utmost circumspection, tact, patience
                        and vigilance on the part of those whose function and privilege is to guard, promote
                        and administer the activities of a worldwide ever-advancing Cause. The misgivings
                        and apprehensions of individual Bahá’ís should be allayed and eventually completely
                        dispelled. Any misconception of the sane and genuine patriotism that animates every
                        Bahá’í heart, if it ever obscures or perplexes the minds of responsible government
                        officials, should be instantly and courageously dissipated. Any deliberate misrepresentation,
                        by the enemies of the Cause of God, of the aims, the tenets and methods of the administrators
                        of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh should be vigorously faced and its fallacy pitilessly
                        exposed. The Cause, to which we belong, stands on the threshold of an era of unprecedented
                        expansion. Its problems are many, divers and challenging. Our methods and ways of
                        approach must likewise be characterized by unusual sagacity, consummate skill and
                        wisdom. He will surely never fail us in meeting the needs of a critical hour.

                        the principle to which you refer that personalities should not be made centers around

                        sacred responsibility of which no adult recognized believer should be deprived, unless
                        he is associated with a community that has not as yet been in a position to establish
                        a Local Assembly. This distinguishing right which the believer possesses, however,
                        does not carry with it nor does it imply an obligation to cast his vote, if he feels
                        that the circumstances under which he lives do not justify or allow him to exercise
                        that right intelligently and with understanding. This is a matter which should be
                        left to the individual to decide for himself according to his own conscience and discretion.

                        Islamic ecclesiastical organizations that oppose it—a movement that has originated
                        in Egypt and is now spreading steadily throughout the Middle East, and will in time
                        communicate its influence to the West—imposes upon every loyal upholder of the Cause
                        the obligation of refraining from any word or action that might prejudice the position
                        which our enemies have, in recent years and of their own accord, proclaimed and established.<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#658253042">13</a></sup> This historic development, the beginnings of which could neither be recognized nor
                        even anticipated in the years immediately preceding ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s passing, may be
                        said to have signalized the Formative Period of our Faith and to have paved the way
                        for the consolidation of its Administrative Order. As this movement gains momentum,
                        as it receives added impetus from the attitude and future action of the civil authorities
                        in Persia, it will inevitably manifest its repercussions in the West and will rouse
                        the leaders of the Church and finally the civil authorities to challenge the claims
                        and eventually to recognize the independent status of the Religion of Bahá’u’lláh.
                        Nothing whatever in the mean time should be said or done by any one of us, whether
                        in the political field or in our relations with ecclesiastical organizations, that
                        would tend to confuse the issues with which our struggling Cause will sooner or later
                        be confronted. We should accept no position, should avoid any affiliations or commitments
                        that could in any way harm our future position or provide our potential enemies with
                        weapons with which they can resist the complete emancipation of our Cause or retard
                        its ultimate recognition and victory. Though our Cause unreservedly recognizes the
                        Divine origin of all the religions that preceded it and upholds the spiritual truths
                        which lie at their very core and are common to them all, its institutions, whether
                        administrative, religious or humanitarian, must, if their distinctive character is
                        to be maintained and recognized, be increasingly divorced from the outworn creeds,
                        the meaningless ceremonials and man-made institutions with which these religions are
                        at present identified. Our adversaries in the East have initiated the struggle. Our
                        future opponents in the West will, in their turn, arise and carry it a stage further.
                        Ours is the duty, in anticipation of this inevitable contest, to uphold unequivocally
                        and with undivided loyalty the integrity of our Faith and demonstrate the distinguishing
                        features of its divinely appointed institutions.

                        and should be increasingly supported by the entire body of the believers, both in
                        their individual capacities, and through their collective efforts, whether organized
                        as groups or as Local Assemblies. The supply of funds, in support of the national

                        by fresh conquests and unprecedented triumphs in the teaching field within the United
                        States and beyond its confines. A systematic, carefully conceived, and well-established
                        plan should be devised, vigorously pursued and continuously extended. Initiated by
                        the national representatives of the American believers, the vanguard and standard-bearers
                        of the valiant army of Bahá’u’lláh, this plan should receive the wholehearted, the
                        sustained and ever-increasing support, both moral and financial, of the entire body
                        of His followers in that continent. Its supreme immediate objective should be the
                        permanent establishment of at least one center in every state of the American Republic
                        and in every Republic of the American continent not yet enlisted under the banner
                        of His Faith. Its ramifications should gradually be extended to the European continent,
                        and its scope should be made to include those countries, such as the Baltic states,
                        Poland, Greece, Spain and Portugal, where no avowed believer has established any definite
                        residence. The field is immense, the task gigantic, the privilege immeasurably precious.
                        Time is short, and the obligation sacred, paramount and urgent. The American community
                        must muster all its force, concentrate its resources, summon to its aid all the faith,
                        the determination and energies of which it is capable, and set out single-minded and
                        undaunted, to attain still greater heights in its mighty exertions for the Cause of
                        Bahá’u’lláh.

                        wishes of their beloved Master, must intensify their teaching work a thousandfold

                        the most distant outposts of their far-flung Faith. The Tablets of the Divine Plan

                        community has embarked. The promulgation of the Divine Plan, unveiled by our departed
                        Master in the darkest days of one of the severest ordeals which humanity has ever
                        experienced,<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#656673889">18</a></sup> is the Key which Providence has placed in the hands of the American believers whereby
                        to unlock the doors leading them to fulfill their unimaginably glorious Destiny. As
                        the proclamation of the Message reverberates throughout the land, as its resistless
                        march gathers momentum, as the field of its operation widens and the numbers of its
                        upholders and champions multiply, its potentialities will correspondingly unfold,
                        exerting a most beneficent influence, not only on every community throughout the Bahá’í
                        world, but on the immediate fortunes of a travailing society. The repercussions of
                        this campaign are already apparent in Europe, India, Egypt, Iraq and even among the
                        sorely tried communities in Persia and Russia. The Faith of God is gaining in stature,
                        effectiveness and power. Not until, however, the great enterprise which you are now
                        conducting runs its full course and attains its final objective, at its appointed
                        time, can its world-encompassing benefits be fully apprehended or revealed. The perseverance
                        of the American believers will, no doubt, ensure the ultimate realization of these
                        benefits. Praying with undiminished fervor for you all.

                        to prove themselves worthy of the sublimity of their mission, and of their privileged
                        position among their sister communities in both the East and the West. The twofold
                        task they have arisen to perform will, if carried out in time, release the potentialities
                        with which the community of the Greatest Name has been so generously and mysteriously

                        shed on the closing years of this first century of the Bahá’í Era a luster no less
                        brilliant than the immortal deeds which have signalized its birth in the Heroic Age
                        of our Faith. To the American believers, the spiritual descendants of the heroes of
                        God’s Cause, I again address my plea, to arise as one soul and to prosecute, with
                        unrelaxing resolve, the high mission with which their immediate destinies are inextricably
                        interwoven. The call has gone forth, the path is clear, the goal manifest and within
                        their reach. Though their responsibilities be pressing and heavy and the obstacles
                        formidable and manifold, yet the spirit of our invincible Faith will enable them to
                        conquer if they arise unitedly and determinedly and persevere till the very end.

                        <a id="261580372" class="brl-location"></a>To this letter, dealing chiefly with the day-to-day administration of your Assembly’s
                        activities, I wish to add a few observations connected with the wider and more challenging
                        issues with which the American believers as a body are now being confronted. As I
                        lift up my gaze beyond the strain and stresses which a struggling Faith must necessarily
                        experience, and view the wider scene which the indomitable will of the American Bahá’í
                        community is steadily unfolding, I cannot but marvel at the range which the driving
                        force of their ceaseless labors has acquired and the heights which the sublimity of
                        their faith has attained. The outposts of a Faith, already persecuted in both Europe
                        and Asia, are in the American continent steadily advancing, the visible symbols of
                        its undoubted sovereignty are receiving fresh luster every day and its manifold institutions
                        are driving their roots deeper and deeper into its soil. Blest and honored as none
                        among its sister communities has been in recent years, preserved through the inscrutable
                        dispensations of Divine Providence for a destiny which no mind can as yet imagine,
                        such a community cannot for a moment afford to be content with or rest on the laurels
                        it has so deservedly won. It must go on, continually go on, exploring fresh fields,
                        scaling nobler heights, laying firmer foundations, shedding added splendor and achieving
                        further renown in the service and for the glory of the Cause of Bahá’u’lláh. The Seven
                        Year Plan,<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#357677999">26</a></sup> which it has sponsored and with which its destiny is so closely interwoven, must
                        at all costs be prosecuted with increasing force and added consecration. All should
                        arise and participate. Upon the measure of such a participation will no doubt depend
                        the welfare and progress of those distant communities which are now battling for their
                        emancipation. To such a priceless privilege the inheritors of the shining grace of
                        Bahá’u’lláh cannot surely be indifferent. The American believers must gird up the
                        loins of endeavor and step into the arena of service with such heroism as shall astound
                        the entire Bahá’í world. Let them be assured that my prayers will continue to be offered
                        on their behalf.

                        <a id="593374332" class="brl-location"></a>The Seven Year Plan, with which the immediate fortunes of the American Bahá’í community
                        are so closely interwoven, demands, at this critical stage in its development, serious
                        and prayerful consideration of certain vital requirements, without which such a stupendous
                        task can never be brought to a successful completion. The evolution of the Plan imposes
                        a threefold obligation, which all individual believers, all Local Assemblies, as well
                        as the National Assembly itself, must respectively recognize and conscientiously fulfill.
                        Each and every believer, undaunted by the uncertainties, the perils and the financial
                        stringency afflicting the nation, must arise and ensure, to the full measure of his
                        or her capacity, that continuous and abundant flow of funds into the national Treasury,
                        on which the successful prosecution of the Plan must chiefly depend. Upon the Local
                        Assemblies, whose special function and high privilege is to facilitate the admission
                        of new believers into the community, and thereby stimulate the infusion of fresh blood
                        into its organic institutions, a duty no less binding in character devolves. To them
                        I wish particularly to appeal, at this present hour, when the call of God is being
                        raised throughout the length and breadth of both continents in the New World, to desist
                        from insisting too rigidly on the minor observances and beliefs, which might prove
                        a stumbling-block in the way of any sincere applicant, whose eager desire is to enlist
                        under the banner of Bahá’u’lláh. While conscientiously adhering to the fundamental
                        qualifications already laid down, the members of each and every Assembly should endeavor,
                        by their patience, their love, their tact and wisdom, to nurse, subsequent to his
                        admission, the newcomer into Bahá’í maturity, and win him over gradually to the unreserved
                        acceptance of whatever has been ordained in the teachings. As to the National Assembly,
                        whose inescapable responsibility is to guard the integrity, coordinate the activities,
                        and stimulate the life, of the entire community, its chief concern, at the present
                        moment, should be to anxiously deliberate on how best to enable both individual believers
                        and Local Assemblies to fulfill their respective tasks. Through their repeated appeals,
                        through their readiness to dispel all misunderstandings and remove all obstacles,
                        through the example of their lives, their unrelaxing vigilance, their high sense of
                        justice, their humility, consecration and courage, they must demonstrate to those
                        whom they represent their capacity to play their part in the progress of the Plan
                        in which they, no less than the rest of the community, are involved. May the all-conquering
                        Spirit of Bahá’u’lláh be so infused into each component part of this harmoniously
                        functioning System as to enable it to contribute its proper share to the consummation
                        of the Plan.

                        vigor and noble enthusiasm by the American Bahá’í community. For no less than six
                        consecutive years this twofold and stupendous enterprise, which has been set in operation,
                        must, if the American believers are to prove themselves worthy of their high calling,
                        be wisely conducted, continually reinforced and energetically prosecuted to its very
                        end. Severe and unprecedented as may be the internal tests and ordeals which the members
                        of this community may yet experience, however tragic and momentous the external happenings
                        which might well disrupt the fabric of the society in which they live, they must not,
                        throughout these six remaining years, allow themselves to be deflected from the course
                        they are now steadily pursuing. Nay rather, as the impelling forces which have set
                        in motion this mighty undertaking acquire added momentum and its potentialities are
                        more fully manifested, they who are responsible for its success must as time goes
                        on evince a more burning enthusiasm, demonstrate a higher sense of solidarity, reveal
                        greater depths of consecration to their task, and display a more unyielding determination
                        to achieve its purpose. Then and only then will the pleas, the hopes and the wishes
                        of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, eternally enshrined in the Tablets of the Divine Plan, be worthily
                        acknowledged and fulfilled. “<span class="brl-italic">Let your exertions henceforth increase a thousandfold</span>” is the earnest appeal voiced by Him in those Tablets. “<span class="brl-italic">Summon the people,</span>” He exhorts them, “<span class="brl-italic">in these countries, capitals, islands, assemblies and churches to enter the Abhá Kingdom.
                           The scope of your exertions must needs be extended. The wider its range, the more
                           striking will be the evidence of divine assistance.</span>” “<span class="brl-italic">The moment,</span>” He solemnly affirms, “<span class="brl-italic">this divine Message is carried forward by the American believers from the shores of
                           America and is propagated through the continents of Europe, of Asia, of Africa and
                           of Australasia … this community will find itself securely established upon the throne
                           of an everlasting dominion.… Then will the whole earth resound with the praises of
                           its majesty and greatness.</span>” The Seven Year Plan, to which every American believer is fully and irrevocably pledged,
                        during the closing years of the First century of the Bahá’í Era, is in itself but
                        an initial stage in the unfoldment of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s vision of America’s spiritual
                        destiny—a destiny which only those who will have successfully accomplished this preliminary
                        task can enable the rising generations who will labor after them to fulfill in the
                        course of the succeeding century.

                        cable to your Assembly, at the new spirit of alertness and determination which you
                        have so clearly demonstrated while yet on the threshold of your year of stewardship
                        in the service of the Cause of Bahá’u’lláh. I am filled with fresh hopes, and yearn
                        to witness, ere the present year draws to a close, not only the fulfillment of an
                        unexampled record of service but the revelation of such depths of consecration as
                        will astonish, nay thrill, both the members of your own community and the rest of
                        the Bahá’í world. Pregnant indeed are the years looming ahead of us all. The twin
                        processes of internal disintegration and external chaos are being accelerated every
                        day and are inexorably moving towards a climax. The rumblings that must precede the
                        eruption of those forces that must cause “the limbs of humanity to quake” can already
                        be heard. “The time of the end,” “the latter years,” as foretold in the Scriptures,
                        are at long last upon us. The Pen of Bahá’u’lláh, the voice of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, have
                        time and again, insistently and in terms unmistakable, warned an unheeding humanity
                        of impending disaster. The Community of the Most Great Name, the leaven that must
                        leaven the lump, the chosen remnant that must survive the rolling up of the old, discredited,
                        tottering Order and assist in the unfoldment of a new one in its stead, is standing
                        ready, alert, clear-visioned, and resolute. The American believers, standard-bearers
                        of this worldwide community and torchbearers of an as yet unborn civilization, have
                        girt up their loins, unfurled their banners and stepped into the arena of service.
                        Their Plan has been formulated. Their forces are mobilized. They are steadfastly marching
                        towards their goal. They cannot afford either to turn back or hesitate. The hosts
                        of the Abhá Kingdom are rushing forth, as promised, to direct their steps and reinforce
                        their power. Through their initial victories they have provided the impulse that must
                        now surge and, with relentless force, sweep over their sister-communities and eventually
                        overpower the entire human race. The generality of mankind, blind and enslaved, is
                        wholly unaware of the healing power with which this community has been endowed, nor
                        can it as yet suspect the role which this same community is destined to play in its
                        redemption. Fierce and manifold will be the assaults with which governments, races,
                        classes and religions, jealous of its rising prestige and fearful of its consolidating
                        strength, will seek to silence its voice and sap its foundations. Unmoved by the relative
                        obscurity that surrounds it at the present time, and undaunted by the forces that
                        will be arrayed against it in the future, this community, I cannot but feel confident,
                        will, no matter how afflictive the agonies of a travailing age, pursue its destiny,
                        undeflected in its course, undimmed in its serenity, unyielding in its resolve, unshaken
                        in its convictions.

                        solidarity and unquenchable enthusiasm that distinguish every stage in the progressive
                        development of the nationwide enterprise which is being so unflinchingly pursued by
                        the whole American Bahá’í community. The marked deterioration in world affairs, the
                        steadily deepening gloom that envelops the storm-tossed peoples and nations of the
                        Old World, invest the Seven Year Plan, now operating in both the North and South American
                        continents, with a significance and urgency that cannot be overestimated. Conceived
                        as the supreme agency for the establishment, in the opening century of the Bahá’í
                        Era, of what is but the initial stage in the progressive realization of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s
                        Plan for the American believers, this enterprise, as it extends its ramifications
                        throughout the entire New World, is demonstrating its power to command all the resources
                        and utilize all the facilities which the machinery of a laboriously evolved Administrative
                        Order can place at its disposal. However we view its aspects, it offers in its functioning
                        a sharp contrast to the workings of the moribund and obsolescent institutions to which
                        a perverse generation is desperately clinging. Tempestuous are the winds that buffet
                        and will, as the days go by, fiercely assail the very structure of the Order through
                        the agency of which this twofold task is being performed. The potentialities with
                        which an almighty Providence has endowed it will no doubt enable its promoters to
                        achieve their purpose. Much, however, will depend upon the spirit and manner in which
                        that task will be conducted. Through the clearness and steadiness of their vision,
                        through the unvitiated vitality of their belief, through the incorruptibility of their
                        character, through the adamantine force of their resolve, the matchless superiority
                        of their aims and purpose, and the unsurpassed range of their accomplishments, they
                        who labor for the glory of the Most Great Name throughout both Americas can best demonstrate
                        to the visionless, faithless, and restless society to which they belong their power
                        to proffer a haven of refuge to its members in the hour of their realized doom. Then
                        and only then will this tender sapling, embedded in the fertile soil of a Divinely
                        appointed Administrative Order, and energized by the dynamic processes of its institutions,
                        yield its richest and destined fruit. That the community of the American believers,
                        to whose keeping so vast, so delicate and precious a trust has been committed, will,

                        <a id="490422631" class="brl-location"></a>I have, in a recent cable addressed to your Assembly, felt it necessary to stress
                        the paramount need of maintaining the proper balance between the Temple construction
                        work and the teaching activities which have been initiated and are being so energetically
                        conducted under your direction in accordance with the Seven Year Plan. The twofold
                        aim you are now pursuing should at no time become obscured, nor should either one
                        of the dual responsibilities you have assumed be allowed to preponderate over the
                        other. The urgency of the task connected with the ornamentation of the Ma<u>sh</u>riqu’l-A<u>dh</u>kár has been rightly recognized, and its immediate needs have been generously and
                        promptly met. A similar, nay a mightier, effort should now be deliberately and persistently
                        exerted in the field of pioneer teaching, in both the United States and Canada. Every
                        facility and encouragement, moral and material, should be extended to the National
                        Teaching Committee and its auxiliary agencies to ensure the speedy termination of
                        the first stage in the teaching campaign to which every American believer is now pledged.
                     </p>

                        <a id="495914890" class="brl-location"></a>Very soon we shall be entering the second half of the last decade of this, the first
                        century of the Bahá’í Era. The five remaining years should essentially be consecrated
                        to the imperative, the spiritual needs of the remaining republics of both Central
                        and South America, for whose entry into the fellowship of Bahá’u’lláh the Plan was
                        primarily formulated. The prime requisite for the definite opening of what may come
                        to be regarded as one of the most brilliant chapters in American Bahá’í history is
                        the completion of the initial task which American Bahá’í pioneers must perform in
                        the nine remaining states and provinces as yet unassociated with the organic structure
                        of the Faith.
                     </p>

                        <a id="143045555" class="brl-location"></a>The period ahead is short, strenuous, fraught with mortal perils for human society,
                        yet pregnant with possibilities of unsurpassed triumphs for the power of Bahá’u’lláh’s
                        redemptive Cause. The occasion is propitious for a display, by the American Bahá’í
                        Community, in its corporate capacity, of an effort which in its magnitude, character,
                        and purpose must outshine its past endeavors. Failure to exploit these present, these
                        golden opportunities would blast the hopes which the prosecution of the Plan has thus
                        far aroused, and would signify the loss of the rarest privilege ever conferred by
                        Providence upon the American Bahá’í Community. It is in view of the criticalness of
                        the situation that I was led to place at the disposal of any pioneer willing to dedicate
                        himself to the task of the present hour such modest resources as would facilitate
                        the discharge of so enviable a duty.

                        <a id="908366219" class="brl-location"></a>The Bahá’í world, increasingly subjected to the rigors of repression, in both the
                        East and the West, watches with unconcealed astonishment, and derives hope and comfort
                        from, the rapid unfoldment of the successive stages of God’s Plan for so blest a community.
                        Its eyes are fixed upon this community, eager to behold the manner in which its gallant
                        members will break down, one after another, the barriers that obstruct their progress
                        towards a divinely appointed goal. On every daring adventurer in the service of the
                        Cause of Bahá’u’lláh the Concourse on high shall descend, “<span class="brl-italic">each bearing aloft a chalice of pure light.</span>” Every one of these adventurers God Himself will sustain and inspire, and will “<span class="brl-italic">cause the pure waters of wisdom and utterance to gush out and flow copiously from
                           his heart.</span>” “<span class="brl-italic">The Kingdom of God,</span>” writes ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, “<span class="brl-italic">is possessed of limitless potency. Audacious must be the army of life if the confirming
                           aid of that Kingdom is to be repeatedly vouchsafed unto it … Vast is the arena, and
                           the time ripe to spur on the charger within it. Now is the time to reveal the force
                           of one’s strength, the stoutness of one’s heart and the might of one’s soul.</span>”

                        at hand, and waiting to receive, at this very hour, their full share of the onrushing
                        tide of Bahá’u’lláh’s redeeming grace? What theater more befitting than these long-neglected
                        nine remaining states and provinces in which the true heroism of the intrepid pioneers
                        of His World Order can be displayed? There is no time to lose. There is no room left
                        for vacillation. Multitudes hunger for the Bread of Life. The stage is set. The firm
                        and irrevocable Promise is given. God’s own Plan has been set in motion. It is gathering
                        momentum with every passing day. The powers of heaven and earth mysteriously assist
                        in its execution. Such an opportunity is irreplaceable. Let the doubter arise, and
                        himself verify the truth of such assertions. To try, to persevere, is to ensure ultimate
                        and complete victory.

                        The illustrious community of the American believers, contemptuous of risk or peril,
                        is driving ahead, relentlessly and with its whole vigor, towards the dual goal which
                        the Seven Year Plan has set before it. The virtual completion of the contract for
                        the gallery section of the Ma<u>sh</u>riqu’l-A<u>dh</u>kár, the inauguration of the First Story Construction Fund, the signature of the contract

                        the resultant penetration of the Faith into practically every state and province in
                        the United States and Canada—all these have, in the course of the second year of the
                        Seven Year Plan, followed in amazingly swift succession. With dramatic swiftness,
                        with unyielding resolve, with uncompromising fidelity and superb courage, the community
                        responsible for such a unique demonstration of Bahá’í initiative and enterprise is

                        whole of Latin America is now in full swing and is being rapidly carried out. A further
                        step, designed to hasten the conclusion of the final phase of the ornamentation of
                        the Temple, has also been taken. As the days roll by, as the perturbations of an imperiled
                        civilization are more alarmingly manifested, the potentialities of God’s creative
                        Plan correspondingly unfold, and the valor and heroism of its intrepid supporters
                        are more widely and convincingly demonstrated. With every successful effort to muster
                        its young and scattered forces, to perfect its methods, to extend the range of its
                        operations, to deepen its spiritual life and to scale loftier heights of individual
                        heroism, there will, I cannot but feel confident, be granted to this community a greater
                        opportunity to prove its worth, and a fuller measure of celestial strength to enable
                        it to re-enact, on the soil of the United States and Canada and throughout the entire
                        Western Hemisphere, those stirring exploits that have shed such luster on the Apostolic
                        Age of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh. Though much has thus far been achieved, yet the processes
                        now set in motion through the evolution of the Plan are still far too rudimentary
                        to permit even a faint glimpse of the brilliancy of the epoch in which ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s
                        own Plan must come to fruition. Not ours to attempt, at the present moment, a survey
                        of the distant scene, or to seek to visualize its glories, or to dwell on the consequences
                        of the eventual attainment of an as yet far-off goal. Ours is the solemn, the inescapable
                        duty to labor faithfully and unremittingly to ensure that no opportunity is being
                        missed, that no avenues are left unexplored, that might, however indirectly, contribute
                        to the furtherance of those tasks that claim so insistently our immediate attention.
                        That those into whose hands this dynamic Plan has been entrusted are aware of the
                        essential character of their obligations and will discharge worthily their duties
                        no one, viewing the range and quality of their achievements, can entertain the slightest
                        doubt.

                        <a id="936034194" class="brl-location"></a>I have in two recent successive messages, cabled to your Assembly, given expression,
                        as far as it lay in my power, to the feelings of overflowing gratitude which the response
                        of so many pioneers to the call of teaching has evoked in my heart. I have moreover
                        felt impelled to convey my congratulations to the members of your Assembly, who, through
                        their resource, unity and single-mindedness, have lent so needed and timely an impetus
                        to the mighty work associated with the second year of the Seven Year Plan. There can
                        be no doubt whatever that what the American believers, no less than their elected
                        national representatives, have accomplished, the long and assiduous care of the former
                        and the potent methods employed by the latter have witnessed to the uprising of a
                        new spirit on which the defamers of the Cause may well pause to reflect, and from
                        which its lovers cannot but derive deep joy and solace. I again wish to thank with
                        all my soul those whose acts have stirred the imagination of friend and foe alike.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="265354801" class="brl-location"></a>In my desire not to omit anything that might help to spur on or reinforce the community
                        of the American believers as they move on to their destiny, I feel it necessary to
                        add a word of warning in connection with the work that has been so splendidly begun
                        lest it should be jeopardized or frustrated. The initial phase of the teaching work
                        operating under the Seven Year Plan has at long last been concluded. They who have
                        pushed it forward have withstood the test gloriously. By their acts, whether as teachers
                        or administrators, they have written a glorious page in the struggle for the laying
                        of a continent-wide foundation for the Administrative Order of their Faith. At this
                        advanced stage in the fulfillment of the purpose to which they have set their hand,
                        there can be no turning back, no halting, no respite. To launch the bark of the Faith,
                        to implant its banner, is not enough. Support, ample, organized and unremitting, should
                        be lent, designed to direct the course of that bark and to lay an unassailable foundation
                        for the fort destined to stand guard over that banner.
                     </p>

                        <a id="745724121" class="brl-location"></a>The National Spiritual Assembly, the National Teaching Committee, the Regional and
                        Local Teaching Committees, no less than the itinerant teachers, should utilize every
                        possible means calculated to fan the zeal, enrich the resources, and ensure the solidity
                        and permanency of the work, of those who, actuated by so laudable and shining a spirit
                        of self-sacrifice, have arisen to face the hazards and perils of so holy and historic
                        an adventure. Indeed every believer, however humble and inexperienced, should sense
                        the obligation to play his or her part in a mission that involves so very deeply the
                        destinies not only of the American Bahá’í community but of the nation itself.

                        <a id="224958846" class="brl-location"></a>The concerted activities of the followers of Bahá’u’lláh in the North American continent
                        assume, as they multiply and develop, a dual aspect, and may be said to fall into
                        two distinct categories, both equally vital and complementary to each other. The one
                        aims at the safeguarding and consolidation of the work already achieved; the other
                        is designed to enlarge the range of its operation. The former depends chiefly for
                        its success upon the capacity, the experience, and the loyalty of wise, resourceful,
                        and judicious administrators who, impelled by the very nature of their task, will
                        be increasingly called upon to exercise the utmost care and vigilance in protecting
                        the interests of the Faith, in resolving its problems, in regulating its life, in
                        enriching its resources, and in preserving the pristine purity of its precepts. The
                        latter is essentially pioneer in nature, demanding first and foremost those qualities
                        of renunciation, tenacity, dauntlessness and passionate fervor that can alone brave
                        the dangers and sweep away the obstacles with which an infant Faith, struggling against
                        vested interests and face to face with the entrenched forces of prejudice, of ignorance
                        and fanaticism, must needs contend. In both of these spheres of Bahá’í activity the
                        community of the American believers, it is becoming increasingly evident, is evincing
                        those characteristics which must be regarded as the essential foundation for the success
                        of their dual task.

                        <a id="570236369" class="brl-location"></a>As to those whose function is essentially of an administrative character it can hardly
                        be doubted that they are, steadily and indefatigably, perfecting the structural machinery
                        of their Faith, are multiplying its administrative agencies and are legalizing the
                        status of its newly established institutions. Slowly and patiently they are canalizing
                        the spirit that at once directs, energizes and safeguards its operation. They are
                        exploiting its potentialities, broadcasting its message, publicizing its literature,
                        fostering the aspirations of its youth, devising ways and means for the training of
                        its children, guarding the integrity of its teachings, and paving the way for the
                        ultimate codification of its laws. Through all the resources at their disposal they
                        are promoting the growth and consolidation of that pioneer movement for which the
                        entire machinery of their Administrative Order has been primarily designed and erected.
                        They are visibly and progressively contributing to the enrichment of their unique
                        community life, and are ensuring, with magnificent courage and characteristic promptitude,
                        the completion of their consecrated Edifice—the embodiment of their hopes and the
                        supreme symbol of their ideals.

                        is to think himself debarred from joining their ranks—the standards of a forward-marching
                        Faith have been entrusted, they too with no less zest and thoroughness are pushing
                        farther and farther its frontiers, breaking new soil, establishing fresh outposts,
                        winning more recruits, and contributing to the greater diversification and more harmonious
                        blending of the elements comprised in the worldwide society of its followers.

                        Bahá’u’lláh has envisioned, and whose features ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, its Architect, has delineated,
                        we, whatever our capacities, opportunities or position, are now, at so precarious
                        a period in the world’s history, summoned to found and erect. The community of the
                        Most Great Name in the Western Hemisphere is, through the nature of its corporate
                        life and the scope of its exertions, assuming, beyond the shadow of a doubt, a preponderating
                        share in the laying of such a foundation and the erection of such a structure. The
                        eyes of its sister communities are fixed upon it. Their prayers ascend on its behalf.
                        Their hands are outstretched to lend whatever aid lies within their power. I, for
                        my part, am determined to reinforce the impulse that impels its members forward to
                        meet their destiny. The Founders of their Faith survey from the Kingdom on high the
                        range of their achievements, acclaim their progress, and are ever ready to speed their
                        eventual triumph.

                        one moment overlook the urgency and gravity of the times in which they are laboring.
                        Nor do I wish to minimize the hazards and trials that surround or lie ahead of them.
                        The grandeur of their task is indeed commensurate with the mortal perils by which
                        their generation is hemmed in. As the dusk creeps over a steadily sinking society
                        the radiant outlines of their redemptive mission become sharper every day. The present
                        world unrest, symptom of a worldwide malady, their world religion has already affirmed,
                        must needs culminate in that world catastrophe out of which the consciousness of world
                        citizenship will be born, a consciousness that can alone provide an adequate basis
                        for the organization of world unity, on which a lasting world peace must necessarily
                        depend, the peace itself inaugurating in turn that world civilization which will mark
                        the coming of age of the entire human race.

                        of present-day civilization, will, I feel convinced, prove themselves, through their

                        each one of your brethren in the Faith throughout the United States and Canada, who
                        are witnessing, from day to day and at an ever-hastening speed, the approaching completion
                        of their national House of Worship, the great Mother Temple of the West, your resolution
                        to establish within its hallowed precincts and in the heart of the North American
                        continent the Administrative Seat of their beloved Faith cannot but denote henceforward
                        a closer association, a more constant communion, and a higher degree of coordination
                        between the two primary agencies providentially ordained for the enrichment of their
                        spiritual life and for the conduct and regulation of their administrative affairs.
                        To the far-flung Bahá’í communities of East and West, most of which are being increasingly
                        proscribed and ill treated, and none of which can claim to have had a share of the
                        dual blessings which a specially designed and constructed House of Worship and a fully
                        and efficiently functioning Administrative Order invariably confer, the concentration
                        in a single locality of what will come to be regarded as the fountainhead of the community’s
                        spiritual life and what is already recognized as the mainspring of its administrative
                        activities signalizes the launching of yet another phase in the slow and imperceptible
                        emergence, in these declining times, of the model Bahá’í community—a community divinely
                        ordained, organically united, clear-visioned, vibrant with life, and whose very purpose
                        is regulated by the twin directing principles of the worship of God and of service
                        to one’s fellowmen.

                        of your allotted term of stewardship in service to the Cause of Bahá’u’lláh. Moreover,
                        it significantly coincides with the inauguration of that world Mission of which the

                        has been but a prelude. That such a decision may speedily and without the slightest
                        hitch be carried into effect is the deepest longing of my heart. That those who have
                        boldly carried so weighty a resolution may without pause or respite continue to labor
                        and build up, as circumstances permit, around this administrative nucleus such accessories
                        as the machinery of a fast-evolving Administrative Order, functioning under the shadow
                        of, and in such close proximity to, the Ma<u>sh</u>riqu’l-A<u>dh</u>kár, must demand is the object of my incessant and fervent prayer. That such a step,
                        momentous as it is, may prove the starting-point for acts of still greater renown
                        and of richer possibilities that will leave their distinct mark on the third year
                        of the Seven Year Plan is a hope which I, together with all those who are eagerly
                        following its progress, fondly and confidently cherish.

                        task, must simultaneously brace themselves for another sublime effort to discharge,
                        ere the present year draws to a close, their manifold responsibilities allotted to
                        them under the Seven Year Plan. The placing of yet another contract for the casting
                        of the ornamentation of the first story of the Temple, the permanent settlement of
                        the six remaining Republics of Central America, and the extension of continual support,
                        both material and moral, to those weaker states, provinces, and Republics that have
                        been recently incorporated in the body of the Faith, combine to offer, at this hour
                        when the fate of civilization trembles in the balance, the boldest and gravest challenge
                        that has ever faced the community of the American believers both in the propagative
                        and administrative spheres of Bahá’í activity. In the field of pioneer teaching, and
                        particularly in connection with the opening of the Republics of Haiti, Salvador, Costa
                        Rica, Nicaragua, Dominica and Guatemala, the utmost encouragement should at all times
                        be vouchsafed by the elected representatives of the community to those who, out of
                        the abundance of their hearts, and in direct response to the call of their Faith and
                        the dictates of their conscience, have renounced their comforts, fled their homes,
                        and hazarded their fortunes, for the sake of bringing into operation the majestic
                        Plan of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, while special support should be extended to those who appear
                        to be best qualified for the strenuous labors which pioneering under such exacting
                        circumstances demands. Care should be exercised lest any hindrance should for any
                        reason be placed in the way of those who have, whether young or old, rich or poor,
                        so spontaneously dedicated themselves to so urgent and holy a mission.

                        members of the American Bahá’í community, at this, the most fateful hour in their
                        history. The first is the voice, distant and piteous, of those sister communities
                        which now, alas, are fettered by the galling chains of religious orthodoxy and isolated
                        through the cruel barriers set up by a rampant nationalism. The second is the plea,
                        no less vehement and equally urgent, of those peoples and nations of the New World,
                        whose vast and unexplored territories await to be warmed by the light and swept into
                        the orbit of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh. The third, more universal and stirring than
                        either of the others, is the call of humanity itself crying out for deliverance at
                        a time when the tide of mounting evils has destroyed its equilibrium and is now strangling
                        its very life.

                        <a id="249530410" class="brl-location"></a>These imperative calls of Bahá’í duty the American believers can immediately if only
                        partially answer. Their present status, their circumscribed resources, debar them,
                        however great their eagerness, from responding completely and decisively to the full
                        implications of this threefold obligation. They can neither, individually nor through
                        their concerted efforts, impose directly their will upon those into whose hands the
                        immediate destinies of their persecuted brethren are placed. Nor are they as yet capable
                        of launching a campaign of such magnitude as could capture the imagination and arouse
                        the conscience of mankind, and thereby ensure the immediate and full redress of those
                        grievances from which their hapless co-religionists in both the East and the West
                        are suffering. They cannot moreover hope to wield at the present time in the councils
                        of nations an influence commensurate with the stupendous claims advanced, or adequate
                        to the greatness of the Cause proclaimed, by the Author of their Faith. Nor can they
                        assume a position or exercise such responsibilities as would enable them by their
                        acts and decisions to reverse the process which is urging so tragically the decline
                        of human society and its institutions.

                        conferred authority unrecognized, the role they can play in both alleviating the hardships
                        that afflict their brethren and in attenuating the ills that torment mankind is none
                        the less considerable and far-reaching. By the range and liberality of their contributions
                        to mitigate the distress of the bereaved, the exiled, and the imprisoned; by the persistent,
                        the wise and judicious intervention of their elected representatives through the authorities
                        concerned; by a clear and convincing exposition, whenever circumstances are propitious,
                        of the issues involved; by a vigorous defense of the rights and liberties denied;
                        by an accurate and dignified presentation of the events that have transpired; by every
                        manner of encouragement which their sympathies may suggest, or their means permit,
                        or their consciences dictate, to succor the outcast and the impoverished; and above
                        all by their tenacious adherence to, and wide proclamation of, those principles, laws,
                        ideals, and institutions which their disabled fellow believers are unable to affirm
                        or publicly espouse; and lastly by the energetic prosecution of those tasks which
                        their oppressed fellow workers are forbidden to initiate or conduct, the privileged
                        community of the American Bahá’ís can play a conspicuous part in the great Drama involving
                        so large a company of their unemancipated brethren in the Asiatic, the European and
                        African continents.<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#586091658">38</a></sup>

                        <a id="801819090" class="brl-location"></a>Their duties towards mankind in general are no less distinct and vital. Their impotence
                        to stem the tide of onrushing calamities, their seeming helplessness in face of those
                        cataclysmic forces that are to convulse human society, do not in the least detract
                        from the urgency of their unique mission, nor exonerate them from those weighty responsibilities
                        which they alone can and must assume. Humanity, heedless and impenitent, is admittedly
                        hovering on the edge of an awful abyss, ready to precipitate itself into that titanic
                        struggle, that crucible whose chastening fires alone can and will weld its antagonistic
                        elements of race, class, religion and nation into one coherent system, one world Commonwealth.
                        “<span class="brl-italic">The hour is approaching,</span>” is Bahá’u’lláh’s own testimony, “<span class="brl-italic">when the most great convulsion will have appeared.… I swear by God! The promised day
                           is come, the day when tormenting trials will have surged above your heads, and beneath
                           your feet, saying: ‘Taste ye what your hands have wrought!’</span>” Not ours to question the almighty wisdom, or fathom the inscrutable ways of Him
                        in Whose hands the ultimate destiny of an unregenerate yet potentially glorious race
                        must lie. Ours rather is the duty to believe that the worldwide community of the Most
                        Great Name, and in particular at the present time its vanguard in North America, however
                        buffeted by the powerful currents of these troublous times, and however keen their
                        awareness of the inevitability of the final eruption, can, if they will, rise to the
                        level of their calling and discharge their functions, both in the period which is
                        witnessing the confusion and breakdown of human institutions and in the ensuing epoch
                        during which the shattered basis of a dismembered society is to be recast, and its
                        forces reshaped, redirected and unified. With the age that is still unborn, with its
                        herculean tasks and unsuspected glories, we need not concern ourselves at present.
                        It is to the fierce struggles, the imperious duties, the distinctive contributions
                        which the present generation of Bahá’ís are summoned to undertake and render that
                        I feel we should, at this hour, direct our immediate and anxious attention. Though
                        powerless to avert the impending contest the followers of Bahá’u’lláh can, by the
                        spirit they evince and the efforts they exert, help to circumscribe its range, shorten
                        its duration, allay its hardships, proclaim its salutary consequences, and demonstrate
                        its necessary and vital role in the shaping of human destiny. Theirs is the duty to
                        hold, aloft and undimmed, the torch of Divine Guidance, as the shades of night descend
                        upon, and ultimately envelop the entire human race. Theirs is the function, amidst
                        its tumults, perils and agonies, to witness to the vision, and proclaim the approach,
                        of that re-created society, that Christ-promised Kingdom, that World Order whose generative
                        impulse is the spirit of none other than Bahá’u’lláh Himself, whose dominion is the
                        entire planet, whose watchword is unity, whose animating power is the force of Justice,
                        whose directive purpose is the reign of righteousness and truth, and whose supreme
                        glory is the complete, the undisturbed, and everlasting felicity of the whole of humankind.
                        By the sublimity and serenity of their faith, by the steadiness and clarity of their
                        vision, the incorruptibility of their character, the rigor of their discipline, the
                        sanctity of their morals, and the unique example of their community life, they can
                        and indeed must in a world polluted with its incurable corruptions, paralyzed by its
                        haunting fears, torn by its devastating hatreds, and languishing under the weight
                        of its appalling miseries, demonstrate the validity of their claim to be regarded
                        as the sole repository of that grace upon whose operation must depend the complete
                        deliverance, the fundamental reorganization and the supreme felicity of all mankind.

                        to speedily rehabilitate the fortunes of their fellowmen on the other, be in the main
                        insurmountable, such impediments cannot as yet be said to exist that can frustrate

                        the Eastern and Western Hemispheres. Their immediate task under the Seven Year Plan,
                        the object of which is the establishment of a minimum of one Bahá’í center in each
                        of the Republics of Middle and South America, has now been gloriously ushered in through
                        the settlement of one pioneer in most of the Central American Republics, and bids
                        fair to be recognized by posterity as the original impulse imparted to an enterprise
                        that will go round the world. That impulse must, as time goes by, communicate itself
                        to the farthest extremities of Latin America, and must be reinforced, in every manner,
                        by as many of the American believers as possible. The broader the basis of this campaign
                        and the deeper its roots, the finer the flower into which it shall eventually blossom.
                        That its call may be heeded, that its implications may be recognized and its potentialities
                        progressively unfold is my earnest prayer, and the supreme longing of my heart.

                        that pious and holy youth, who in the darkest days of Bahá’u’lláh’s incarceration
                        in the barracks of ‘Akká entreated, on his deathbed, his Father to accept him as a

                        presence, and the saintly mother of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, surnamed Navváb by Bahá’u’lláh,

                        separated in death above half a century, and forced to suffer the humiliation of an
                        alien burial ground, are now at long last reunited with the Greatest Holy Leaf, with
                        whom they had so abundantly shared the tribulations of one of the most distressing
                        episodes of the Heroic Age of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh. Avenged, eternally safeguarded,
                        befittingly glorified, they repose embosomed in the heart of Carmel, hidden beneath
                        its sacred soil, interred in one single spot, lying beneath the shadow of the twin
                        holy Tombs, and facing across the bay, on an eminence of unequaled loveliness and
                        beauty, the silver-city of ‘Akká, the Point of Adoration of the entire Bahá’í world,
                        and the Door of Hope for all mankind. “<span class="brl-italic">Haste thee, O Carmel,</span>” thus proclaims the pen of Bahá’u’lláh, “<span class="brl-italic">for lo, the light of the countenance of God, the Ruler of the Kingdom of Names and
                           Fashioner of the heavens, hath been lifted upon thee.</span>” “<span class="brl-italic">Rejoice, for God hath in this Day established upon thee His throne, hath made thee

                        clear and double violation of the civil law of the land and of the spiritual ordinances
                        of Bahá’u’lláh, in Whose Faith she professes to believe.

                        has borne witness not only to the exalted station of one whose “seed shall inherit
                        the Gentiles,” whose Husband is the Lord of Hosts, but also to the sufferings endured
                        by her who was His beloved mother. “<span class="brl-italic">As to thy question concerning the 54th chapter of Isaiah,” He writes, “This chapter
                           refers to the Most Exalted Leaf, the mother of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. As a proof to this it
                           is said: ‘For more are the children of the desolate, than the children of the married
                           wife.’ Reflect upon this statement, and then upon the following: ‘And thy seed shall
                           inherit the Gentiles, and make the desolate cities to be inhabited.’ And truly the
                           humiliation and reproach which she suffered in the path of God is a fact which no
                           one can refute. For the calamities and afflictions mentioned in the whole chapter
                           are such afflictions which she suffered in the path of God, all of which she endured
                           with patience and thanked God therefor and praised Him, because He had enabled her
                           to endure afflictions for the sake of Bahá. During all this time, the men and women
                           (Covenant-breakers) persecuted her in an incomparable manner, while she was patient,
                           God-fearing, calm, humble and contented through the favor of her Lord and by the bounty
                           of her Creator.</span>”

                        mother, recently reinterred under the shadow of the Báb’s holy Shrine, inaugurates
                        a new, and at long last the final, phase of an enterprise which, thirty years ago,
                        was providentially launched on the very day the remains of the Forerunner of our Faith
                        were laid to rest by our beloved Master in the sepulcher specifically erected for
                        that purpose on Mount Carmel.<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#964025327">45</a></sup> The birth of this holy enterprise, pregnant with such rich, such infinite possibilities,
                        synchronized with, and was consecrated through, this historic event which, as ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
                        Himself has affirmed, constitutes the most signal act of the triple mission He had
                        been prompted to perform. The site of the Temple itself was honored by the presence
                        of Him Who, ever since this enterprise was initiated, had, through His messages and
                        Tablets, bestowed upon it His special attention and care, and surrounded it with the
                        marks of His unfailing solicitude. Its foundation-stone was laid by His own loving
                        hands, on an occasion so moving that it has come to be regarded as one of the most
                        stirring episodes of His historic visit to the North American continent.<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#414020312">46</a></sup> Its superstructure was raised as a direct consequence of the pent-up energies which
                        surged from the breasts of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s lovers at a time when His sudden removal
                        from their midst had plunged them into consternation, bewilderment and sorrow. Its
                        external ornamentation was initiated and accelerated through the energizing influences
                        which the rising and continually consolidating institutions of a divinely established
                        Administrative Order had released in the midst of a community that had identified
                        its vital interests with that Temple’s destiny. The measures devised to hasten its
                        completion were incorporated in a Plan which derives its inspiration from those destiny-shaping
                        Tablets wherein, in bold relief, stands outlined the world mission entrusted by their
                        Author to the American Bahá’í community. And finally, the Fund, designed to receive
                        and dispose of the resources amassed for its prosecution, was linked with the memory,
                        and bore the name, of her whose ebbing life was brightened and cheered by those tidings
                        that unmistakably revealed to her the depth of devotion and the tenacity of purpose
                        which animate the American believers in the cause of their beloved Temple. And now,
                        while the Bahá’í world vibrates with emotion at the news of the transfer of the precious
                        remains of both the Purest Branch and of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s mother to a spot which, watched
                        over by the Twin holy Shrines and in the close neighborhood of the resting-place of
                        the Greatest Holy Leaf, is to become the focus of the administrative institutions
                        of the Faith at its world center, the mere act of linking the destiny of so far-reaching
                        an undertaking with so significant an event in the Formative Period of our Faith will
                        assuredly set the seal of complete triumph upon, and enhance the spiritual potentialities
                        of, a work so significantly started and so magnificently executed by the followers
                        of Bahá’u’lláh in the North American continent.

                        by next April, which will enable you to place the necessary contract for the final
                        completion of the entire First Story of the Mashriqu’l-A<u>dh</u>kár, meets with my unqualified approval. It was specially in order to initiate and
                        encourage the progress of such a plan that I felt impelled to pledge the sum of one
                        thousand pounds in the memory of these two glorious souls who, apart from the Founders
                        of our Faith and its Exemplar, tower, together with the Greatest Holy Leaf, above
                        the rank and file of the faithful.

                        which lie dormant in the international field may, ere the expiry of these fleeting
                        months, break out in an eruption that may prove the most fateful that mankind has
                        experienced. It is within the power of the organized body of the American believers
                        to further demonstrate the imperturbability of their faith, the serenity of their
                        confidence and the unyielding tenacity of their resolve.

                        <a id="239910368" class="brl-location"></a>We stand at the threshold of the decade within which the centenary of the birth of
                        our Faith is to be celebrated. Scarcely more than four years stand between us and
                        that glorious consummation. No community, no individual, neither in the East nor in
                        the West, however afflictive the circumstances that now prevail, can afford to hesitate
                        or falter. The few years immediately ahead are endowed with potencies that we can
                        but dimly appreciate. Ours is the duty and privilege to utilize to the full the opportunities
                        which these fate-laden years offer us. The American Bahá’í community, already responsible,
                        over such a long period, for such heroic acts, under such severe handicaps, cannot
                        and will not hesitate or falter. The past is a witness of their splendid triumphs.
                        The future will be no less a witness of their final victory.

                        are at once critical, challenging, and unprecedented in their significance. The year
                        that has passed has, insofar as the rise and establishment of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh
                        in the Western Hemisphere is concerned, been one of the most eventful since the Plan
                        began to operate and exercise its potent and beneficent influence. Both within and
                        without the community of the Most Great Name, the events which the last twelvemonth
                        has unfolded have in some mysterious way, whether directly or indirectly, communicated
                        their force to the Plan’s progressive unfoldment, contributed to the orientation of
                        its policy and assisted in the consolidation of the diversified undertakings, both
                        primary and subsidiary, that fall within its orbit. Even the losses which the ranks
                        of its stouthearted upholders have sustained will, when viewed in their proper perspective,
                        be regarded as gains of incalculable value, affecting both its immediate fortunes
                        as well as its ultimate destiny.

                        the enthusiasm or daunting the spirit of the prosecutors of God’s Plan, served, by
                        deflecting their gaze from a storm-tossed continent, to focus their minds and resources
                        on ministering to the urgent needs of that Hemisphere in which the first honors and
                        the initial successes of the heroes of the Formative Age of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh
                        are to be scored and won. The sudden extinction of the earthly life of that star-servant

                        journey round the world—journeys that carried her to the humblest homes as well as
                        the palaces of royalty—was hurrying homeward to lend her promised aid to her fellow
                        countrymen in their divinely appointed task—such a death, though it frustrated this
                        cherished resolution of her indomitable spirit, steeled the hearts of her bereaved
                        lovers and admirers to carry on, more energetically than ever, the work which she
                        herself had initiated, as far back as the year 1919, in every important city in the
                        South American continent.<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#049567160">47</a></sup> The subtle and contemptible machinations by which the puny adversaries of the Faith,
                        jealous of its consolidating power and perturbed by the compelling evidences of its
                        conspicuous victories, have sought to challenge the validity and misrepresent the
                        character of the Administrative Order embedded in its teachings have galvanized the
                        swelling army of its defenders to arise and arraign the usurpers of their sacred rights
                        and to defend the long-standing strongholds of the institutions of their Faith in
                        their home country. And now as this year, so memorable in the annals of the Faith,
                        was drawing to a close, there befell the American Bahá’í community, through the dramatic
                        and sudden death of May Maxwell, yet another loss, which viewed in retrospect will
                        come to be regarded as a potent blessing conferred upon the campaign now being so
                        diligently conducted by its members. Laden with the fruits garnered through well-nigh
                        half a century of toilsome service to the Cause she so greatly loved, heedless of
                        the warnings of age and ill health, and afire with the longing to worthily demonstrate
                        her gratitude in her overwhelming awareness of the bounties of her Lord and Master,
                        she set her face towards the southern outpost of the Faith in the New World, and laid
                        down her life in such a spirit of consecration and self-sacrifice as has truly merited
                        the crown of martyrdom. To Keith Ransom-Kehler, whose dust sleeps in far-off Iṣfahán;
                        to Martha Root, fallen in her tracks on an island in the midmost heart of the ocean;
                        and to May Maxwell, lying in solitary glory in the southern outpost of the Western
                        Hemisphere—to these three heroines of the Formative Age of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh
                        they who now labor so assiduously for its expansion and establishment owe a debt of
                        gratitude which future generations will not fail to adequately recognize.

                        <a id="198679193" class="brl-location"></a>To these words, written on my behalf, and in answer to your particular questions relating
                        to the administrative issues that confront you in these days, I wish to add my own
                        tribute to the magnificent manner in which you face the problems, both spiritual and
                        administrative, which the expansion of the Faith is continually raising, and to the
                        way in which you resolve them, explain their nature, and derive fresh strength from
                        your experience of any one of them. The text of the annual reports demonstrates this
                        fact, and establishes for all time the high standard according to which the administrative
                        machinery of the Faith is functioning, developing and consolidating itself under your
                        able and energetic direction. As the administrative processes expand, as their operation
                        steadily improves, as their necessity is more fully and strikingly demonstrated, and
                        their beneficent influence correspondingly grows more apparent and evident, so will
                        the blessings, the strength, and guidance bestowed by Him Who animates and directs
                        these processes be more abundantly vouchsafed to those who have been called upon to
                        utilize them, in this age, for the execution of God’s Purpose and for the ultimate
                        redemption of a sore-stricken, travailing humanity. Many will be the setbacks, the
                        shocks and the disturbances, which the commotions of a convulsive age must produce;
                        yet no force, however violent and worldwide in its range and catastrophic in its immediate
                        consequences, can either halt these processes or deflect their appointed course. How
                        great, then, the privilege, and how staggering the responsibility, of those who are
                        destined to guard over them and to bring them eventually to full fruition. Nothing
                        short of utter, of continuous, consecration to His Will and Purpose can enable them
                        to fulfill their high destiny.

                        outposts, and despite such formidable difficulties, restrictions, obstacles and dangers,
                        so many evidences of the solidarity, the valor, and the achievements of the American
                        Bahá’í community. As the end of the First Century of the Bahá’í Era approaches, as
                        the shadows descending upon and enveloping mankind steadily and remorselessly deepen,
                        this community, which can almost be regarded as the solitary champion of the Faith
                        in the Western World, is increasingly evincing and demonstrating its capacity, its
                        worth, and ability as the torchbearer of the New, the World civilization which is
                        destined to supplant in the fullness of time the present one. And more particularly
                        in the virgin and far-flung territories of Latin America, it has, in recent months,
                        abundantly given visible evidence of its merits and competence to shoulder the immense
                        responsibilities which the carrying of the sacred fire to all the Republics of the
                        Western Hemisphere must necessarily entail.

                        this community has taken, through the settlement in each of these sovereign states
                        of the New World of American Bahá’í pioneers, through the formation of Bahá’í groups
                        and the establishment of two Assemblies in Buenos Aires and Bahia, the American National
                        Assembly, as well as its Inter-America Committee, and all subsidiary agencies, no
                        less than the individual members of the North American Bahá’í community who have sacrificed
                        and are still sacrificing so much in their support of this Divine and momentous Plan,
                        have earned the unqualified admiration and the undying gratitude of sister Assemblies
                        and fellow workers throughout the Bahá’í world.

                        <a id="186097872" class="brl-location"></a>Their work, however, is only beginning. The dispatch of pioneers, the provision of
                        adequate means for their support, their settlement and initiation of Bahá’í activities
                        in these far-off lands, however strenuous and meritorious, are insufficient if the
                        Plan is to evolve harmoniously and yield promptly its destined fruit. The extension
                        by the Parent Assembly—the immediate source from which this vast system with all its
                        ramifications is now proceeding—of the necessary support, guidance, recognition, and
                        material assistance to enable these newly fledged groups and Assemblies to function
                        in strict accordance with both the spiritual and administrative principles of the
                        Faith of Bahá’u’lláh would seem as essential and urgent as the preliminary task already
                        achieved. To nurse these tender plants of the Vineyard of God, to foster their growth,
                        to direct their development, to accord them the necessary recognition, to help resolve
                        their problems, to familiarize them, with gentleness, patience and fidelity, with
                        the processes of the Administrative Order and thus enable them to assume independently
                        the conduct of future local and national Bahá’í activities, would bring the Plan to
                        swift and full fruition and would add fresh laurels to the crown of immortal glory
                        already won by a community that holds, in these days of dark and dire calamities,
                        valiantly and almost alone, the Fort of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh. Fortified by these
                        reflections, let them gird up their loins for still mightier exertions and more brilliant
                        victories.

                        of all men, and the Deliverer of the nations. It is the rod of both the anger of God
                        and of His correction. The fierceness of its devastating power chastens the children
                        of men for their refusal to acclaim the century-old Message of their promised, their
                        Heaven-sent Redeemer. The fury of its flames, on the other hand, purges away the dross,
                        and welds the limbs of humanity into one single organism, indivisible, purified, God-conscious
                        and Divinely directed. Its immediate cause can be traced to the forces engendered
                        by the last war of which it may truly be regarded as the direct continuation.

                        <a id="365703187" class="brl-location"></a>Its first sparks were kindled on the eastern shores of the Asiatic continent, enveloping
                        two sister races of the world in a conflagration which no force seems able to either
                        quench or circumscribe. This cataclysmic process was accelerated by the outbreak of
                        a fierce conflict in the heart of Europe, fanning into flame age-long animosities
                        and unchaining a series of calamities as swift as they were appalling. As the turmoil
                        gathered momentum it swept remorselessly into its vortex the most powerful nations
                        of the European continent—the chief protagonists of that highly vaunted yet lamentably
                        defective civilization. The mounting tide of its havoc and devastation soon overspread
                        the northernmost regions of that afflicted continent, subsequently ravaged the shores
                        of the Mediterranean, and invaded the African continent as far as Ethiopia and the
                        surrounding territories. The Balkan countries, as predicted by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, were
                        soon to sustain the impact of this tragic ordeal, communicating in their turn the
                        commotions to which they had been subjected to both the Near and Middle East, wherein
                        are enshrined the Heart of the Faith itself, its Cradle, its chief Center of Pilgrimage,
                        and its most sacred and historic sites.

                        <a id="333192199" class="brl-location"></a>Its menace is overleaping the limits of the Old World and is plunging into consternation
                        the Great Republic of the West, as well as the peoples of Central and South America.
                        The New World, as well as the Old, is experiencing the terrific impact of this disruptive
                        force. Even the peoples of the Antipodes are trembling before the approaching tempest
                        that threatens to burst on their heads.

                        to its consuming violence. The world’s religious systems are no less affected by the
                        universal paralysis which is creeping over the minds and souls of men. The persecution
                        of world Jewry, the rapid deterioration of Christian institutions, the intestine divisions
                        and disorders of Islám, are but manifestations of the fear and trembling that has
                        seized humanity in its hour of unprecedented turmoil and peril. On the high seas,
                        in the air, on land, in the forefront of battle, in the palaces of kings and the cottages
                        of peasants, in the most hallowed sanctuaries, whether secular or religious, the evidences
                        of God’s retributive act and mysterious discipline are manifest. Its heavy toll is
                        steadily mounting—a holocaust sparing neither prince nor peasant, neither man nor
                        woman, neither young nor old.

                        of God and incarnating His Purpose for mankind in this age—can neither aspire nor
                        expect to escape unhurt amid the hurricane of human disasters that blows around it.
                        By most men unnoticed, scorned and ridiculed by some, feared and challenged by others,
                        this world-redemptive Faith, for whose precious sake the world is undergoing such
                        agony, finds its virgin strength assailed, and its infant institutions hemmed in by
                        the dark forces which a godless civilization has unloosed over the face of the planet.
                        In the Old World, whether in Europe, Asia or Africa, it is being buffeted about, ostracized,
                        arraigned and repressed. In certain countries its community life is being extinguished,
                        in others a ban is severely imposed on its propagation, in still others its members
                        are denied all intercourse with its World Center. Dangers, grave and unsuspected,
                        confront its Cradle and surround its very Heart.

                        summons, at this challenging hour, the peoples of the New World and its leaders to
                        redress the balance of the Old. “<span class="brl-italic">O Rulers of America,</span>” He thus addresses the Chief Magistrates of that continent, “<span class="brl-italic">and the Presidents of the Republics therein! … Adorn the temple of your dominion with
                           the ornament of Justice and of the fear of God, and its head with the crown of the
                           remembrance of your Lord, the Maker of the heavens.</span>” The Great Republic of the West, an object of special solicitude throughout the ministry
                        of the Center of the Covenant, whose soil has been hallowed by His footsteps, and
                        the foundation of whose Edifice—the Mother Temple of the West—has been consecrated
                        by His hand, has been singled out through the operation of His Will and been invested
                        by His pen with a unique, an inescapable, a weighty and most sacred responsibility.
                        The Mission entrusted to the community of the North American believers in the darkest
                        days of the last war is, after a period of incubation of well-nigh twenty years, and
                        through the instrumentality of the administrative agencies erected after ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s
                        passing, efflorescing under our very eyes. Already, since the inception of the Seven
                        Year Plan, this community can well claim to have attained, through its deeds, a stature
                        that dwarfs its sister communities, and can glory in a parentage that embraces every
                        Republic of Latin America. The first Ma<u>sh</u>riqu’l-A<u>dh</u>kár of the West, its beauteous and noble handiwork, is virtually completed. A nucleus
                        for a future flourishing local community is already formed in every state and province
                        in North America. The administrative structure, following the pattern of its prototype
                        in the U.S.A., is, through the agency of that same Plan, raising its triumphant head
                        in the Central and South American Republics. The Plan itself, propelled by the energies
                        released by those immortal Tablets which constitute its charter, bids fair, in the
                        fifth year of its operation, to exceed the highest expectations of those who have
                        so courageously launched it. Its consummation, coinciding with the termination of
                        the first century of the Bahá’í Era, will mark the opening of yet another phase in
                        a series of crusades which must carry, in the course of the succeeding century, the
                        privileged recipients of those epoch-making Tablets beyond the Western Hemisphere
                        to the uttermost ends of the earth, to implant the banner, and lay an unassailable
                        basis for the administrative structure of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh.

                        Obscure in his origin, ambitious of leadership, untaught by the lesson of such as
                        have erred before him, odious in the hopes he nurses, contemptible in the methods
                        he pursues, shameless in his deliberate distortions of truths he has long since ceased
                        to believe in, ludicrous in his present isolation and helplessness, wounded and exasperated
                        by the downfall which his own folly has precipitated, he, the latest protagonist of
                        a spurious cause, cannot but in the end be subjected, as remorselessly as his infamous
                        predecessors, to the fate which they invariably have suffered.

                        the cohesive strength of the institutions of that Faith, the incorruptibility of its

                        a portion of the globe, so turbulent in its history, so challenging in its claims,
                        so diversified in the elements it has assimilated into its administrative structure,
                        should at all times be immune to any divergence of opinion, or any defection on the
                        part of its multitudinous followers, would be sheer delusion, wholly unreasonable
                        and unwarranted, even in the face of the unprecedented evidences of the miraculous
                        power which its rise and progress have so powerfully exhibited. That such a secession,
                        however, whether effected by those who apostatize their faith or preach heretical
                        doctrines, should have failed, after the lapse of a century, to split in twain the
                        entire body of the adherents of the Faith, or to create a grave, a permanent and irremediable
                        breach in its organic structure, is a fact too eloquent for even a casual observer
                        of the internal processes of its Administrative Order to either deny or ignore.

                        <a id="751396327" class="brl-location"></a>Dear friends! Manifold, various, and at times extremely perilous, have been the tragic
                        crises which the blind hatred, the unbounded presumption, the incredible folly, the
                        abject perfidy, the vaulting ambition of the enemy have intermittently engendered
                        within the pale of the Faith. From some of its most powerful and renowned votaries,
                        at the hands of its once trusted and ablest propagators, champions, and administrators,
                        from the ranks of its most revered and highly placed trustees, whether as companions,
                        amanuenses, or appointed lieutenants of the Herald of the Faith, of its Author, and
                        of the Center of His Covenant, from even those who were numbered among the kindred
                        of the Manifestation, not excluding the brother, the sons and daughters of Bahá’u’lláh,
                        and the nominee of the Báb Himself, a Faith, of such tender age, and enshrining so
                        priceless a promise, has sustained blows as dire and treacherous as any recorded in
                        the world’s religious history.

                        crisis, is laden with the description of a new calamity, recounts the tale of a base
                        betrayal, and is stained with the account of unspeakable atrocities, there emerges,
                        clear and incontrovertible, the supreme truth that with every fresh outbreak of hostility
                        to the Faith, whether from within or from without, a corresponding measure of outpouring
                        grace, sustaining its defenders and confounding its adversaries, has been providentially
                        released, communicating a fresh impulse to the onward march of the Faith, while this
                        impetus, in its turn, would, through its manifestations, provoke fresh hostility in
                        quarters heretofore unaware of its challenging implications—this increased hostility
                        being accompanied by a still more arresting revelation of Divine Power and a more
                        abundant effusion of celestial grace, which, by enabling the upholders of that Faith
                        to register still more brilliant victories, would thereby generate issues of still
                        more vital import and raise up still more formidable enemies against a Cause that
                        cannot but in the end resolve those issues and crush the resistance of those enemies,
                        through a still more glorious unfoldment of its inherent power.

                        within itself both engender, resolves itself into a series of rhythmic pulsations,
                        precipitated, on the one hand, through the explosive outbursts of its foes, and the
                        vibrations of Divine Power, on the other, which speed it, with ever-increasing momentum,

                        we can utilize for the furtherance of His Faith and the routing and complete elimination

                        <a id="713235619" class="brl-location"></a>The entry of the United States of America into the war invests it with the character
                        of a truly world-embracing crisis, designed to release world-shaking, world-shaping
                        forces, which, as they operate, and mount in intensity, will throw down the barriers
                        that hinder the emergence of that world community which the world Religion of Bahá’u’lláh
                        has anticipated and can alone permanently establish. It marks a milestone on the road
                        which must lead the peoples of the North American continent to the glorious destiny
                        that awaits them. It confronts the American Bahá’í community, already so well advanced
                        in the prosecution of their Seven Year Plan, with a challenge at once severe and inescapable.
                        The exterior ornamentation of their consecrated Edifice has been providentially expedited
                        to a point where its completion is now assured. The intercontinental and national
                        teaching campaigns that constitute the second and even more vital aspect of that Plan,
                        though progressing magnificently in the States, in Canada and throughout Latin America,
                        are still far from having attained their consummation. The obstacles which the extension
                        of the war to the Western Hemisphere has raised are, I am well aware, manifold and
                        formidable. The heroic self-sacrifice exhibited by the North American Bahá’í community
                        will, I am confident, surmount them. The Hand of Omnipotence, which has led so mighty
                        a member of the human race to plunge into the turmoil of world disaster, that has
                        provided thereby the means for the effective and decisive participation of so promising
                        a nation in the immediate trials and the future reconstruction of human society, will
                        not and cannot allow those who are directly, consciously and worthily promoting the
                        highest interests of their nation and of the world to fall short of the accomplishment
                        of their God-given task. He will, more than ever before in their history, pour out
                        His blessings upon them, if they refuse to allow the present circumstances, grievous
                        though they are, to interfere with the full and uninterrupted execution of this initial
                        undertaking in pursuance of their world Mission. The coming two years must witness,
                        fraught as they may well be with the greatest ordeal afflicting their countrymen,
                        a manifestation of spiritual vitality and an output of heroic action, commensurate
                        with the gravity and afflictions of the present hour, and worthy of the concluding
                        years of the first Bahá’í century.

                        <a id="257510249" class="brl-location"></a>Viewed in the perspective of Bahá’í history, the Seven Year Plan, associated with
                        the closing years of the First Bahá’í Century, will come to be regarded as the mightiest
                        instrument yet forged, designed to enable the trustees of a firmly established, steadily
                        evolving Administrative Order to complete the initial stage in the prosecution of
                        the world mission confidently entrusted by the Center of the Covenant to His chosen
                        disciples. The Divine Plan, thus set in operation, may be said to have derived its
                        inspiration from, and been dimly foreshadowed in, the injunction so significantly
                        addressed by Bahá’u’lláh to the Chief Magistrates of the American continent. It was
                        prompted by the contact established by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá Himself, in the course of His
                        historic journey, with the entire body of His followers throughout the United States
                        and Canada. It was conceived, soon after that contact was established, in the midst
                        of what was then held to be one of the most devastating crises in human history. It
                        underwent a period of incubation, after His ascension, while the machinery of a divinely
                        appointed Administrative Order was being laboriously devised and its processes set
                        in motion. Its initial operations were providentially made to synchronize with the
                        final years of a century that witnessed the birth and rise of a Faith of which it
                        is the direct consequence. The opening stage in its execution has been faced by, and
                        will survive, the severe challenge of a crisis of still greater magnitude than that
                        which baptized its birth. The conclusion of the first phase of its tremendous and
                        irresistible unfoldment is now approaching. The hopes and aspirations of a multitude
                        of believers, in both the East and the West, young and old, whether free or suppressed,
                        hang on its triumphant consummation. The Temple itself, that fair incarnation of the
                        soul of an unconquerable Faith, and the first fruit of the Plan now set in motion,
                        stands, in its silent beauty, ready to reinforce the strenuous endeavors of its prosecutors.
                        Towering in grandeur and resplendent in its majesty it calls aloud incessantly for
                        a greater, a far greater, number of pioneers who, both at home and in foreign fields,
                        will scatter to sow the Divine seeds and gather the harvest into its gates. The Author
                        of the Plan Himself, looking down from His retreats above, and surveying the prodigious
                        labors of His defeatless disciples, voices, with even greater insistence, the same
                        call. The time in which to respond to it is relentlessly shortening. Let men of action
                        seize their chance ere the swiftly passing days place it irretrievably beyond their
                        reach.

                        of the Seven Year Plan, the vastness of the field already covered by the pioneer activities
                        of its stalwart and valiant prosecutors. The heights of heroic self-sacrifice to which
                        they have attained, the depths of faith and devotion they have plumbed in the course
                        of their ceaseless exertions are no less noteworthy than the immensity of the task
                        they have already performed. An effort so prodigious, a mission so sublime, a solidarity
                        so truly remarkable, an achievement which in its scope and quality stands unparalleled
                        in American Bahá’í history, provide a befitting climax to the century-old record of
                        magnificent accomplishments associated with the rise and progress of the Faith of
                        Bahá’u’lláh. Such a glorious century, so unique in the annals of mankind’s spiritual
                        history, is, however, not yet completed. The gigantic enterprises which the American
                        believers are pledged to consummate are as yet but partially concluded. The remaining
                        two years must witness an intensification of Bahá’í activity, throughout the entire
                        Western Hemisphere, on such a scale as to eclipse the splendor of all past achievements,
                        and worthily crown this initial phase in the progressive evolution of the Divine Plan.
                        An unprecedented multiplication in the number of pioneer teachers and settlers; an
                        unexampled flow of material resources for their maintenance and the extension of their
                        labors; a still wider dissemination of Bahá’í literature, to aid and support them
                        in their presentation of the Faith to Latin American peoples; an immediate increase
                        in the number of groups and Assemblies in the states and provinces of North America;
                        an increased awareness on the part of all believers, whether in the North or in the
                        South, whether newly enrolled or of old standing in the Faith, that every one of them
                        shares, vitally and directly and without any exception, in the responsibility for
                        the successful prosecution of the Plan; a still firmer resolution not to allow a world-convulsing
                        conflict, with its attendant miseries, perils, dislocations, and anxieties, to deflect
                        them from their course or distract their attention—these are the crying needs of this
                        critical, this challenging, this swiftly passing hour. To exploit its possibilities,
                        to meet its challenge, to grasp its implications, is the manifest, the inescapable
                        and urgent duty of every member of the Bahá’í communities now laboring so assiduously
                        in the Western Hemisphere. May the cumulative effect of their concentrated and sustained
                        labors shed further luster on the concluding years of this, the first century of the
                        Bahá’í Era.

                        <a id="846703510" class="brl-location"></a>The recent response of the American friends to my appeal for pioneers to go forth
                        and settle in virgin territories and places where the need is greatest has raised
                        a load from my heart, and mightily reinforced the hopes and expectations which their
                        past achievements have aroused within me. We stand at the threshold of the last year
                        of the first Bahá’í century. The unfinished tasks, however much they have been reduced,
                        are still formidable. The Temple is as yet unfinished. The initiation of a nationwide
                        publicity campaign, intelligently directed and energetically pursued, utilizing to
                        the full the advantages gained in recent years in so many fields of Bahá’í activity
                        still remains to be undertaken. Measures for a befitting celebration of the centennial
                        anniversary of the Faith must be carefully considered and duly executed. The aims
                        and purposes of our beloved Cause, the achievements of its heroes, martyrs, teachers,
                        pioneers, and administrators, the unity of its followers, the character of the institutions
                        they have reared, should, one and all, be ably presented, widely broadcast, carefully
                        explained in publications, through the radio and the press. There is no time to lose.
                        A great responsibility rests on the elected representatives of the most envied community
                        in the Bahá’í world, whose advantages are unique, whose capacities are incomparable,
                        whose vision, courage, tenacity, resolution and loyalty are exemplary, and which has
                        amply demonstrated its worthiness to be the recipient of the countless favors showered
                        upon it by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, and of the specific bounty conferred upon the rulers and
                        presidents of the continent of which it is a part by no one less than Bahá’u’lláh
                        Himself, in His Most Holy Book. To His “Apostles,” as testified by the Center of His
                        Covenant, I direct my fervent plea that they establish, beyond the shadow of a doubt
                        in these concluding months of the first Bahá’í century, their indisputable right to
                        be designated by so exalted a title, and vindicate their ability to execute the mission
                        with which that title has invested them.

                        and the crowning glory of the first Bahá’í century, is an event of unique and transcendental
                        significance. Neither the first Mashriqu’l-A<u>dh</u>kár of the Bahá’í world, reared in the City of ‘I<u>sh</u>qábád, nor any House of Worship to be raised in succeeding centuries, can claim to
                        possess the vast, the immeasurable potentialities with which this Mother Temple of
                        the West, established in the very heart of so enviable a continent, and whose foundation
                        stone has been laid by the hand of the Center of the Covenant Himself, has been endowed.
                        Conceived forty years ago by that little band of far-sighted and resolute disciples
                        of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, members of the first Bahá’í community established in the Western
                        Hemisphere; blessed and fostered by a vigilant Master Who directed its course from
                        the hour of its inception to the last days of His life; supported by the spontaneous
                        contributions of Bahá’ís poured in from the five continents of the globe; this noble,
                        this mighty, this magnificent enterprise deserves to rank among the immortal epics
                        that have adorned the annals of the Apostolic Age of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh.
                     </p>

                        <a id="628497950" class="brl-location"></a>The debt of gratitude owed by the entire Bahá’í world to its champion builders is
                        indeed immeasurable. The admiration which this brilliant exploit has evoked in the
                        breasts of countless followers of the Faith in East and West knows no bounds. The
                        creative energies its completion must unleash are incalculable. The role it is destined
                        to play in hastening the emergence of the World Order of Bahá’u’lláh, now stirring
                        in the womb of this travailing age, cannot as yet be fathomed. We stand too close
                        to so majestic, so lofty, so radiant, so symbolic a monument raised so heroically
                        to the glory of the Most Great Name, at so critical a stage in human history, and
                        at so significant a spot in a continent so richly endowed, to be able to visualize
                        the future glories which the consummation of this institution, this Harbinger of an
                        as yet unborn civilization, must in the fullness of time disclose to the eyes of all
                        mankind.

                        <a id="326080441" class="brl-location"></a>That so laborious, so meritorious, an undertaking has been completed a year before
                        its appointed time is a further cause for rejoicing and gratitude and an added testimony
                        to the vision, the resourcefulness, and enterprising spirit of the American believers.

                        though they have been, nor is this the time to expatiate on the superb spirit that
                        has characterized their stewardship in the service of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh. Tasks,
                        of extreme urgency, of great magnitude, of the utmost significance, await them in
                        this concluding year of the first Bahá’í century, and at this hour of great peril,
                        of stress and trial for all mankind. The sacred, the pressing, the inescapable teaching
                        responsibilities, assumed under the Seven Year Plan, must be resolutely faced as befits
                        those whose record has shed so brilliant a light on the annals of the first Bahá’í
                        century. The consolidation of each and every nucleus, formed so painstakingly in every
                        Republic of Central and South America, the formation of a Bahá’í Assembly in every
                        virgin state and province in the North American continent, call for undivided attention,
                        for further heroism, for a concerted, a persistent, and herculean effort on the part
                        of the stalwart builders of that beauteous Edifice which posterity will recognize
                        as the greatest shrine in the Western world.

                        <a id="201478413" class="brl-location"></a>Nor must the elaborate preparations in connection with the forthcoming celebration
                        of the centenary of our glorious Faith be overlooked or neglected, if we would befittingly
                        consummate this first, this most fecund, century of the Bahá’í Era. An unprecedented,
                        a carefully conceived, efficiently coordinated, nationwide campaign, aiming at the
                        proclamation of the message of Bahá’u’lláh, through speeches, articles in the press,
                        and radio broadcasts, should be promptly initiated and vigorously prosecuted. The
                        universality of the Faith, its aims and purposes, episodes in its dramatic history,
                        testimonials to its transforming power, and the character and distinguishing features
                        of its World Order should be emphasized and explained to the general public, and particularly
                        to eminent friends and leaders sympathetic to its cause, who should be approached
                        and invited to participate in the celebrations. Lectures, conferences, banquets, special
                        publications should, to whatever extent is practicable and according to the resources
                        at the disposal of the believers, proclaim the character of this joyous Festival.
                        An All-America Convention, at which representatives of Bahá’í centers in every republic
                        in Central and South America will be invited to participate and, to which, for the
                        first time, all isolated believers, all groups, and all communities already possessing
                        Local Spiritual Assemblies, will have the right to appoint delegates and to share
                        in the election of the National Spiritual Assembly, will moreover have to be held
                        to commemorate this epoch-making event. A dedication ceremony, in consonance with
                        the solemnity of the occasion, and held beneath the dome of the Mashriqu’l-A<u>dh</u>kár on the very day and at the very hour of the Báb’s historic Declaration, followed
                        by a public session, consecrated to the memory of both the Báb and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, should
                        constitute the leading features of this historic Convention.

                        <a id="360443526" class="brl-location"></a>For it should be borne in mind that in the year 1944 we celebrate not only the termination
                        of the first century of the Bahá’í Era, but also the centenary of the birth of the
                        Bábí Dispensation, of the inception of the Bahá’í cycle, and of the birth of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
                        and commemorate as well the fiftieth anniversary of the establishment of the Bahá’í
                        Faith in the western world.<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#863689530">63</a></sup>

                        success of the celebrations which this historic year, of such manifold significance,
                        must witness. He Who in the past has, in divers ways and on so many occasions, graciously
                        and unfailingly guided, blessed, and sustained the members of this privileged community
                        will, no doubt, continue to aid and inspire them to carry to a victorious conclusion
                        the unfinished tasks which still confront them, and will enable them to crown their
                        labors in a manner that will befit their high destiny.

                        the members of the American Bahá’í community have been such as to excite the brightest
                        hopes for the victorious consummation of the collective undertaking they have so courageously
                        launched and have so vigorously prosecuted in recent years. As the first Bahá’í Century
                        approaches its end, the magnitude and quality of their achievements acquire added
                        significance and shed increasing luster on its annals. The proceedings of the recently
                        held annual Convention; the formation of twenty-eight Assemblies in the course of
                        the year that has just elapsed; the splendid progress achieved in the inter-American
                        field of Bahá’í activity; the superb spirit evinced by the pioneers holding their
                        lonely posts in widely scattered areas throughout the Americas; the exemplary attitude
                        shown by the entire body of the faithful towards the machinations of those who have
                        so sedulously striven to disrupt the Faith and pervert its purpose—these have, to
                        a marked degree, intensified the admiration of the Bahá’í communities for those who
                        are contributing so outstanding a share to the enlargement of the limits, and the
                        enhancement of the prestige of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh. The preparations which the
                        American believers are undertaking for the celebration of the Centenary of the Faith
                        must be such as to crown with immortal glory the fifty-year-long record of their stewardship
                        in the service of that Faith. Such a celebration must, in its scope and magnificence,
                        fully compensate for the disabilities which hinder so many Bahá’í communities in Europe
                        and elsewhere, and even in Bahá’u’lláh’s native land, from paying a befitting tribute
                        to their beloved Faith at so glorious an hour in its history. The few remaining months
                        of this century must witness a concentration of effort, a scale of achievement, a
                        spirit of heroism that will outshine even the most daring exploits that have already
                        immortalized the Seven Year Plan and covered with glory its valiant prosecutors. The
                        plea I address to them, at this late hour, will, I am sure, meet with a response no
                        less remarkable than their past reactions to the appeals I have felt impelled to make
                        to them ever since the inception of the Plan. He Who at every stage of their collective
                        enterprise has so abundantly blessed them will, no doubt, continue to vouchsafe His
                        blessings until the seal of unqualified victory is set upon their epoch-making task.

                        <a id="409443812" class="brl-location"></a>The vigorous action promptly taken by your Assembly to ensure the success of the forthcoming
                        Centenary celebrations is highly commendable, and provides a fresh demonstration of
                        the magnificent response made by the American believers to every call demanding renewed
                        exertion on their part in the service of the Cause of Bahá’u’lláh. The progress recently
                        achieved in building up Spiritual Assemblies in the virgin areas of the North American
                        continent has been truly remarkable. To consummate so vast an enterprise, however,
                        a still more compelling display of the vitality of the spirit animating the American
                        Bahá’í community is required, a still greater concentration of effort is needed, an
                        even more stirring evidence of the daring boldness of its members is imperative. Whoever
                        will arise, in these concluding, fast-fleeting months of the last year of the first
                        Bahá’í Century, to fill the remaining posts, and thereby set the seal of total victory
                        on a Plan so pregnant with promise, will earn the lasting gratitude of the present
                        generation of believers in both the East and the West, will merit the acclaim of posterity,
                        will be vouchsafed the special benediction of the Concourse on High, and be made the
                        recipient of the imperishable bounties of Him Who is the Divine Author of the Plan
                        itself. Whoever will rush forth, at this eleventh hour, and cast his weight into the
                        scales, and contribute his decisive share to so gigantic, so sacred and historic an
                        undertaking, will have not only helped to seal the triumph of the Plan itself but
                        will also have notably participated in the fulfillment of what may be regarded as
                        the crowning act of an entire century. The opportunity that presents itself at this
                        crucial hour is precious beyond expression. The blessings destined to flow from a
                        victory so near at hand are rich beyond example. One final surge of that indomitable
                        spirit that has carried the American Bahá’í community to such heights is all that
                        is required, as the first Bahá’í Century speeds to a close, to release the flow of
                        those blessings that must signalize the termination of the first, and usher in the
                        dawn of the second, Bahá’í Century.

                        Bahá’í Community has at long last been brilliantly accomplished. The structural basis
                        of the Administrative Order of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh has, through this superb victory,
                        and on the very eve of the worldwide celebrations of the Centenary of His Faith, been
                        firmly laid by the champion-builders of His World Order in every state of the Great
                        Republic of the West and in every province of the Dominion of Canada. In each of the
                        republics of Central and South America, moreover, the banner of His undefeatable Faith
                        has been implanted by the members of that same community, while in no less than thirteen
                        republics of Latin America, as well as in two dependencies in the West Indies, Spiritual
                        Assemblies have been established and are already functioning—a feat that has outstripped
                        the goal originally fixed for the valiant members of that community in their intercontinental
                        sphere of Bahá’í activity. The exterior ornamentation of the first Ma<u>sh</u>riqu’l-A<u>dh</u>kár of the West—the culmination of a forty-year-old enterprise repeatedly blessed
                        and continually nurtured by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá—has, furthermore, through a remarkable manifestation
                        of the spirit of Bahá’í solidarity and self-sacrifice so powerfully animating the
                        members of that stalwart community, been successfully completed, more than a year
                        in advance of the time set for its termination.

                        and indeed ever undertaken by any Bahá’í community in the course of an entire century,
                        has been gloriously consummated. A victory of undying fame has marked the culmination
                        of the fifty-year-long labors of the American Bahá’í Community in the service of Bahá’u’lláh
                        and has shed imperishable luster on the immortal records of His Faith during the first
                        hundred years of its existence. The exploits that have marked the progress of this
                        prodigious, this threefold enterprise, covering a field stretching from Alaska in
                        the North to the extremity of Chile in the South, affecting the destinies of so great
                        a variety of peoples and nations, involving such a tremendous expenditure of treasure
                        and effort, calling forth so remarkable a spirit of heroism and self-sacrifice, and
                        undertaken notwithstanding the vicious assaults and incessant machinations of the
                        breakers of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Covenant, and despite the perils, the trials and restrictions
                        of a desolating war of unexampled severity, augur well for the successful prosecution,
                        and indeed assure the ultimate victory, of the remaining stages of the Plan conceived
                        a quarter of a century ago by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá for the followers of Bahá’u’lláh in the
                        North American continent.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="876366727" class="brl-location"></a>To the band of pioneers, whether settlers or itinerant teachers, who have forsaken
                        their homes, who have scattered far and wide, who have willingly sacrificed their
                        comfort, their health and even their lives for the prosecution of this Plan; to the
                        several committees and their auxiliary agencies that have been entrusted with special
                        and direct responsibility for its efficient and orderly development and who have discharged
                        their high responsibilities with exemplary vigor, courage and fidelity; to the national
                        representatives of the community itself, who have vigilantly and tirelessly supervised,
                        directed and coordinated the unfolding processes of this vast undertaking ever since
                        its inception; to all those who, though not in the forefront of battle, have, through
                        their financial assistance and through the instrumentality of their deputies, contributed
                        to the expansion and consolidation of the Plan, I myself, as well as the entire Bahá’í
                        world, owe a debt of gratitude that no one can measure or describe. To the sacrifices
                        they have made, to the courage they have so consistently shown, to the fidelity they
                        have so remarkably displayed, to the resourcefulness, the discipline, the constancy
                        and devotion they have so abundantly demonstrated future generations, viewing the
                        magnitude of their labors in their proper perspective, will no doubt pay adequate
                        tribute—a tribute no less ardent and well-deserved than the recognition extended by
                        the present-day builders of the World Order of Bahá’u’lláh to the Dawn-Breakers, whose
                        shining deeds have signalized the birth of the Heroic Age of His Faith.

                        <a id="686362208" class="brl-location"></a>To the elected representatives of all the Bahá’í communities of the New World, assembled
                        beneath the Dome of the Mother Temple of the West, on the occasion of the historic,
                        first All-America Bahá’í Convention—a convention at which every state and province
                        in the North American continent is represented, in which the representatives of every
                        republic of Latin America have been invited to participate, whose delegates have been
                        elected, for the first time in American Bahá’í history, by all local communities already
                        possessing Assemblies, by all groups and isolated believers throughout the United
                        States and Canada, and whose proceedings will be for ever associated with the celebration
                        of the Centenary of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh, of the hundredth anniversary of the
                        birth of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, of the fiftieth anniversary of the founding of the Bahá’í Faith
                        in the Western Hemisphere, and of the completion of the exterior ornamentation of
                        the First Mashriqu’l-A<u>dh</u>kár of the West—to all the privileged attendants of such an epoch-making Convention,
                        I, on my own behalf, as well as in the name of all Bahá’í communities sharing with
                        them, at this great turning-point in the history of our Faith, the joys and triumphs
                        of this solemn hour, feel moved to convey the expression of our loving admiration,
                        our joy and our gratitude for the brilliant conclusion of what posterity will no doubt
                        acclaim as one of the most stirring episodes in the history of the Formative Age of
                        the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh, as well as one of the most momentous enterprises undertaken
                        during the entire course of the first century of the Bahá’í Era.

                        <a id="463327637" class="brl-location"></a>The splendid and unique success that has attended the centenary celebrations so admirably
                        conducted by the American Bahá’í community has befittingly crowned not only the fifty-year
                        record of services rendered by its valiant members, but the labors associated with
                        the entire body of their fellow workers in East and West in the course of an entire
                        century. The consummation of the Seven Year Plan, immortalizing the fame of this richly
                        blessed community, set the seal of complete spiritual triumph on these historic celebrations.
                        A memorable chapter in the history of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh in the West has been
                        closed. A new chapter is now opening, a chapter which, ere its termination, must eclipse
                        the most shining victories won so heroically by those who have so fearlessly launched
                        the first stage of the Great Plan conceived by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá for the American believers.
                        The prizes won so painstakingly in both the North and South American continents must
                        be preserved at all costs. A mighty impetus should, at however great a sacrifice,
                        be lent to the multiplication of Bahá’í centers in Latin America, to the expansion
                        of Bahá’í literature, to the translation of the Bahá’í sacred writings, to the proclamation
                        of the verities of the Faith to the masses, to the strengthening of the bonds binding
                        the newly fledged communities to each other, and to the deepening of the spiritual
                        life of their members.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="245469882" class="brl-location"></a>The task so marvelously initiated in the Latin republics must be further consolidated
                        ere the prosecutors of the world Plan bequeathed by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá can embark on further
                        stages, of still greater significance, in their world teaching Mission. The cessation
                        of hostilities will open before them fields of service of tremendous fertility and
                        undreamed of magnitude. The advantages and opportunities these fields will offer them
                        cannot be exploited unless and until the work to which they have already set their
                        hands in the Western Hemisphere is sufficiently advanced and consolidated. Time is
                        pressing. The new tasks are already beginning to loom on the horizon. The work that
                        still remains to be accomplished ere the next stage is ushered in is still considerable
                        and exacting. I feel confident that the American Bahá’í community will, as it has
                        in the past, rise to the occasion and discharge its high duties as befits the unique
                        position it occupies.

                        <a id="563783964" class="brl-location"></a>1944, a year memorable for the sharp contrast between the rising tide of spiritual
                        victories culminating in the Centenary celebrations of a world-embracing Faith and
                        the swiftly ebbing fortunes of a war-ravaged, disillusioned and bankrupt society,
                        is drawing to a close. In every continent of the globe; in the Holy Land, the Heart
                        and Center of our Faith and Pivot of its institutions; in the land of its birth; in
                        the adjoining territory of ‘Iráq; throughout the Western Hemisphere; in the British
                        Isles, so severely subjected to the violence of a world tempest; throughout the length
                        and breadth of India; in far-off Australasia and in the Nile Valley—all with the sole
                        exception of the distant republics of the West subjected in varying degrees to the
                        imminent danger of becoming the theater of war—the communities laboring for the promotion
                        of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh have, throughout five tumultuous years, been providentially
                        spared to hold aloft its banner, to preserve its integrity, to maintain the continuity
                        of its institutions, to enrich its annals, to consolidate its structure, to further
                        disseminate its literature and to befittingly celebrate its Centenary. Preponderant
                        indeed has been the share of that privileged community, which has been invested by
                        the Pen of the Center of the Covenant with a worldwide Mission, in the prosecution
                        of a task which, ever since the onset of this world upheaval and despite its mounting
                        horrors, the builders of the Administrative Order of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh have
                        so unflaggingly pursued. Neither the participation of the Great Republic of the West
                        in this fierce contest, nor the sorrows, burdens and restrictions which such direct
                        association with the agonies of a travailing age has entailed have thus far been capable
                        of dimming the splendor of the exploits that have immortalized the record of the services
                        of this community since the ascension of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. Indeed, coincident with the
                        period of America’s direct participation in this world struggle and in direct proportion
                        to the turmoil and the tribulations which such a participation has engendered, the
                        members of this community have evinced a heroism and proved themselves capable of
                        a concerted effort that have eclipsed the notable achievements that have heralded
                        the establishment of the Administrative Order of the Faith as well as the first stage
                        in the development of the Seven Year Plan.

                        <a id="623916877" class="brl-location"></a>What the year 1945, on whose threshold we now stand, has in store for the members
                        of this determined, this valiant, this watchful, this exemplary community only the
                        future can reveal. That the trials and afflictions suffered by their country and its
                        people must wax as this world upheaval moves towards a climax no one can any longer
                        doubt. The challenge that will face this stalwart community will no doubt be severe.
                        To allow the prizes so nobly won, over so vast a field, at so great a cost, at so
                        critical an hour, to fall into jeopardy would be unworthy of a career so auspiciously
                        initiated, so completely dedicated to the Cause of God, so rich in promise and so
                        brilliant in almost every phase of its evolution. Every Local Assembly, the ordained
                        pivot of a divinely ordained System, which has been established in the states and
                        provinces of the North American continent, as well as in the republics of Latin America,
                        must, through a supreme effort on the part of pioneers, visiting teachers and Regional
                        Committees, be steadfastly maintained. Simultaneously a no less determined effort
                        should be exerted to enable the admittedly large number of groups scattered throughout
                        the Americas to attain Assembly status. No less urgent is the obligation to proclaim
                        the verities enshrined in the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh by every means which individuals,
                        Assemblies and committees can devise, through the press and radio, through an unprecedented
                        dissemination of literature, through its systematic translation into Spanish and Portuguese
                        and above all through active association with leaders of public thought as well as
                        direct contact with the masses of the people. Through such means as these, and through
                        such means only, can the members of the American Bahá’í community, who have so audaciously
                        and successfully launched the first stage of the Divine Plan, be enabled to pave the
                        way and usher in, soon after the cessation of hostilities, the succeeding stage in
                        the evolution of their world Mission. My prayers and loving thoughts surround them
                        continually in their devoted labors.

                        midst of one of the darkest periods in human history, and with which the destinies
                        of the followers of Bahá’u’lláh in the North American continent must for generations
                        to come remain inextricably interwoven, has, during the concluding years of the first
                        Bahá’í century, triumphantly emerged from the first stage of its evolution. Its initiation,
                        officially and on a vast scale, had, for well-nigh twenty years, been held in abeyance,
                        while the processes of a slowly emerging Administrative Order were, under the unerring
                        guidance of Providence, creating and perfecting the agencies for its efficient and
                        systematic prosecution. The next stage in the evolution of the Plan cannot, however,
                        be embarked upon, until the external causes, hampering its further unfoldment in other
                        continents of the globe, are removed through the cessation of hostilities, and the
                        signal victories already won through its initial development are sufficiently consolidated
                        throughout the Western Hemisphere.

                     <p>
                        <a id="826492178" class="brl-location"></a>The tasks confronting those who have so valiantly and brilliantly inaugurated the
                        first stage in the execution of the Great Design unfolded by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá for the
                        promulgation of the Faith of His Father, during this transitional period, are manifold,
                        exacting, urgent and sacred. The local administrative units, so laboriously constituted
                        throughout the Americas, must needs, as already pointed out and repeatedly stressed,
                        be maintained, reinforced, closely integrated and their number steadily multiplied.
                        The spirit that has inflamed the pioneers who have set the seal of triumph on the
                        Seven Year Plan, must, under the vigilant care of the national representatives of
                        the American Bahá’í community, be constantly watched, kept alive and nourished. The
                        literature of the Faith, particularly in Spanish and Portuguese, must be widely disseminated
                        in both Central and South America, as a necessary adjunct to the systematic consolidation
                        of the work that has been undertaken. Above all, the healing Message of Bahá’u’lláh
                        must, during the opening years of the second Bahá’í century, and through the instrumentality
                        of an already properly functioning Administrative Order, whose ramifications have
                        been extended to the four corners of the Western Hemisphere, be vividly, systematically
                        brought to the attention of the masses, in their hour of grief, misery and confusion.
                        A more audacious assertion of the challenging verities of the Faith; a more convincing
                        presentation of its distinguishing truths; a fuller exposition of the character, the
                        aims, and the achievements of its rising Administrative system, as the nucleus and
                        pattern of its future world-embracing order; a more direct and intimate contact and
                        association with the leaders of public thought whose activities and aims are akin
                        to the teachings of Bahá’u’lláh, for the purpose of demonstrating the universality,
                        the comprehensiveness, the liberality and the dynamic power of His Divine Message;
                        a closer scrutiny of the ways and means whereby its claims can be vindicated, its
                        defamers and detractors silenced, and its institutions safeguarded; a more determined
                        effort to exploit, to the fullest extent possible, the talents and abilities of the
                        rank and file of the believers for the purpose of achieving these ends—these stand
                        out as the paramount tasks summoning to a challenge, during these years of transition
                        and turmoil, the entire body of the American believers. The facilities which the Radio
                        and Press furnish must be utilized to a degree unprecedented in American Bahá’í history.
                        The combined resources of the much-envied, exemplary American Bahá’í community must
                        be harnessed for the effectual promotion of these meritorious purposes. Blessings,
                        undreamt of in their scope and plenteousness, are bound to be vouchsafed to those
                        who will, in these dark yet pregnant times, arise, to further these noble ends, and
                        to hasten through their acts the hour at which a still more momentous stage in the
                        evolution of a Divine and worldwide Plan can be launched.

                        <a id="380203951" class="brl-location"></a>There is no time to lose. The hour is ripe for the proclamation, without fear, without

                        sinking, and from which they who claim to be the followers of the Most Great Name
                        can and will eventually rescue it. The sooner they who labor for the recognition and
                        triumph of His Faith in the New World arise to carry out these inescapable duties,
                        the sooner will the hopes, the aims and objectives of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá as enshrined in
                        His own Plan, be translated from the realm of vision to the plane of actuality and
                        manifest the full force of the potentialities with which they have been endowed.

                        being set in motion, and which coincided with one of the darkest and most tragic periods

                        a new challenge summons the prosecutors of a Divine Plan to gird up their loins, muster
                        their resources, and prepare themselves for the launching of the second stage of an
                        enterprise which, as it reveals its full potentialities, must stretch to embrace the
                        five continents of the globe. World turmoil, grave dangers, severe restrictions, the
                        lethargy of the public engrossed in its war problems, have failed to dampen the zeal,
                        or to undermine the resolve, or to interfere with the successful discharge of the
                        duty assumed by those who have so determinedly embarked on the opening stage of their
                        world-encircling, divinely appointed mission. With the return to more normal conditions,

                        the masses as well as the leaders of public thought, at a further consolidation and
                        multiplication of the administrative centers scattered throughout the New World, and
                        constituting the nuclei of its future World Order and above all at a more convincing
                        revelation of Bahá’í love, unity, solidarity and self-sacrifice, which alone can hasten
                        the consummation of the preliminary undertakings required to terminate the period
                        of transition intervening between the first and second stages of the greatest crusade

                        is vast and urgent, the need of the suffering masses the world over, and particularly

                        assured. Its potency has been already fully experienced and abundantly demonstrated
                        in the years that have witnessed the most prodigious efforts exerted by the American
                        believers. A still more powerful display of its miraculous force can be confidently
                        anticipated, if those who have felt its impact in the past arise to carry out, in
                        the years that lie immediately ahead, the sublime and twofold task of the redemption
                        of mankind and the establishment of the world sovereignty of Bahá’u’lláh.

                        and Burma, are of such a distressing nature as to merit the energetic, the immediate,
                        and collective intervention of their fellow workers in lands which have providentially
                        been spared the horrors of invasion and all the evils and miseries attendant upon

                        and bloody conflict has, of all its sister communities in East and West, enjoyed the
                        greatest immunity and been privileged not only to maintain and preserve its institutions,
                        but to prosecute so successfully a Plan of such magnitude and significance, a special
                        responsibility now rests—a responsibility which, despite its manifold and pressing
                        duties in the Western Hemisphere, it can afford neither to neglect nor ignore.

                        and destitution are mysteriously paving the way for the revival of a Faith which the
                        Beloved Himself has unequivocally prophesied, where a once flourishing community is
                        struggling to fulfill the high hopes entertained for it by Him, and where the prosecutors
                        of the Divine Plan are to lend their direct and systematic assistance when launching
                        the second stage of their world mission, must the American believers contribute the
                        major share in the work of rehabilitation which the followers of Bahá’u’lláh must
                        arise to perform.

                        or otherwise, which they can undertake for the protection, reinstatement, and revival
                        of a greatly tested, highly promising and much loved community, the American believers
                        have the golden opportunity of adding a fresh chapter to the brilliant record of their
                        past international services to the Cause of God.

                        had furnished so shining an example of Bahá’í fellowship and solidarity, be underestimated.
                        The spirit which its remnant has displayed after so many years of persecution, dispersion
                        and danger, merits the widest measure of encouragement and support, both moral and
                        financial. Pressed as the American Bahá’í community must be by the twofold obligation
                        of proclaiming the verities of their Faith to the American public and of consolidating
                        the vast enterprises initiated throughout Latin America, the stalwart and privileged
                        followers of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh in North America cannot allow so great an opportunity
                        to advance the vital international interests of His Cause to slip from their grasp.
                        I feel confident that in the discharge of this additional task they will exhibit those
                        same traits that have distinguished their stewardship for so many years to so glorious
                        a Cause.

                        of their worldwide mission, be relentlessly prosecuted. That further responsibilities,
                        of a momentous character, will have to be superimposed on the stalwart prosecutors

                        their historic labors in obedience to His Wishes, no one can for a moment doubt. As
                        the field of their activities, ranging over entire continents, grows in scope and
                        in importance, the aims and purposes associated with the first stage of their glorious
                        mission must, in no wise, be either neglected or forgotten. The steady multiplication
                        of groups and of Spiritual Assemblies throughout the states of the Great American

                        throughout Latin America on an unassailable basis, and the dissemination of Bahá’í
                        literature among its people, demand, whatever the nature of the supplementary responsibilities
                        that will have to be assumed in the years to come, the closest attention on the part
                        of the entire body of the American believers, and must continue to be regarded as
                        the fundamental issues facing their national representatives. The exploits immortalizing
                        the first stage of the Divine Plan, however glorious their record, have yet to yield
                        their noblest fruits. Efforts, unremitting, systematic, and continent-wide in their
                        scope, can alone garner a harvest worthy of the high confidence placed in them by
                        ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. May they prove themselves increasingly worthy of so high a privilege,
                        so glorious a task.

                        <a id="871957629" class="brl-location"></a>To this initial impulse given by the Herald of our Faith, whilst confined in the heart
                        of faraway Asia, a still greater force was communicated, and a more specific direction
                        given, when the Author of our Faith Himself, having already set foot on the fringes
                        of the continent of Europe, addressed, in His Kitáb-i-Aqdas, from behind the walls
                        of the prison-city of ‘Akká, some of the most celebrated passages of that Book to
                        the Chief Magistrates of the entire American continent, bidding them “<span class="brl-italic">bind with the hands of justice the broken,</span>” and “<span class="brl-italic">crush the oppressor</span>” with the “<span class="brl-italic">rod of the commandments</span>” of their Lord. Unlike the kings of the earth whom He had so boldly condemned in
                        that same Book, unlike the European Sovereigns whom He had either rebuked, warned
                        or denounced, such as the French Emperor, the most powerful monarch of his time; the
                        Conqueror of that monarch; the Heir of the Holy Roman Empire; and the Caliph of Islám;
                        the Rulers of America were not only spared the ominous and emphatic warnings which
                        He uttered against the crowned heads of the world, but were called upon to bring their
                        corrective and healing influence to bear upon the injustices perpetrated by the tyrannical
                        and the ungodly. To this remarkable pronouncement, conferring such distinction upon
                        the sovereign rulers of the Western Hemisphere, must be added not only the passages
                        in which the Author of our Faith clearly foreshadows the revelation of the “<span class="brl-italic">signs of His dominion</span>” in the West, but also the no less significant verbal affirmations which, according
                        to reliable eyewitnesses, He more than once made in regard to the glorious destiny
                        which America was to attain in the days to come.
                     </p>

                        <a id="817068104" class="brl-location"></a>That same impulse was markedly accelerated when the Center of the Covenant Himself,
                        through a series of successive acts, chose to disclose, to an unprecedented extent,
                        the character of the Mission reserved for the followers of Bahá’u’lláh in that continent,
                        and to delineate the tasks whereby that God-given design was to be fulfilled. No sooner
                        had He mounted the helm of the Faith than He unmistakably revealed to His followers
                        His purpose of making the establishment of that Faith in the West, and particularly
                        in the New World, one of the chief objectives of His ministry. No sooner had that
                        great feat been accomplished than He undertook to visit those centers which His disciples
                        had labored to establish, and, through a number of symbolic acts and weighty pronouncements,
                        to pave the way for the inauguration of the collective undertaking He was preparing
                        those disciples to carry out. In the Tablets of the Divine Plan, revealed at a later
                        stage, and in circumstances almost as critical as those which had accompanied the
                        inception of the Faith in the West, and which may be designated as the Charter of
                        the Plan with which He was to entrust them in the evening of His life, He, in a language
                        still more graphic and in terms more definite than those used by either the Báb or
                        Bahá’u’lláh, revealed the high distinction and the glorious work which America, and
                        particularly the United States and Canada, was to achieve in both the Formative and
                        Golden Ages of the Bahá’í Dispensation.

                        <a id="755603488" class="brl-location"></a>His references to the “<span class="brl-italic">extraordinary brilliancy</span>” of the light which His Father’s Revelation was to shed in the West; His prediction
                        that “<span class="brl-italic">the West will have replaced the East</span>” “<span class="brl-italic">through the splendor</span>” of that Faith; His specific prophecies regarding the future of the American continent,
                        as the “<span class="brl-italic">land wherein the splendors of His light shall be revealed</span>” and “<span class="brl-italic">the mysteries of His Faith shall be unveiled,</span>” and which “<span class="brl-italic">will lead all nations spiritually</span>”; His even more specific tribute to the Great Republic of the West which He proclaims
                        to be “<span class="brl-italic">worthy of being the first to build the Tabernacle of the Most Great Peace and proclaim
                           the oneness of mankind,</span>” to be “<span class="brl-italic">equipped and empowered to accomplish that which will adorn the pages of history, to
                           become the envy of the world, and be blest in both the East and the West</span>”; His yet more startling words addressed to the followers of the Faith in that Republic,
                        referring to them as “<span class="brl-italic">apostles of Bahá’u’lláh,</span>” characterizing their mission as “<span class="brl-italic">unspeakably glorious,</span>” and assuring them that “<span class="brl-italic">should success crown your enterprise … the throne of the Kingdom of God will, in the
                           plenitude of its majesty and glory, be firmly established</span>”; and finally, His soul-stirring assertion that “<span class="brl-italic">the moment this Divine Message is carried forward by the American believers from the
                           shores of America, and is propagated through the continents of Europe, of Asia, of
                           Africa and of Australasia, and as far as the islands of the Pacific, this community
                           will find itself securely established upon the throne of an everlasting dominion,</span>” and that “<span class="brl-italic">the whole earth</span>” will “<span class="brl-italic">resound with the praises of its majesty and greatness</span>”—all these, in conjunction with the explicit and detailed instructions embodied in
                        His Tablets, in connection with the execution of their mission, may be regarded as
                        having fixed the pattern, and revealed a measure of the glory, of the Plan itself,
                        which, after His ascension, was to be collectively and formally prosecuted.

                        <a id="227369192" class="brl-location"></a>The creation of the administrative machinery of the Faith, according to the precepts
                        laid down in ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Will and Testament, and on which, during the opening years
                        of its Formative Age, the resources and attention of the trustees of the Plan were
                        chiefly concentrated, provided, after several years of assiduous labor, the agencies
                        for its proper and systematic execution. The first stage of that enterprise, which
                        had been held in abeyance, for well-nigh twenty years, while the administrative institutions
                        of the Faith were slowly taking shape and were being perfected, was finally launched
                        during the last decade of that same century whose opening years will be associated
                        with the earliest though veiled intimation of the phenomenal destiny which the followers
                        of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh in the New World are to fulfill. The successful consummation
                        of the first stage of that long-deferred Mission, made possible through the brilliant
                        execution of a Seven Year Plan, embracing the entire Western Hemisphere, synchronized
                        with, and was befittingly commemorated through, the historic celebrations that marked
                        the termination of that century.<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#482304346">81</a></sup>

                        <a id="440518378" class="brl-location"></a>The opening decade of the second Bahá’í century coincides with the launching of the
                        second Seven Year Plan,<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#212090711">82</a></sup> destined alike to consolidate the exploits that have shed such luster on the last

                        to the shores of the Old World, and to communicate, through the operation of its regenerative
                        power, its healing influence to the peoples of the most afflicted, impoverished and
                        agitated continent of the globe. We who stand on the threshold of this gigantic and
                        twofold undertaking are unable to discern the exact course which its immediate operation,
                        both on the home front and in fields far from the scene of its earliest victories,
                        is destined to take, the setbacks it may suffer, or the triumphs it must ultimately
                        achieve. The objectives, however, which must orientate its prosecutors, and arouse
                        them to a higher pitch of concerted endeavor, are clearly defined, and by no means
                        beyond their collective power to achieve.

                        of the Faith throughout the states and provinces of the North American continent and
                        throughout Latin America, and to proclaim its truths and principles to the masses,
                        should be relentlessly pursued, whilst the range of the operation of the Plan is being
                        steadily enlarged. The administrative centers—foci at which the ever-expanding activities
                        of a rising Order must converge—whose total number had not exceeded forty at the time
                        of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s visit to America, which at the inception of the first Seven Year
                        Plan had risen to three hundred, and had swelled to over a thousand ere the expiry
                        of the first Bahá’í century, should, through resolute effort and careful planning,
                        be continually and speedily multiplied. Particular care should be constantly exercised
                        to enable the groups scattered throughout the length and breadth of the states and
                        provinces of the United States and Canada to attain Assembly status, and assume gradually
                        the responsibilities and functions assigned to them in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas and the Tablets
                        of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. A corresponding increase in the number of such centers throughout
                        both Central and South America should likewise be aimed at. Bolder measures designed
                        to proclaim the verities of the Faith, its tenets, its claims and the purpose of its
                        institutions, through the press and radio, through displays, exhibits and conferences,
                        and through a wider dissemination of its literature in English, Spanish and Portuguese,
                        as well as a more convincing presentation of its aims and teachings to the leaders
                        of public opinion, should, moreover, be seriously and systematically undertaken not
                        only in the mother country but also throughout the Latin republics where the structural
                        basis of Bahá’u’lláh’s embryonic Order has already been established.

                        a special effort should be exerted to bring to a final conclusion the construction
                        of the most holy Temple which will ever be erected by the followers of the Faith of
                        Bahá’u’lláh, and whose inception, forty-three years ago, synchronized with the erection
                        in the city of ‘I<u>sh</u>qábád of the first Ma<u>sh</u>riqu’l-A<u>dh</u>kár of the Bahá’í world. The completion of the interior ornamentation of the Temple,

                        it was ordained, and coinciding with the fiftieth anniversary of its inception, will,
                        in itself, pave the way for the gradual erection of those dependencies which are designed
                        to supplement the functions which the Central Edifice is destined to perform, and
                        whose future development must needs be provided for during successive stages in the

                        should be devoted to the provision of the necessary means whereby the newly fledged
                        centers in the Dominion of Canada and throughout the republics of Latin America can
                        be coordinated and further consolidated, through the formation of three National Spiritual
                        Assemblies, designed to participate in time in the international elections that must
                        precede the constitution of the First Universal House of Justice. The erection of
                        these three pillars, raising to eleven the number of existing National Spiritual Assemblies,
                        which are to be designated in future as Secondary Houses of Justice, and are designed
                        to support the highest legislative body in the administrative hierarchy of the Faith,
                        will, as the Divine Plan continues to unfold, be supplemented by the formation of
                        similar bodies which, as they multiply, will, of necessity, broaden the basis, and
                        reinforce the representative character, of the supreme elective Institution which,
                        in conjunction with the institution of Guardianship, must direct and coordinate the
                        activities of a world-encircling Faith. Through the formation of these National Spiritual
                        Assemblies, as the implications of the Divine Plan gradually unfold in the coming
                        years, the American Bahá’í community will, in addition to its missionary activities
                        throughout five continents and the islands of the seven seas, be contributing directly
                        to the laying of the foundation, and hastening the formation, of an institution which,
                        when constituted, will have consummated the threefold process involved in the erection
                        of the total structure of the Administrative Order of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh.

                        believers, and act as intermediaries between the various groups which, as the present
                        Plan develops, must evolve into Spiritual Assemblies; through the vigorous dissemination
                        of literature, properly translated, promptly printed, and comprehensive in range,
                        in French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, German, Dutch and each of the Scandinavian
                        languages; through a steady process of concentration on a few receptive souls, who
                        can be relied upon to embrace, wholeheartedly and with alacrity, the truth of the
                        Faith, identify themselves unreservedly with its tenets, actively support its institutions,
                        and join in forming its initial Assemblies; through the persistent efforts, at a later
                        stage, of a considerable number of settlers who, joining forces with the original
                        pioneers and the native and newly enrolled believers, will provide the necessary requisites
                        for the constitution of properly functioning Local Assemblies; through the participation,
                        as the situation on the continent improves and the restrictions are relaxed, of these
                        settlers, itinerant teachers, native and isolated believers in conferences and organizations,
                        humanitarian, educational and otherwise, designed to promote ends akin to our own;
                        through the liberal supply of funds to those who have forsaken their homes and kindred
                        in the New World, and journeyed so far afield in the service of both their Faith and
                        their fellowmen; through the exertion of a special effort, as the present Plan approaches
                        its close and the general condition in most European countries improves, aimed at
                        securing, through the radio and the press, the widest possible publicity for the Faith,
                        its tenets and institutions, to serve as a means of reinforcing the number of its
                        avowed promoters and of consolidating the basis of its evolving institutions—through
                        these, and similar measures which the American National Spiritual Assembly and its
                        European Teaching Committee may initiate and promote, the American Bahá’í Community
                        must demonstrate, in this new field of their intercontinental enterprise, an initiative,
                        a tenacity, a resourcefulness, a self-sacrifice and an audacity comparable to, and
                        even exceeding, the qualities evinced by those who, ever since the inception of the
                        Faith in the West, have, haphazardly, single-handed and with no organization to sustain
                        them, labored with such fidelity and devotion in various countries throughout that
                        continent.

                        <a id="508410662" class="brl-location"></a>The first century of the Bahá’í Era witnessed in darkest Persia the birth of the Faith,
                        as well as the establishment of the Administrative Order—the Child of that Faith—an
                        Order which, cradled in the heart of the North American continent, has already succeeded,
                        in less than a decade and in direct consequence of the initial operation of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s
                        Plan, and through the concerted, the sustained, and richly blessed efforts of the
                        champion-builders of that Order, in spreading out its roots and in rearing its institutions
                        in no less than twenty republics throughout the length and breadth of the Western
                        Hemisphere. The second century is destined to witness a tremendous deployment and
                        a notable consolidation of the forces working towards the worldwide development of
                        that Order, as well as the first stirrings of that World Order, of which the present
                        Administrative System is at once the precursor, the nucleus and pattern—an Order which,
                        as it slowly crystallizes and radiates its benign influence over the entire planet,
                        will proclaim at once the coming of age of the whole human race, as well as the maturity
                        of the Faith itself, the progenitor of that Order. As the Plan bequeathed by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
                        unfolds, through successive decades of the present century, its measureless potentialities,
                        and gathers within the field of its operations nation after nation in successive continents
                        of the globe, it will be increasingly recognized not only as the most potent agency
                        for the development of the world Administrative System, but also as a primary factor
                        in the birth and efflorescence of the World Order itself in both the East and the
                        West.

                        <a id="355979230" class="brl-location"></a>The first Seven Year Plan, ushered in on the eve of the greatest conflict that has
                        ever shaken the human race, has, despite six years of chaos and tribulation, been
                        crowned with a success far exceeding the most sanguine hopes of its ardent promoters.
                        Within so short a period, during such troublous years, such exploits were achieved
                        as will forever illuminate the pages of Bahá’í history. The exterior ornamentation
                        of the House of Worship was completed sixteen months before the appointed time. The
                        administrative basis of the Faith was laid in every virgin state and province of the
                        North American continent. The number of Spiritual Assemblies in the United States
                        and Canada was almost doubled. No less than fourteen republics of Latin America were
                        provided with such Assemblies. Active groups began to function in the remaining republics,
                        raising thereby the number of sovereign states within the pale of the Faith to sixty.
                        Extension work in which the newly constituted Assemblies were vigorously participating
                        was initiated. Two of the newly fledged Assemblies in Latin America, as well as a
                        considerable number in the United States, were incorporated. An international school
                        to provide training for Bahá’í teachers in Central and South America was founded.
                        Considerable literature in Spanish and Portuguese was disseminated. Newspaper and
                        radio publicity, teacher training courses, and Bahá’í youth symposiums were inaugurated.
                        A distributing center of Bahá’í literature for Latin America was established in the
                        capital of Argentina, and the outposts of the Faith, in the Western Hemisphere, were
                        pushed as far north as Anchorage in Alaska, in the vicinity of the Artic Circle, and
                        as far as the extremity of Chile, to Magallanes, the world’s southernmost city.

                        upheaval, must, despite the great confusion that still prevails, the spiritual torpor,
                        the disillusionment, the embitterment, the political and social restlessness that
                        still afflict the human race, meet, as it gathers momentum and multiplies its agencies
                        across the ocean, in lands and amidst races that have borne, for the most part, the
                        brunt of this dire and bloody contest, with a success no less startling and complete
                        than that which rewarded the self-sacrifice, the vigilance and the strenuous labors
                        of those who inaugurated the initial phase of this glorious Mission. Might not this
                        second and still greater adventure, undertaken by the trustees of a God-given Mandate,
                        demonstrate in both hemispheres, despite the prodigious scale on which it is launched,
                        such prodigies of service as will carry its prosecutors far beyond their avowed objectives,
                        and eclipse, through the wisdom, the valor and the exploits of those pioneers and
                        administrators immediately responsible for its planning and execution, the splendor

                        the comforting, the sustaining words enshrined for all time in those epoch-making
                        Tablets wherein the unerring pen of their Master has traced the course of their Mission:
                        “<span class="brl-italic">May America become the distributing center of spiritual enlightenment, and all the
                           world receive this heavenly blessing! For America has developed powers and capacities
                           greater and more wonderful than other nations … May the inhabitants of this country
                           … rise from their present material attainments to such a height that heavenly illumination
                           may stream from this center to all the peoples of the world.</span>” And again: “<span class="brl-italic">O ye Apostles of Bahá’u’lláh! May my life be sacrificed for you! … Behold the portals
                           which Bahá’u’lláh hath opened before you. Consider how exalted and lofty is the station
                           you are destined to attain; how unique the favors with which you have been endowed</span>” … “<span class="brl-italic">The full measure of your success is as yet unrevealed, its significance still unapprehended.
                           Erelong ye will, with your own eyes, witness how brilliantly every one of you, even
                           as a shining star, will radiate in the firmament of your country the light of Divine
                           Guidance, and will bestow upon its people the glory of an everlasting life … The range
                           of your future achievements still remains undisclosed. I fervently hope that in the
                           near future the whole earth may be stirred and shaken by the results of your achievements.</span>” “<span class="brl-italic">The Almighty will no doubt grant you the help of His grace, will invest you with the
                           tokens of His might, and will endue your souls with the sustaining power of His holy
                           Spirit.</span>” And again: “<span class="brl-italic">Be not concerned with the smallness of your numbers, neither be oppressed by the multitude
                           of an unbelieving world</span>” … “<span class="brl-italic">Exert yourselves; your mission is unspeakably glorious. Should success crown your
                           enterprise, America will assuredly evolve into a center from which waves of spiritual
                           power will emanate, and the throne of the Kingdom of God will, in the plenitude of
                           its majesty and glory, be firmly established</span>” … “<span class="brl-italic">The hope which ‘Abdu’l-Bahá cherishes for you is that the same success which has attended
                           your efforts in America may crown your endeavors in other parts of the world, that
                           through you the fame of the Cause of God may be diffused throughout the East and the
                           West and the advent of the Kingdom of the Lord of Hosts be proclaimed in all the five
                           continents of the globe … Thus far ye have been untiring in your labors. Let your
                           exertions henceforth increase a thousandfold. Summon the people in these countries,
                           capitals, islands, assemblies and churches to enter the Abhá Kingdom. The scope of
                           your exertions must needs be extended. The wider its range, the more striking will
                           be the evidence of Divine assistance.</span>” And finally, this apocalyptic vision of the consummation of the task entrusted to
                        the American Bahá’í Community, as evoked by that same Pen in those same Tablets: “<span class="brl-italic">The moment this Divine Message is carried forward by the American believers from the
                           shores of America, and is propagated through the continents of Europe, of Asia, of
                           Africa and of Australasia, and as far as the islands of the Pacific, this community
                           will find itself securely established upon the throne of an everlasting dominion.
                           Then will all the peoples of the world witness that this community is spiritually
                           illumined and divinely guided. Then will the whole earth resound with the praises
                           of its majesty and greatness.</span>”

                        <a id="481021950" class="brl-location"></a>What greater reward can crown the labors of that community, now launched on the second
                        stage of its world mission, than that the consummation of the second Seven Year Plan
                        should coincide with the celebrations commemorating the centenary of the “<span class="brl-italic">Year Nine,</span>” the year which alike marked the termination of the Bábí Dispensation, and signalized
                        the birth of Bahá’u’lláh’s prophetic Mission? It was at a time when the Faith for
                        which the Báb had suffered and died was hovering on the brink of extinction, when
                        Bahá’u’lláh lay wrapped in the gloom of the Síyáh-<u>Ch</u>ál of Ṭihrán, His feet in stocks, His neck freighted with chains, and surrounded by
                        vile and wretched criminals, that the auspicious year 1269 A.H., acclaimed by the
                        Báb as the “<span class="brl-italic">Year Nine,</span>” dawned upon the world, ushering in the most glorious and momentous stage in the
                        Heroic Age of the greatest religious Dispensation in the spiritual history of mankind.
                        To that year He had referred as the year in which “<span class="brl-italic">the realities of the created things</span>” will “<span class="brl-italic">be made manifest,</span>” the year in which mankind “<span class="brl-italic">will attain unto all good,</span>” in which the “<span class="brl-italic">Bayán,</span>” as yet “<span class="brl-italic">in the stage of seed,</span>” will manifest “<span class="brl-italic">its ultimate perfection,</span>” in which the “<span class="brl-italic">embryo of the Faith will attain the station of ‘the most comely of forms,’</span>” and in which “<span class="brl-italic">a new creation</span>” will be beheld. It was in that same year that the “<span class="brl-italic">third woe,</span>” as anticipated by St. John the Divine, quickly succeeded the second. To that same
                        year <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u>  Aḥmad-i-Aḥsá’í, who had heralded the Faith of the Báb, had alluded as the year “after
                        Ḥín” (68), when, according to his written testimony, the “mystery” of the Cause of
                        God would be “manifested,” and the “secret” of His Message “divulged.” It was in that
                        same year that, according to Bahá’u’lláh Himself, “<span class="brl-italic">the requisite number of pure, of wholly consecrated, and sanctified souls</span>” had been “<span class="brl-italic">most secretly consummated.</span>”
                     </p>

                        <a id="592671541" class="brl-location"></a>It was in such dramatic circumstances, recalling the experience of Moses when face
                        to face with the Burning Bush in the wilderness of Sinai, the successive visions of
                        Zoroaster, the opening of the heavens and the descent of the Dove upon Christ in the
                        Jordan, the cry of Gabriel heard by Muḥammad in the Cave of Híra, and the dream of
                        the Báb in which the blood of the Imám Ḥusayn touched and sanctified His lips, that
                        Bahá’u’lláh, He “around Whom the Point of the Bayán hath revolved,” and the Vehicle
                        of the greatest Revelation the world has yet seen, received the first intimation of
                        His sublime Mission, and that a ministry which, alike in its duration and fecundity,
                        is unsurpassed in the religious history of mankind, was inaugurated. It was on that
                        occasion that the “<span class="brl-italic">Most Great Spirit,</span>” as designated by Bahá’u’lláh Himself, revealed itself to Him, in the form of a “<span class="brl-italic">Maiden,</span>” and bade Him “<span class="brl-italic">lift up</span>” His “<span class="brl-italic">voice between earth and heaven</span>”—that same Spirit which, in the Zoroastrian, the Mosaic, the Christian, and Muḥammadan
                        Dispensations, had been respectively symbolized by the “Sacred Fire,” the “Burning
                        Bush,” the “Dove,” and the “Angel Gabriel.”

                        <a id="064628203" class="brl-location"></a>“<span class="brl-italic">One night, in a dream,</span>” Bahá’u’lláh Himself, recounting His soul-shaking experience of the first stirrings
                        of His prophetic Mission, in the Year Nine, in that abominable pit, has written, “<span class="brl-italic">these exalted words were heard on every side: ‘Verily, We shall render Thee victorious
                           by Thyself and by Thy Pen. Grieve Thou not for that which hath befallen Thee, neither
                           be Thou afraid, for Thou art in safety. Erelong will God raise up the treasures of
                           the earth—men who will aid Thee through Thyself and through Thy Name, wherewith God
                           hath revived the hearts of such as have recognized Him.’</span>” And again, “<span class="brl-italic">During the days I lay in the prison of Ṭihrán, though the galling weight of the chains
                           and the stench-filled air allowed Me but little sleep, still in those infrequent moments
                           of slumber I felt as if something flowed from the crown of My head over My breast,
                           even as a mighty torrent that precipitateth itself upon the earth from the summit
                           of a lofty mountain. Every limb of My body would, as a result, be set afire. At such
                           moments My tongue recited what no man could bear to hear.</span>”

                        <a id="809003224" class="brl-location"></a>What still greater reward could await those who, inspired by the success achieved
                        by the prosecutors of the second Seven Year Plan, will have arisen to carry forward
                        to a triumphant conclusion the third phase of the Mission entrusted to them by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá,
                        than that their prodigious labors, having embraced territories far beyond the confines
                        of the continents of Europe and of America, should climax in, and be worthily commemorated
                        through, the worldwide celebrations of the “Most Great Festival,” the “King of Festivals,”
                        the “Festival of God” Himself—the Festival associated with the accession of Him Who
                        is the Lord of the Kingdom to the throne of everlasting glory, and with the formal
                        assumption by Him of His prophetic office? What greater reward than that the consummation
                        of the third Seven Year Plan, marking the close of the first, and signalizing the
                        opening of the second, epoch in the evolution of the Divine Plan, should synchronize
                        with that greatest of all Jubilees, related to the year 1335, mentioned by Daniel
                        in the last chapter of His Book, and associated by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá with the world triumph
                        of His Father’s Faith? What greater glory than that those who have brought this initial
                        epoch in the resistless march of a world-embracing Plan to a triumphant termination
                        should be made to feel that they, and those gone before them, have, through their
                        collective, their sustained, and heroic endeavors, organized through three successive
                        stages, and covering a span of almost a quarter of a century, been vouchsafed by the
                        Almighty the privilege of contributing, more than any other community consciously
                        laboring in the service of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh, to this blissful consummation,
                        and to have played a preponderating role in the world triumph of its institutions?

                        <a id="683487321" class="brl-location"></a>Dearly beloved friends! It is not for us, at this crucial hour, to delve into the
                        future, to speculate on the possibilities of the Plan and its orientation, to conjecture
                        on its impact on the unfoldment of an embryonic World Order, or to dwell on the glories
                        and triumphs which it may hold in store, or to seek to delineate the mysterious course
                        which a God-given Mission, impelled by forces beyond our power to predict or appraise,
                        may pursue. To try to obtain a clear view of the shape of things to come would be
                        premature, inasmuch as the glittering prizes to be won are directly dependent on the
                        measure of success which the combined efforts that are now being exerted must yield.
                        Ours is the duty to fix our gaze with undeviating attention on the duties and responsibilities
                        confronting us at this present hour, to concentrate our resources, both material and
                        spiritual, on the tasks that lie immediately ahead, to ensure that no time is wasted,
                        that no opportunity is missed, that no obligation is evaded, that no task is half-heartedly
                        performed, that no decision is procrastinated. The task summoning us to a challenge,
                        unprecedented in its gravity and force, is too vast and sacred, the time too short,
                        the hour too perilous, the workers too few, the call too insistent, the resources
                        too inadequate, for us to allow these precious and fleeting hours to slip from our
                        grasp, and to suffer the prizes within our reach to be endangered or forfeited. So
                        much depends upon us, so pregnant with possibilities is the present stage in the evolution
                        of the Plan, that great and small, individuals, groups and Assemblies, white and colored,
                        young and old, neophytes and veterans, settlers, pioneers, itinerant teachers and
                        administrators, as isolated believers, as organizers of groups, and as contributors
                        to the formation of Local or National Assemblies, as builders of the Temple, as laborers
                        on the home teaching front, or in Latin America, or in the new transatlantic field
                        of service—all, without exception and in every sphere of activity, however modest,
                        restricted or inconspicuous, must participate and labor, assiduously and continually,
                        until every ounce of our energy is spent, until, tired but blissful, our promised
                        harvest is brought in, and our pledge to our Beloved fully redeemed.
                     </p>

                        <a id="988050800" class="brl-location"></a>However dark the outlook, however laborious the task, however strange and inhospitable
                        the environment, however vast the distances that must be traversed, however scarce
                        the amenities of life, however irksome the means of travel, however annoying the restrictions,
                        however listless and confused the minds of the peoples and races contacted, however
                        trying the setbacks that may be suffered, we must, under no circumstances, either
                        falter or flinch. Our reliance on the unfailing grace of an all-loving, all-preserving,
                        ever-sustaining, ever-watchful Providence, must, however much we may be buffeted by
                        circumstances, remain unshaken until the very end. Shall we not, when hardships seethe
                        about us, and our hearts momentarily quail, recall the ardent desire so poignantly
                        voiced by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in those immortal Tablets that enshrine forever His last wishes
                        for His chosen disciples: “O that I could travel, even though on foot and in the utmost
                        poverty, to these regions, and, raising the call of ‘Yá Bahá’u’l-Abhá’ in cities,
                        villages, mountains, deserts and oceans, promote the Divine teachings! This, alas,
                        I cannot do. How intensely I deplore it! Please God, ye may achieve it.”
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="353855314" class="brl-location"></a>To be privileged to render, in His stead, on so colossal a scale, at such a challenging
                        hour, and in the service of so sublime a Plan, so great and enduring a service, is
                        a bounty which we can never adequately appraise. We stand too close to the noble edifice
                        our hands are rearing, the din and tumult into which a war-devastated world is now
                        plunged are too distracting, our own share in the furtherance of those global aims,
                        tasks and problems that are increasingly absorbing the attention of mankind and its
                        leaders is as yet too circumscribed, for us to be in a position to evaluate the contribution
                        which we, as the executors of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s Mandate, as the champion-builders of
                        Bahá’u’lláh’s Order, as the torchbearers of a civilization of which that Order is
                        the mainspring and precursor, are now being led, through the inscrutable dispensations
                        of an almighty Providence, to make to the world triumph of our Faith, as well as to
                        the ultimate redemption of all mankind.

                        <a id="530842247" class="brl-location"></a>Great have been the blessings, and divers the bestowals, vouchsafed to this community
                        ever since the compelling will of a loving Master called it into being, and raised
                        it up for the glory and honor of His Father’s Faith. Unnumbered have been the marks
                        of solicitude which, down the years, He showered upon it, as He nursed it in its infancy,
                        as He fostered its growth, as He sent forth His messengers and communicated His written
                        instructions, to initiate it into the mysteries of His Cause, as He vitalized it through
                        personal contact with His own dynamic and vibrant personality, as He consecrated,
                        through a series of significant acts, the initial activities which He Himself had
                        enabled it to inaugurate, as He invested it, at a later stage, in the evening of His
                        life, with that primacy that was to empower it to launch the Plan which He had conceived
                        for its future development, as He, through the sustaining power of His spirit from
                        on high, assisted it to erect the framework of those institutions that were to safeguard
                        its unfoldment and canalize its energies, as He led it forward to embark upon the
                        first stage of His own revealed Plan which was to enable it to achieve such exploits
                        and garner such a harvest in the virgin territories of the New World, and as He, with
                        that same watchful and loving care, is now marshaling its forces and sounding the
                        signal for a still greater and more brilliant deployment of those forces, at a time
                        of great commotion and distress, in one of the most agitated storm-centers of the
                        world.

                        <a id="683120974" class="brl-location"></a>Strange, indeed, as we look back over the last fifty years that have witnessed the
                        creation and unfoldment of so powerful an agency for the execution of Bahá’u’lláh’s
                        purpose for mankind, that he who had first raised his voice in public on behalf of
                        so mighty a Faith should have sprung from the ranks, and been recognized as one of
                        the leading representatives, of that narrow and hostile ecclesiastical order which,
                        as the Faith advances and storms still greater heights, will increasingly launch against
                        it its determined attacks. Stranger still that he whom posterity will recognize to
                        have been the founder of that Faith in the Western Hemisphere, whom the Center of
                        the Covenant, in recognition of so signal a service, had acclaimed as “Bahá’s Peter”
                        and “the Second Columbus,”<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#052506551">83</a></sup> should have, in his vanity and ambition, deserted the Fold he had labored to gather,
                        should have allied himself with the Archbreaker of the Covenant of Bahá’u’lláh, and
                        remained, until the end of his life, a sworn and bitter enemy of the One Who had entrusted
                        him with such a holy and historic errand, and conferred upon him such glowing tributes.
                        More extraordinary still that he who had been instrumental in carrying the Tablets
                        of the Divine Plan from the One Who had revealed them to those into whose care they
                        were to be committed, who had enjoyed, for so long and so intimately, near access
                        to his Master as amanuensis, companion and interpreter,<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#934305943">84</a></sup> should have been blinded by his inordinate ambition, and should have arisen, with
                        all the resources at his disposal, to attack and undermine the institutions of an
                        Order which, springing from the authentic Will of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, had been designed
                        by Him to be the chief instrument for the vigorous prosecution of that Plan and the
                        fulfillment of its ultimate purpose.

                        the ranks of kings, princes and ecclesiastics have repeatedly launched against it,
                        and the violent internal tests that have shaken it for more than a century, and the

                        its ramifications to the four corners of the earth, and launched its systematic campaigns

                        labors, of the valiant community that has arisen to achieve what posterity will regard
                        as the greatest collective enterprise, not only in the history of the community itself,
                        but in the annals of the Faith with which it stands identified.

                        <a id="154401214" class="brl-location"></a>The initial success of the enterprise which has been so auspiciously launched, the
                        enthusiasm which it has already engendered throughout Latin America, the hopes it
                        has aroused amid the suffering and scattered believers in war-torn Europe, the feelings
                        of admiration and envy it has excited throughout several communities in the Bahá’í
                        world in both the East and the West, augur well for the future course of its operation,
                        and foreshadow the splendor of the victories which its consummation must witness.
                        The forces that have been released through the birth of the Plan must be directed
                        into the most effective channels, the spirit that has been kindled must be continually
                        nourished, the facilities at the disposal of its organizers must be fully utilized,
                        each and every barrier that may obstruct its expansion must be determinedly removed,
                        every assistance which Bahá’í communities in various lands may wish, or be able, to
                        offer, should be wholeheartedly welcomed, every measure that will serve to reinforce
                        the bonds uniting the newly fledged communities in the Latin world, and to stimulate
                        the movement, and raise the spirits, of itinerant teachers and settlers laboring in
                        the continent of Europe, must be speedily undertaken, if the colossal task, which
                        in the course of seven brief years must be carried out, is to be befittingly consummated.

                        their God-given Mission, and throughout every stage in the irresistible and divinely

                        may surround the little band that must act as a vanguard to the host which must, in
                        the years to come, spiritually raise up the sorely ravaged continent of Europe. None
                        of these, however fierce, sinister or unyielding they may appear, must be allowed
                        to deflect the protagonists of a God-impelled Plan from the course which ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
                        has chosen for them, and which the agencies of a firmly established, laboriously erected
                        Administrative Order are now enabling them to effectively pursue.

                        American Bahá’í community, which has already abundantly demonstrated its capacity
                        to carry to a triumphant conclusion the initial stage of the Plan conceived by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá,
                        must equally—nay even more convincingly—prove to the entire Bahá’í world its inflexible
                        determination and undoubted ability to discharge befittingly whatever responsibilities
                        the constant evolution of the Plan may impose upon its members under any circumstances
                        and in whatever continent of the globe. As the field of their historic labors steadily
                        widens, as the implications of their high mission become more apparent, as the complexity
                        of their task increases, as the agencies designed to facilitate and accelerate its
                        execution multiply, the members of this community must, individually as well as collectively,
                        redouble their efforts, evince a nobler spirit of self-sacrifice, display greater
                        resourcefulness, unity, initiative, steadfastness and enterprise, rise to loftier
                        heights of heroism and self-abnegation, and establish, more convincingly than ever,
                        their right to be regarded as the worthy champions of a glorious Cause, the principal
                        builders of a unique Order, and the chosen trustees and executors of a divinely conceived
                        Plan.

                        the outposts of the Faith in Western Europe; lay, on a definite and unassailable basis,
                        the foundations of new and flourishing communities; disseminate, energetically, and
                        on a far more extensive scale, the literature of the Faith in all the languages which
                        the execution of the Plan, at its present stage, demands; collaborate more closely
                        with the two National Assemblies and their subsidiary agencies already functioning
                        in that continent; initiate, wisely and patiently, whatever measures may be required
                        to further the purposes of the Plan; and surmount, at whatever cost, every obstacle

                        privilege of struggling in the forefront of battle, either at home or abroad, theirs
                        is the no less meritorious task, to aid by every means in their power, whether through
                        financial assistance, constant support and encouragement, the supply of literature
                        or the appointment of deputies, the little band of their heroic brethren, who have
                        assumed so preponderating a share of the responsibilities now facing the entire community:
                        all, without exception, without reservation, without further delay, must participate.
                        Each and every one, to the fullest extent of his or her ability, and however distracting
                        the prevailing circumstances, or circumscribed the means, must arise to contribute
                        to the success of this new enterprise that will at once safeguard the fruits already
                        garnered through the successful conclusion of the first stage of the Divine Plan,
                        and enable its prosecutors to launch, at the appointed time, the third and a still
                        more glorious stage in its evolution.

                        of those who, in so short a time, in such distant fields, over so wide an area, and
                        in the midst of a people so alien in temperament, language and custom, have won such
                        conspicuous victories for their beloved Faith, and laid so enduring a foundation for
                        its nascent institutions.

                        a task infinitely more meritorious, and considerably richer in its potentialities.
                        To fail, at this critical juncture, to rise to the height of the occasion, would jeopardize
                        the colossal work so painstakingly achieved in the course of many long years, and
                        irretrievably shatter the hopes for the early opening of the third and most shining

                                       had outlined for the successful completion of the Temple enterprise. The five steps,
                                       announced in <span class="brl-italic">Bahá’í News</span>, no. 110 (Sept. 1937), were as follows: (1) Preliminary investigations were to be
                                       expedited. (2) A generous donation of $100,000 by Siegfried Schopflocher was to be
                                       used to facilitate the immediate signature of a contract for the next unit of exterior
                                       ornamentation. (3) The National Spiritual Assembly was to make a nationwide appeal
                                       to the entire community to ensure the uninterrupted completion of the first unit of
                                       exterior ornamentation and the accumulation of sufficient funds to place the final
                                       contract without delay. (4) The final contract was to be signed as soon as half of
                                       the required sum for its fulfillment was available in the national treasury. (5) The
                                       National Assembly was to reemphasize the supreme obligation of the triumphant conclusion
                                       of so vital a part of the American believers’ twofold task by May 1944.<span class="brl-returntotext"> <a href="#563147998">↩</a>

                                       at the time this message was written. In Iran, Bahá’í marriages were not recognized
                                       as legitimate, yet the Bahá’ís were given no acceptable means to legitimize their
                                       unions in the eyes of the law without compromising their faith. Those who were married
                                       according to Bahá’í law were often arrested and either fined or imprisoned. There
                                       were also restrictions against holding Bahá’í meetings, Bahá’í records were occasionally
                                       confiscated by government officials, and some believers were banished from their hometowns.
                                       In Iraq, some Bahá’ís were accused of being communists and were arrested and tried,
                                       then acquitted. In ‘I<u>sh</u>qábád Bahá’ís were arrested, their homes were searched, and Bahá’í records and literature
                                       were confiscated. Furthermore, the Ma<u>sh</u>riqu’l-A<u>dh</u>kár of that city was confiscated for government use. Many of the believers were exiled
                                       and sought refuge in Iran, only to be denied work. In the Caucasus, all Bahá’í administrative
                                       institutions had to be disbanded, and many Bahá’ís were exiled to Siberia. Bahá’ís
                                       in Egypt had recently experienced outbreaks of public violence in connection with
                                       their efforts to give proper Bahá’í burial to their dead. In Nazi Germany, the Faith
                                       was officially banned and its activities were forbidden.<span class="brl-returntotext"> <a href="#959755823">↩</a>
