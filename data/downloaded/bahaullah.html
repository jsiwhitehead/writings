                     <span class="brl-uppercase brl-text-larger1">May 29, 1992</span>, marks the centenary of the passing of Bahá’u’lláh. His vision of humanity as one
                     people and of the earth as a common homeland, dismissed out of hand by the world leaders
                     to whom it was first enunciated over a hundred years ago, has today become the focus
                     of human hope. Equally inescapable is the collapse of moral and social order, which
                     this same declaration foresaw with awesome clarity.

                     life and work. Prepared at the request of the Universal House of Justice, trustee
                     of the global undertaking which the events of a century ago set in motion, it offers
                     a perspective on the feeling of confidence with which Bahá’ís the world over contemplate
                     the future of our planet and our race.

                        <span class="brl-uppercase">As the new millennium approaches</span>, the crucial need of the human race is to find a unifying vision of the nature of
                        man and society. For the past century humanity’s response to this impulse has driven
                        a succession of ideological upheavals that have convulsed our world and that appear
                        now to have exhausted themselves. The passion invested in the struggle, despite its
                        disheartening results, testifies to the depth of the need. For, without a common conviction
                        about the course and direction of human history, it is inconceivable that foundations
                        can be laid for a global society to which the mass of humankind can commit themselves.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="555510219" class="brl-location"></a>Such a vision unfolds in the writings of Bahá’u’lláh, the nineteenth-century prophetic
                        figure whose growing influence is the most remarkable development of contemporary
                        religious history. Born in Persia, November 12, 1817, Bahá’u’lláh<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#604397524">1</a></sup> began at age 27 an undertaking that has gradually captured the imagination and loyalty
                        of several million people from virtually every race, culture, class, and nation on
                        earth. The phenomenon is one that has no reference points in the contemporary world,
                        but is associated rather with climactic changes of direction in the collective past
                        of the human race. For Bahá’u’lláh claimed to be no less than the Messenger of God
                        to the age of human maturity, the Bearer of a Divine Revelation that fulfills the
                        promises made in earlier religions, and that will generate the spiritual nerves and
                        sinews for the unification of the peoples of the world.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="493295392" class="brl-location"></a>If they were to do nothing else, the effects which Bahá’u’lláh’s life and writings
                        have already had should command the earnest attention of anyone who believes that
                        human nature is fundamentally spiritual and that the coming organization of our planet
                        must be informed by this aspect of reality. The documentation lies open to general
                        scrutiny. For the first time in history humanity has available a detailed and verifiable
                        record of the birth of an independent religious system and of the life of its Founder.
                        Equally accessible is the record of the response that the new faith has evoked, through
                        the emergence of a global community which can already justly claim to represent a
                        microcosm of the human race.<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#669453158">2</a></sup>

                        <a id="645561003" class="brl-location"></a>During the earlier decades of this century, this development was relatively obscure.
                        Bahá’u’lláh’s writings forbid the aggressive proselytism through which many religious
                        messages have been widely promulgated. Further, the priority which the Bahá’í community
                        gave to the establishment of groups at the local level throughout the entire planet
                        militated against the early emergence of large concentrations of adherents in any
                        one country or the mobilization of resources required for large-scale programs of
                        public information. Arnold Toynbee, intrigued by phenomena that might represent the
                        emergence of a new universal religion, noted in the 1950s that the Bahá’í Faith was
                        then about as familiar to the average educated Westerner as Christianity had been
                        to the corresponding class in the Roman empire during the second century A.D.<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#888160287">3</a></sup>
                        
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="079465612" class="brl-location"></a>In more recent years, as the Bahá’í community’s numbers have rapidly increased in
                        many countries, the situation has changed dramatically. There is now virtually no
                        area in the world where the pattern of life taught by Bahá’u’lláh is not taking root.
                        The respect which the community’s social and economic development projects are beginning
                        to win in governmental, academic, and United Nations circles further reinforces the
                        argument for a detached and serious examination of the impulse behind a process of
                        social transformation that is, in critical respects, unique in our world.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="981841329" class="brl-location"></a>No uncertainty surrounds the nature of the generating impulse. Bahá’u’lláh’s writings
                        cover an enormous range of subjects from social issues such as racial integration,
                        the equality of the sexes, and disarmament, to those questions that affect the innermost
                        life of the human soul. The original texts, many of them in His own hand, the others
                        dictated and affirmed by their author, have been meticulously preserved. For several
                        decades, a systematic program of translation and publication has made selections from
                        Bahá’u’lláh’s writings accessible to people everywhere, in over eight hundred languages.

                        <a id="195700331" class="brl-location"></a>Bahá’u’lláh’s mission began in a subterranean dungeon in Teheran in August 1852. Born
                        into a noble family that could trace its ancestry back to the great dynasties of Persia’s
                        imperial past, He declined the ministerial career open to Him in government, and chose
                        instead to devote His energies to a range of philanthropies which had, by the early
                        1840s, earned Him widespread renown as “Father of the Poor.” This privileged existence
                        swiftly eroded after 1844, when Bahá’u’lláh became one of the leading advocates of
                        a movement that was to change the course of His country’s history.
                     </p>

                        <a id="825298441" class="brl-location"></a>The early nineteenth century was a period of messianic expectations in many lands.
                        Deeply disturbed by the implications of scientific inquiry and industrialization,
                        earnest believers from many religious backgrounds turned to the scriptures of their
                        faiths for an understanding of the accelerating processes of change. In Europe and
                        America groups like the Templers and the Millerites believed they had found in the
                        Christian scriptures evidence supporting their conviction that history had ended and
                        the return of Jesus Christ was at hand. A markedly similar ferment developed in the
                        Middle East around the belief that the fulfillment of various prophecies in the Qur’án
                        and Islamic Traditions was imminent.

                        <a id="841721566" class="brl-location"></a>By far the most dramatic of these millennialist movements had been the one in Persia,
                        which had focused on the person and teachings of a young merchant from the city of
                        Shiraz, known to history as the Báb.<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#846425835">4</a></sup> For nine years, from 1844 to 1853, Persians of all classes had been caught up in
                        a storm of hope and excitement aroused by the Báb’s announcement that the Day of God
                        was at hand and that He was himself the One promised in Islamic scripture. Humanity
                        stood, He said, on the threshold of an era that would witness the restructuring of
                        all aspects of life. New fields of learning, as yet inconceivable, would permit even
                        the children of the new age to surpass the most erudite of nineteenth-century scholars.
                        The human race was called by God to embrace these changes through undertaking a transformation
                        of its moral and spiritual life. His own mission was to prepare humanity for the event
                        that lay at the heart of these developments, the coming of that universal Messenger
                        of God, “He Whom God will make manifest,” awaited by the followers of all religions.<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#749670741">5</a></sup>

                        <a id="667193216" class="brl-location"></a>The claim had evoked violent hostility from the Muslim clergy, who taught that the
                        process of Divine Revelation had ended with Muḥammad; and that any assertion to the
                        contrary represented apostasy, punishable by death. Their denunciation of the Báb
                        had soon enlisted the support of the Persian authorities. Thousands of followers of
                        the new faith had perished in a horrific series of massacres throughout the country,
                        and the Báb had been publicly executed on July 9, 1850.<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#288202674">6</a></sup> In an age of growing Western involvement in the Orient, these events had aroused
                        interest and compassion in influential European circles. The nobility of the Báb’s
                        life and teachings, the heroism of His followers, and the hope for fundamental reform
                        that they had kindled in a darkened land had exerted a powerful attraction for personalities
                        ranging from Ernest Renan and Leo Tolstoy to Sarah Bernhardt and the Comte de Gobineau.<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#395602470">7</a></sup>

                        <a id="708575849" class="brl-location"></a>Because of His prominence in the defense of the Báb’s cause, Bahá’u’lláh was arrested
                        and brought, in chains and on foot, to Teheran. Protected in some measure by an impressive
                        personal reputation and the social position of His family, as well as by protests
                        which the Bábí pogroms had evoked from Western embassies, He was not sentenced to
                        death, as influential figures at the royal court were urging. Instead, He was cast
                        into the notorious Síyáh-<u>Ch</u>ál, the “Black Pit,” a deep, vermin-infested dungeon which had been created in one
                        of the city’s abandoned reservoirs. No charges were laid but He and some thirty companions
                        were, without appeal, kept immured in the darkness and filth of this pit, surrounded
                        by hardened criminals, many of them under sentence of death. Around Bahá’u’lláh’s
                        neck was clamped a heavy chain, so notorious in penal circles as to have been given
                        its own name. When He did not quickly perish, as had been expected, an attempt was
                        made to poison Him. The marks of the chain were to remain on His body for the rest
                        of His life.

                        <a id="066568096" class="brl-location"></a>Central to Bahá’u’lláh’s writings is an exposition of the great themes which have
                        preoccupied religious thinkers throughout the ages: God, the role of Revelation in
                        history, the relationship of the world’s religious systems to one another, the meaning
                        of faith, and the basis of moral authority in the organization of human society. Passages
                        in these texts speak intimately of His own spiritual experience, of His response to
                        the Divine summons, and of the dialogue with the “Spirit of God” which lay at the
                        heart of His mission. Religious history has never before offered the inquirer the
                        opportunity for so candid an encounter with the phenomenon of Divine Revelation.

                        Teheran, Western observers were appalled by scenes of Bábí victims blown from cannon

                        and immediately banished from His native land, His wealth and properties arbitrarily
                        confiscated. The Russian diplomatic representative, who knew Him personally and who
                        had followed the Bábí persecutions with growing distress, offered Him his protection
                        and refuge in lands under the control of his government. In the prevailing political

                        others as having political implications.<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#394608268">12</a></sup> Perhaps for this reason, Bahá’u’lláh chose to accept banishment to the neighboring
                        territory of Iraq, then under the rule of the Ottoman Empire. This expulsion was the
                        beginning of forty years of exile, imprisonment, and bitter persecution.

                        <a id="447935386" class="brl-location"></a>In the years which immediately followed His departure from Persia, Bahá’u’lláh gave
                        priority to the needs of the Bábí community which had gathered in Baghdad, a task
                        which had devolved on Him as the only effective Bábí leader to have survived the massacres.
                        The death of the Báb and the almost simultaneous loss of most of the young faith’s
                        teachers and guides had left the body of the believers scattered and demoralized.
                        When His efforts to rally those who had fled to Iraq aroused jealousy and dissension,<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#458257626">13</a></sup> He followed the path that had been taken by all of the Messengers of God gone before
                        Him, and withdrew to the wilderness, choosing for the purpose the mountain region
                        of Kurdistan. His withdrawal, as He later said, had “contemplated no return.” Its
                        reason “was to avoid becoming a subject of discord among the faithful, a source of
                        disturbance unto Our companions.” Although the two years spent in Kurdistan were a
                        period of intense privation and physical hardship, Bahá’u’lláh describes them as a
                        time of profound happiness during which He reflected deeply on the message entrusted
                        to Him: “<span>Alone, We communed with Our spirit, oblivious of the world and all that is therein.</span>”<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#679227893">14</a></sup>

                        did He eventually accede to urgent messages from the remnant of the desperate group
                        of exiles in Baghdad who had discovered His whereabouts and appealed to Him to return
                        and assume the leadership of their community.

                        a small book which He named “The Hidden Words.” Written in the form of a compilation
                        of moral aphorisms, the volume represents the ethical heart of Bahá’u’lláh’s message.
                        In verses which Bahá’u’lláh describes as a distillation of the spiritual guidance

                        <em>Book of Certitude</em>, a comprehensive exposition of the nature and purpose of religion. In passages that
                        draw not only on the Qur’án, but with equal facility and insight on the Old and New
                        Testaments, the Messengers of God are depicted as agents of a single, unbroken process,
                        the awakening of the human race to its spiritual and moral potentialities. A humanity
                        which has come of age can respond to a directness of teaching that goes beyond the
                        language of parable and allegory; faith is a matter not of blind belief, but of conscious
                        knowledge. Nor is the guidance of an ecclesiastical elite any longer required: the
                        gift of reason confers on each individual in this new age of enlightenment and education
                        the capacity to respond to Divine guidance. The test is that of sincerity:

                        the <em>Book of Certitude</em> is organized around a vigorous exposition of the mission of the martyred Báb. Not
                        the least of the reasons for the book’s powerful influence on the Bábí community,
                        which included a number of scholars and former seminarians, was the mastery of Islamic
                        thought and teaching its author displays in demonstrating the Báb’s claim to have
                        fulfilled the prophecies of Islam. Calling on the Bábís to be worthy of the trust
                        which the Báb had placed in them and of the sacrifice of so many heroic lives, Bahá’u’lláh
                        held out before them the challenge not only of bringing their personal lives into
                        conformity with the Divine teachings, but of making their community a model for the
                        heterogeneous population of Baghdad, the Iraqi provincial capital.

                           upon his feet were his own, and each one who entered the presence of Bahá’u’lláh could

                        <a id="550769151" class="brl-location"></a>To the dismay of the Persian consular authorities who had believed the Bábí “episode”
                        to have run its course, the community of exiles gradually became a respected and influential
                        element in Iraq’s provincial capital and the neighboring towns. Since several of the
                        most important shrines of Shi‘ih Islam were located in the area, a steady stream of
                        Persian pilgrims was also exposed, under the most favorable circumstances, to the
                        renewal of Bábí influence. Among dignitaries who called on Bahá’u’lláh in the simple
                        house He occupied were princes of the royal family. So enchanted by the experience
                        was one of them that he conceived the somewhat naive idea that by erecting a duplicate
                        of the building in the gardens of his own estate, he might recapture something of
                        the atmosphere of spiritual purity and detachment he had briefly encountered. Another,
                        more deeply moved by the experience of his visit, expressed to friends the feeling
                        that “were all the sorrows of the world to be crowded into my heart they would, I
                        feel, all vanish, when in the presence of Bahá’u’lláh. It is as if I had entered Paradise.…”<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#305621817">18</a></sup>

                        <a id="660163091" class="brl-location"></a>By 1863, Bahá’u’lláh concluded that the time had come to begin acquainting some of
                        those around Him with the mission which had been entrusted to Him in the darkness
                        of the Síyáh-<u>Ch</u>ál. This decision coincided with a new stage in the campaign of opposition to His
                        work, which had been relentlessly pursued by the Shi‘ih Muslim clergy and representatives
                        of the Persian government. Fearing that the acclaim which Bahá’u’lláh was beginning
                        to enjoy among influential Persian visitors to Iraq would reignite popular enthusiasm
                        in Persia, the Shah’s government pressed the Ottoman authorities to remove Him far
                        from the borders and into the interior of the empire. Eventually, the Turkish government
                        acceded to these pressures and invited the exile, as its guest, to make His residence
                        in the capital, Constantinople. Despite the courteous terms in which the message was
                        couched, the intention was clearly to require compliance.<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#305621818">19</a></sup>

                        <a id="676699257" class="brl-location"></a>By this time, the devotion of the little company of exiles had come to focus on Bahá’u’lláh’s
                        person as well as on His exposition of the Báb’s teachings. A growing number of them
                        had become convinced that He was speaking not only as the Báb’s advocate, but on behalf
                        of the far greater cause which the latter had declared to be imminent. These beliefs
                        became a certainty in late April 1863 when Bahá’u’lláh, on the eve of His departure
                        for Constantinople, called together individuals among His companions, in a garden
                        to which was later given the name Riḍván (“Paradise”), and confided the central fact
                        of His mission. Over the next four years, although no open announcement was considered
                        timely, the hearers gradually shared with trusted friends the news that the Báb’s
                        promises had been fulfilled and that the “Day of God” had dawned.

                        to set an example of obedience to civil authority: “In every country where any of
                        this people reside, they must behave towards the government of that country with loyalty,

                        demonstration of the potency of these principles. In only a few years, a band of foreign
                        exiles whose arrival in the area had aroused suspicion and aversion on the part of
                        their neighbors had become one of the most respected and influential segments of the
                        population. They supported themselves through flourishing businesses; as a group they
                        were admired for their generosity and the integrity of their conduct; the lurid allegations
                        of religious fanaticism and violence, sedulously spread by Persian consular officials
                        and members of the Shi‘ih Muslim clergy, had ceased to have an effect on the public
                        mind. By May 3, 1863, when He rode out of Baghdad, accompanied by His family and those
                        of His companions and servants who had been chosen to accompany Him to Constantinople,
                        Bahá’u’lláh had become an immensely popular and cherished figure. In the days immediately
                        preceding the leave-taking a stream of notables, including the Governor of the province
                        himself, came to the garden where He had temporarily taken up residence, many of them
                        from great distances, in order to pay their respects. Eyewitnesses to the departure
                        have described in moving terms the acclaim that greeted Him, the tears of many of
                        the onlookers, and the concern of the Ottoman authorities and civil officials to do
                        their visitor honor.<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#449595382">28</a></sup>

                           the lamp will never be ignited, and unless the dross is blotted out from the face
                           of the mirror it can never represent the image of the sun nor reflect its light and

                        <a id="335698570" class="brl-location"></a>The time has come, Bahá’u’lláh said, when humanity has both the capacity and the opportunity
                        to see the entire panorama of its spiritual development as a single process: “Peerless
                        is this Day, for it is as the eye to past ages and centuries, and as a light unto
                        the darkness of the times.”<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#053134524">37</a></sup> In this perspective, the followers of differing religious traditions must strive
                        to understand what He called “the changeless Faith of God”<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#864555819">38</a></sup> and to distinguish its central spiritual impulse from the changing laws and concepts
                        that were revealed to meet the requirements of an ever-evolving human society:

                        discovery. Reason, Bahá’u’lláh asserts, is God’s greatest gift to the soul, “a sign

                        <a id="359730430" class="brl-location"></a>What is common to all who are devoted to one or another of the world’s religious systems
                        is the conviction that it is through the Divine Revelation that the soul comes in
                        touch with the world of God, and that it is this relationship which gives real meaning
                        to life. Some of the most important passages in Bahá’u’lláh’s writings are those which
                        discuss at length the nature and role of those who are the channels of this Revelation,
                        the Messengers or “Manifestations of God.” A recurrent analogy found in these passages
                        is that of the physical sun. While the latter shares certain characteristics of the
                        other bodies in the solar system, it differs from them in that it is, in itself, the
                        source of the system’s light. The planets and moons reflect light whereas the sun
                        emits it as an attribute inseparable from its nature. The system revolves around this
                        focal point, each of its members influenced not only by its particular composition,
                        but by its relationship to the source of the system’s light.<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#138649584">42</a></sup>

                        <a id="566877494" class="brl-location"></a>In the same way, Bahá’u’lláh asserts, the human personality which the Manifestation
                        of God shares with the rest of the race is differentiated from others in a way that
                        fits it to serve as the channel or vehicle for the Revelation of God. Apparently contradictory
                        references to this dual station, attributed, for example, to Christ,<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#644042477">43</a></sup> have been among the many sources of religious confusion and dissension throughout
                        history. Bahá’u’lláh says on the subject:

                        <a id="471906466" class="brl-location"></a>Throughout history, the conviction of believers that the Founder of their own religion
                        occupied a unique station has had the effect of stimulating intense speculation on
                        the nature of the Manifestation of God. Such speculation has, however, been severely
                        hampered by the difficulties of interpreting and resolving the allegorical allusions
                        in past scriptures. The attempt to crystallize opinion in the form of religious dogma
                        has been a divisive rather than unifying force in history. Indeed, despite the enormous
                        energy devoted to theological pursuits—or perhaps because of it—there are today profound
                        differences among Muslims as to the precise station of Muḥammad, among Christians
                        as to that of Jesus, and among Buddhists with respect to the Founder of their own
                        religion. As is all too apparent, the controversies created by these and other differences
                        within any one given tradition have proven at least as acute as those separating that
                        tradition from its sister faiths.

                        feature of Bahá’u’lláh’s exposition of the function of the Manifestation of God. Divine
                        Revelation is, He says, the motive power of civilization. When it occurs, its transforming
                        effect on the minds and souls of those who respond to it is replicated in the new
                        society that slowly takes shape around their experience. A new center of loyalty emerges
                        that can win the commitment of peoples from the widest range of cultures; music and
                        the arts seize on symbols that mediate far richer and more mature inspirations; a
                        radical redefinition of concepts of right and wrong makes possible the formulation
                        of new codes of civil law and conduct; new institutions are conceived in order to
                        give expression to impulses of moral responsibility previously ignored or unknown:
                        “He was in the world, and the world was made by him.…”<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#872858468">47</a></sup> As the new culture evolves into a civilization, it assimilates achievements and insights
                        of past eras in a multitude of fresh permutations. Features of past cultures that
                        cannot be incorporated atrophy or are taken up by marginal elements among the population.
                        The Word of God creates new possibilities within both the individual consciousness
                        and human relationships.

                        of disintegration sets in, as it does throughout the phenomenal world. Turning again
                        to analogies offered by nature, Bahá’u’lláh compares this hiatus in the development
                        of civilization to the onset of winter. Moral vitality diminishes, as does social
                        cohesion. Challenges which would have been overcome at an earlier age, or been turned
                        into opportunities for exploration and achievement, become insuperable barriers. Religion
                        loses its relevance, and experimentation becomes increasingly fragmented, further
                        deepening social divisions. Increasingly, uncertainty about the meaning and value
                        of life generates anxiety and confusion. Speaking about this condition in our own
                        age Bahá’u’lláh says:

                        and social paradigm begins to take shape, people subsist spiritually and morally on
                        the last traces of earlier Divine endowments. The routine tasks of society may or
                        may not be done; laws may be obeyed or flouted; social and political experimentation
                        may flame up or fail; but the roots of faith—without which no society can indefinitely
                        endure—have been exhausted. At the “end of the age,” at the “end of the world,” the
                        spiritually minded begin to turn again to the Creative source. However clumsy or disturbing
                        the process may be, however inelegant or unfortunate some of the options considered,
                        such searching is an instinctive response to the awareness that an immense chasm has

                        point. Though not understood, these effects increasingly permeate human affairs, revealing
                        the contradictions in popular assumptions and in society, and intensifying the search

                        <a id="249600092" class="brl-location"></a>Within the context of the history of civilization, the objective of the succession
                        of divine Manifestations has been to prepare human consciousness for the race’s unification
                        as a single species, indeed as a single organism capable of taking up the responsibility
                        for its collective future: “<span class="brl-italic">He Who is your Lord, the All-Merciful,</span>” Bahá’u’lláh says, “<span class="brl-italic">cherisheth in His heart the desire of beholding the entire human race as one soul
                           and one body.</span>”<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#841086034">56</a></sup> Not until humanity has accepted its organic oneness can it meet even its immediate
                        challenges, let alone those that lie ahead: “<span class="brl-italic">The well-being of mankind,</span>” Bahá’u’lláh insists, “<span class="brl-italic">its peace and security, are unattainable unless and until its unity is firmly established.</span>”<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#727808370">57</a></sup> Only a unified global society can provide its children with the sense of inner assurance
                        implied in one of Bahá’u’lláh’s prayers to God: “<span class="brl-italic">Whatever duty Thou hast prescribed unto Thy servants of extolling to the utmost Thy
                           majesty and glory is but a token of Thy grace unto them, that they may be enabled
                           to ascend unto the station conferred upon their own inmost being, the station of the
                           knowledge of their own selves.</span>”<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#906179232">58</a></sup> Paradoxically, it is only by achieving true unity that humanity can fully cultivate
                        its diversity and individuality. This is the goal which the missions of all of the
                        Manifestations of God known to history have served, the Day of “one fold and one shepherd.”<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#301341586">59</a></sup> Its attainment, Bahá’u’lláh says, is the stage of civilization upon which the human
                        race is now entering.

                        <a id="223359976" class="brl-location"></a>One of the most suggestive analogies to be found in the writings not only of Bahá’u’lláh,
                        but of the Báb before Him, is the comparison between the evolution of the human race
                        and the life of the individual human being. Humanity has moved through stages in its
                        collective development which are reminiscent of the periods of infancy, childhood,
                        and adolescence in the maturation of its individual members. We are now experiencing
                        the beginnings of our collective maturity, endowed with new capacities and opportunities
                        of which we as yet have only the dimmest awareness.<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#444176868">60</a></sup>
                        
                     </p>

                        <a id="194621478" class="brl-location"></a>Against this background, it is not difficult to understand the primacy given in Bahá’u’lláh’s
                        teachings to the principle of unity. The oneness of humanity is the leitmotif of the
                        age now opening, the standard against which must be tested all proposals for the betterment
                        of humanity. There is, Bahá’u’lláh insists, but one human race; inherited notions
                        that a particular racial or ethnic group is in some way superior to the rest of humanity
                        are without foundation. Similarly, since all of the Messengers of God have served
                        as agents of the one Divine Will, their revelations are the collective legacy of the
                        entire human race; each person on earth is a legitimate heir of the whole of that
                        spiritual tradition. Persistence in prejudices of any kind is both damaging to the
                        interests of society and a violation of the Will of God for our age:

                        organization. Beginning from the family unit and its various extensions, the human
                        race has developed, with varying degrees of success, societies based on the clan,
                        the tribe, the city-state, and most recently the nation. This progressively broader
                        and more complex social milieu provides human potential with both stimulation and
                        scope for development, and this development, in turn, has induced ever-new modifications
                        of the social fabric. Humanity’s coming-of-age, therefore, must entail a total transformation
                        of the social order. The new society must be one capable of embracing the entire diversity

                        its affairs as to give full expression to this fact. The earth’s resources are the
                        property of all humanity, not of any one people. Different contributions to the common
                        economic welfare deserve and should receive different measures of reward and recognition,
                        but the extremes of wealth and poverty which afflict most nations on earth, regardless

                        <a id="308244769" class="brl-location"></a>The writings which have been quoted in the foregoing were revealed, for the most part,
                        in conditions of renewed persecution. Soon after the exiles’ arrival in Constantinople,
                        it became apparent that the honors showered upon Bahá’u’lláh during His journey from
                        Baghdad had represented only a brief interlude. The Ottoman authorities’ decision
                        to move the “Bábí” leader and His companions to the capital of the empire rather than
                        to some remote province deepened the alarm among the representatives of the Persian
                        government.<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#761958644">68</a></sup> Fearing that the developments in Baghdad would be repeated, and might attract this
                        time not only the sympathy but perhaps even the allegiance of influential figures
                        in the Turkish government, the Persian ambassador pressed insistently for the dispatch
                        of the exiles to some more distant part of the empire. His argument was that the spread
                        of a new religious message in the capital could produce political as well as religious
                        repercussions.

                        <a id="952078083" class="brl-location"></a>Initially, the Ottoman government strongly resisted. The chief minister, ‘Alí Pá<u>sh</u>á, had indicated to Western diplomats his belief that Bahá’u’lláh was “a man of great
                        distinction, exemplary conduct, great moderation, and a most dignified figure.” His
                        teachings were, in the minister’s opinion, “worthy of high esteem” because they counteracted
                        the religious animosities dividing the Jewish, Christian, and Muslim subjects of the
                        empire.<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#442802022">69</a></sup>

                        <a id="272564890" class="brl-location"></a>Gradually, however, a degree of resentment and suspicion developed. In the Ottoman
                        capital, political and economic power was in the hands of court functionaries who,
                        with but few exceptions, were persons of little or no competence. Venality was the
                        oil on which the machinery of government operated, and the capital was a magnet for
                        a horde of people who flocked there from every part of the empire and beyond, seeking
                        favors and influence. It was expected that any prominent figure from another country
                        or from one of the tribute territories would, immediately upon arrival in Constantinople,
                        join the throngs of patronage-seekers in the reception rooms of the pashas and ministers
                        of the imperial court. No element had a worse reputation than the competing groups
                        of Persian political exiles who were known for both their sophistication and their
                        lack of scruple.

                        <a id="044901918" class="brl-location"></a>To the distress of friends who urged Him to make use of the prevailing hostility toward
                        the Persian government and of the sympathy which His own sufferings had aroused, Bahá’u’lláh
                        made it clear that He had no requests to make. Although several government ministers
                        made social calls at the residence assigned to Him, he did not take advantage of these
                        openings. He was in Constantinople, He said, as the guest of the Sultan, at his invitation,
                        and His interest lay in spiritual and moral concerns.

                        <a id="914278188" class="brl-location"></a>Many years later, the Persian ambassador, Mírzá Ḥusayn <u>Kh</u>án, reflecting on his tour of duty in the Ottoman capital, and complaining about the
                        damage which the greed and untrustworthiness of his countrymen had done to Persia’s
                        reputation in Constantinople, paid a surprisingly candid tribute to the example which
                        Bahá’u’lláh’s conduct had been able briefly to set.<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#198811172">70</a></sup> At the time, however, he and his colleagues made use of the situation to represent
                        it as an astute way on the exile’s part of concealing secret conspiracies against
                        public security and the religion of the State. Under pressure of these influences,
                        the Ottoman authorities finally took the decision to transfer Bahá’u’lláh and His
                        family to the provincial city of Adrianople. The move was made hastily, in the depth
                        of an extremely severe winter. Housed there in inadequate buildings, lacking suitable
                        clothing and other provisions, the exiles endured a year of great suffering. It was
                        clear that, though charged with no crime and given no opportunity to defend themselves,
                        they had arbitrarily been made state prisoners.

                        <a id="521439123" class="brl-location"></a>From the point of view of religious history, the successive banishments of Bahá’u’lláh
                        to Constantinople and Adrianople have a striking symbolism. For the first time, a
                        Manifestation of God, Founder of an independent religious system which was soon to
                        spread throughout the planet, had crossed the narrow neck of water separating Asia
                        from Europe, and had set foot in “the West.” All of the other great religions had
                        arisen in Asia and the ministries of their Founders had been confined to that continent.
                        Referring to the fact that the dispensations of the past, and particularly those of
                        Abraham, Christ, and Muḥammad, had produced their most important effects on the development
                        of civilization during the course of their westward expansion, Bahá’u’lláh predicted
                        that the same thing would occur in this new age, but on a vastly larger scale: “In
                        the East the Light of His Revelation hath broken; in the West have appeared the signs
                        of His dominion. Ponder this in your hearts, O people…”<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#203275536">71</a></sup>
                        
                     </p>

                        <a id="939584474" class="brl-location"></a>It is then perhaps not surprising that Bahá’u’lláh chose this moment to make public
                        the mission which had been slowly enlisting the allegiance of the followers of the
                        Báb throughout the Middle East. His announcement took the form of a series of statements
                        which are among the most remarkable documents in religious history. In them, the Manifestation
                        of God addresses the “Kings and Rulers of the world,” announcing to them the dawning
                        of the Day of God, alluding to the as yet inconceivable changes which were gathering
                        momentum throughout the world, and calling on them as the trustees of God and of their
                        fellow human beings to arise and serve the process of the unification of the human
                        race. Because of the veneration in which they were held by the mass of their subjects,
                        and because of the absolute nature of the rule which most of them exercised, it lay
                        in their power, He said, to assist in bringing about what He called the “Most Great
                        Peace,” a world order characterized by unity and animated by Divine justice.

                        <a id="480597771" class="brl-location"></a>Only with the greatest difficulty can the modern reader envision the moral and intellectual
                        world in which these monarchs of a century ago lived. From their biographies and private
                        correspondence, it is apparent that, with few exceptions, they were personally devout,
                        taking a leading part in the spiritual life of their respective nations, often as
                        the heads of the state religions, and convinced of the unerring truths of the Bible
                        or the Qur’án. The power which most of them wielded they attributed directly to the
                        divine authority of passages in these same Scriptures, an authority about which they
                        were vigorously articulate. They were the anointed of God. Prophecies of “the Latter
                        Days” and “the Kingdom of God” were not for them myth or allegory, but certainties
                        upon which all moral order rested and in which they would themselves be called on
                        by God to give an account of their stewardship.

                        century. Nationalistic aggrandizement and imperial expansion recruited not only kings
                        but parliamentarians, academics, artists, newspapers, and the major religious establishments
                        as eager propagandists of Western triumphalism. Proposals for social change, however
                        disinterested and idealistic, quickly fell captive to a swarm of new ideologies thrown
                        up by the rising tide of dogmatic materialism. In the Orient, mesmerized by its own
                        claims to represent all that humanity ever could or would know of God and truth, the
                        Islamic world sank steadily deeper into ignorance, lethargy, and a sullen hostility
                        to a human race which failed to acknowledge this spiritual preeminence.

                        did not anticipate what would result from the establishment of Bahá’u’lláh in another
                        major provincial capital. Within a year of His arrival in Adrianople, their prisoner

                        Persian consular representatives, two of the most devoted of these admirers were <u>Kh</u>ur<u>sh</u>íd Pá<u>sh</u>á, the Governor of the province, and the <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u>u’l-Islám, the leading Sunni religious dignitary. In the eyes of His hosts and the
                        public generally, the exile was a moral philosopher and saint the validity of whose
                        teachings was reflected not only in the example of His own life but in the changes
                        they effected among the flood of Persian pilgrims who flocked to this remote center
                        of the Ottoman Empire in order to visit Him.<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#882938112">75</a></sup>

                        <a id="299360351" class="brl-location"></a>These unanticipated developments convinced the Persian ambassador and his colleagues
                        that it was only a matter of time before the Bahá’í movement, which was continuing
                        to spread in Persia, would have established itself as a major influence in Persia’s
                        neighboring and rival empire. Throughout this period of its history, the ramshackle
                        Ottoman Empire was struggling against repeated incursions by Tsarist Russia, uprisings
                        among its subject peoples, and persistent attempts by the ostensibly sympathetic British
                        and Austrian governments to detach various Turkish territories and incorporate them
                        into their own empires. These unstable political conditions in Turkey’s European provinces
                        offered new and urgent arguments supporting the ambassador’s appeal that the exiles
                        be sent to a distant colony where Bahá’u’lláh would have no further contact with influential
                        circles, whether Turkish or Western.

                        Bahá’u’lláh had come to enjoy throughout the region appeared to lend credibility to
                        the Persian embassy’s suggestions. In this climate of opinion, the government abruptly
                        decided to subject its guest to strict confinement. Without warning, early one day,
                        Bahá’u’lláh’s house was surrounded by soldiers, and the exiles were ordered to prepare
                        for departure to an unknown destination.

                        <a id="913320841" class="brl-location"></a>The place chosen for this final banishment was the grim fortress-town of ‘Akká (Acre)
                        on the coast of the Holy Land. Notorious throughout the empire for the foulness of
                        its climate and the prevalence of many diseases, ‘Akká was a penal colony used by
                        the Ottoman State for the incarceration of dangerous criminals who could be expected
                        not to survive too long their imprisonment there. Arriving in August 1868, Bahá’u’lláh,
                        the members of His family, and a company of His followers who had been exiled with
                        Him were to experience two years of suffering and abuse within the fortress itself,
                        and then be confined under house arrest to a nearby building owned by a local merchant.
                        For a long time the exiles were shunned by the superstitious local populace who had
                        been warned in public sermons against “the God of the Persians,” who was depicted
                        as an enemy of public order and the purveyor of blasphemous and immoral ideas. Several
                        members of the small group of exiles died of the privations and other conditions to
                        which they were subjected.<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#811122887">76</a></sup>

                        <a id="263562946" class="brl-location"></a>It seems, in retrospect, the keenest irony that the selection of the Holy Land as
                        the place of Bahá’u’lláh’s forced confinement should have been the result of pressure
                        from ecclesiastical and civil enemies whose aim was to extinguish His religious influence.
                        Palestine, revered by three of the great monotheistic religions as the point where
                        the worlds of God and of man intersect, held then, as it had for thousands of years,
                        a unique place in human expectation. Only a few weeks before Bahá’u’lláh’s arrival,
                        the main leadership of the German Protestant Templer movement sailed from Europe to
                        establish at the foot of Mount Carmel a colony that would welcome Christ, whose advent
                        they believed to be imminent. Over the lintels of several of the small houses they
                        erected, facing across the bay to Bahá’u’lláh’s prison at ‘Akká, can still be seen
                        such carved inscriptions as “Der Herr ist nahe” (“The Lord is near”).<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#116028918">77</a></sup>

                        <a id="505730517" class="brl-location"></a>In ‘Akká, Bahá’u’lláh continued the dictation of a series of letters to individual
                        rulers, which He had begun in Adrianople. Several contained warnings of the judgment
                        of God on their negligence and misrule, warnings whose dramatic fulfillment aroused
                        intense public discussion throughout the Near East. Less than two months after the
                        exiles arrived in the prison-city, for example, Fu’ád Pá<u>sh</u>á, the Ottoman foreign minister, whose misrepresentations had helped precipitate the
                        banishment, was abruptly dismissed from his post and died in France of a heart attack.
                        The event was marked by a statement which predicted the early dismissal of his colleague,
                        Prime Minister ‘Álí Pá<u>sh</u>á, the overthrow and death of the Sultan, and the loss of Turkish territories in Europe,

                        War, had been warned by Bahá’u’lláh in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas to heed the example of the

                        history, organized religion has erected between humanity and the Revelations of God.
                        Dogmas, inspired by popular superstition and perfected by misspent intelligence, have
                        repeatedly been imposed on a Divine process whose purpose has at all times been spiritual
                        and moral. Laws of social interaction, revealed for the purpose of consolidating community
                        life, have been made the basis for structures of arcane doctrine and practice which
                        have burdened the masses whose benefit they were supposed to serve. Even the exercise
                        of intellect, the chief tool possessed by the human race, has been deliberately hampered,
                        producing an eventual breakdown in the dialogue between faith and science upon which

                        has fallen. Worse, organized religion has become itself a most virulent cause of hatred
                        and warfare among the peoples of the world. “Religious fanaticism and hatred,” Bahá’u’lláh
                        warned over a century ago, “are a world-devouring fire, whose violence none can quench.
                        The Hand of Divine power can, alone, deliver mankind from this desolating affliction.”<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#134457796">85</a></sup>

                        to make the Word of God a private preserve, and its exposition a means for personal

                        of civilization has struggled. In the pursuit of their ends, many of them have not

                        <a id="513441044" class="brl-location"></a>In June 1877, Bahá’u’lláh at last emerged from the strict confinement of the prison-city
                        of ‘Akká, and moved with His family to “Mazra‘ih,” a small estate a few miles north
                        of the city.<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#699582515">106</a></sup> As had been predicted in His statement to the Turkish government, Sulṭán ‘Abdu’l-‘Azíz
                        had been overthrown and assassinated in a palace coup, and gusts from the winds of
                        political change sweeping the world were beginning to invade even the shuttered precincts
                        of the Ottoman imperial system. After a brief two-year stay at Mazra‘ih, Bahá’u’lláh
                        moved to “Bahjí,” a large mansion surrounded by gardens, which His son ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
                        had rented for Him and the members of His extended family.<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#241490951">107</a></sup> The remaining twelve years of His life were devoted to His writings on a wide range
                        of spiritual and social issues, and to receiving a stream of Bahá’í pilgrims who made
                        their way, with great difficulty, from Persia and other lands.

                        <a id="573413686" class="brl-location"></a>Throughout the Near and Middle East the nucleus of a community life was beginning
                        to take shape among those who had accepted His message. For its guidance, Bahá’u’lláh
                        had revealed a system of laws and institutions designed to give practical effect to
                        the principles in His writings.<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#877278327">108</a></sup> Authority was vested in councils democratically elected by the whole community, provisions
                        were made to exclude the possibility of a clerical elite arising, and principles of
                        consultation and group decision making were established.

                        <a id="347078911" class="brl-location"></a>At the heart of this system was what Bahá’u’lláh termed a “new Covenant” between God
                        and humankind. The distinguishing feature of humanity’s coming of age is that, for
                        the first time in its history, the entire human race is consciously involved, however
                        dimly, in the awareness of its own oneness and of the earth as a single homeland.
                        This awakening opens the way to a new relationship between God and humankind. As the
                        peoples of the world embrace the spiritual authority inherent in the guidance of the
                        Revelation of God for this age, Bahá’u’lláh said, they will find in themselves a moral
                        empowerment which human effort alone has proven incapable of generating. “A new race
                        of men”<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#721368466">109</a></sup> will emerge as the result of this relationship, and the work of building a global
                        civilization will begin. The mission of the Bahá’í community was to demonstrate the
                        efficacy of this Covenant in healing the ills that divide the human race.

                        <a id="122292909" class="brl-location"></a>Bahá’u’lláh died at Bahjí on May 29, 1892, in His 75th year. At the time of His passing,
                        the cause entrusted to Him forty years earlier in the darkness of Teheran’s Black
                        Pit was poised to break free of the Islamic lands where it had taken shape, and to
                        establish itself first across America and Europe and then throughout the world. In
                        doing so, it would itself become a vindication of the promise of the new Covenant
                        between God and humankind. For alone of all the world’s independent religions, the
                        Bahá’í Faith and its community of believers were to pass successfully through the
                        critical first century of their existence with their unity firmly intact, undamaged
                        by the age-old blight of schism and faction. Their experience offers compelling evidence
                        for Bahá’u’lláh’s assurance that the human race, in all its diversity, can learn to
                        live and work as one people, in a common global homeland.

                        <a id="944474588" class="brl-location"></a>Just two years before His death, Bahá’u’lláh received at Bahjí one of the few Westerners
                        to meet Him, and the only one to leave a written account of the experience. The visitor
                        was Edward Granville Browne, a rising young orientalist from Cambridge University,
                        whose attention had originally been attracted by the dramatic history of the Báb and
                        His heroic band of followers. Of his meeting with Bahá’u’lláh, Browne wrote:

                           and awe, I became definitely conscious that the room was not untenanted. In the corner
                           where the divan met the wall sat a wondrous and venerable figure.… The face of him
                           on whom I gazed I can never forget, though I cannot describe it. Those piercing eyes
                           seemed to read one’s very soul; power and authority sat on that ample brow.… No need

                           a devotion and love which kings might envy and emperors sigh for in vain!

                                       of His mission, 1844). On several occasions the Báb also indicated to certain of His

                                       by enthusiastic bands of followers, many of them young seminarians. The Muslim clergy
                                       had replied by inciting mob violence. Unfortunately, these events coincided with a
                                       political crisis created by the death of Muḥammad <u>Sh</u>áh and a struggle over the succession. It was the leaders of the successful political
                                       faction, behind the boy-king Náṣiri’d-Dín <u>Sh</u>áh, who then turned the royal army against the Bábí enthusiasts. The latter, raised
                                       in a Muslim frame of reference, and believing that they had a moral right to self-defense,
                                       barricaded themselves in makeshift shelters and withstood long, bloody sieges. When
                                       they had eventually been overcome and slaughtered, and the Báb had been executed,
                                       two deranged Bábí youth stopped the Shah in a public road and fired birdshot at him,
                                       in an ill-conceived attempt at assassination. It was this incident which provided
                                       the excuse for the worst of the massacres of Bábís which evoked protests from Western
                                       embassies. For an account of the period see W. Hatcher and D. Martin, <em>The Bahá’í Faith: The Emerging Global Religion</em> (San Francisco: Harper and Row, 1985), pp. 6–32.<span class="brl-returntotext"> <a href="#667193216">↩</a>

                                       While still a youth and under the guidance of Bahá’u’lláh Yaḥyá had been appointed
                                       by the Báb as nominal head of the Bábí community, pending the imminent advent of “Him
                                       Whom God will make manifest.” Falling under the influence of a former Muslim theologian,
                                       Siyyid Muḥammad Iṣfahání, however, Yaḥyá gradually became estranged from his brother.
                                       Rather than being expressed openly, this resentment found its outlet in clandestine
                                       agitation, which had a disastrous effect on the exiles’ already low morale. Yaḥyá
                                       eventually refused to accept Bahá’u’lláh’s declaration, and played no role in the
                                       development of the Bahá’í Faith which this declaration initiated.<span class="brl-returntotext"> <a href="#447935386">↩</a>

                                       especially sympathetic to Bahá’u’lláh, and resistant to pressure from the Persian
                                       government. The governor of Baghdad, Námiq Pá<u>sh</u>á, had written enthusiastically to the capital about both the character and influence
                                       of the distinguished Persian exile. Sulṭán ‘Abdu’l-‘Azíz found the reports intriguing
                                       because, although he was Caliph of Sunni Islam, he considered himself a mystical seeker.
                                       Equally important, in another way, was the reaction of his chief minister, ‘Álí Pá<u>sh</u>á. To the latter, who was an accomplished student of Persian language and literature
                                       as well as a would-be modernizer of the Turkish administration, Bahá’u’lláh seemed
                                       a highly sympathetic figure. It was no doubt this combination of sympathy and interest
                                       which led the Ottoman government to invite Bahá’u’lláh to the capital rather than
                                       send Him to a more remote center or deliver Him to the Persian authorities, as the
                                       latter were urging.<span class="brl-returntotext"> <a href="#308244769">↩</a>
