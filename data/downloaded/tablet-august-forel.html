                     <span class="brl-uppercase">O revered</span> personage, lover of truth! Thy letter dated 28 July 1921 hath been received. The
                     contents thereof were most pleasing and indicated that, praised be the Lord, thou
                     art as yet young, and searchest after truth, that thy power of thought is strong and
                     the discoveries of thy mind manifest.
                  </p>

                     <a id="918014968" class="brl-location"></a>Numerous copies of the epistle I had written to Dr. Fisher<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#988651550">1</a></sup> are spread far and wide and every one knoweth that it hath been revealed in the year
                     1910. Apart from this, numerous epistles have been written before the war upon the
                     same theme, and reference, too, hath been made to these questions in the Journal of
                     the San Francisco University, the date whereof is known beyond any doubt.<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#072071450">2</a></sup> In like manner have the philosophers of broad vision praised highly the discourse
                     eloquently delivered  in the above-named University.<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#069115941">3</a></sup> A copy of that paper is thus enclosed and forwarded. Thy works are no doubt of great
                     benefit, and if published, send us a copy of each.

                     <a id="742032986" class="brl-location"></a>By materialists, whose belief with regard to Divinity hath been explained, is not
                     meant philosophers in general, but rather that group of materialists of narrow vision
                     who worship that which is sensed, who depend upon the five senses only, and whose
                     criterion of knowledge is limited to that which can be perceived by the senses. All
                     that can be sensed is to them real, whilst whatever falleth not under the power of
                     the senses is either unreal or doubtful. The existence of the Deity they regard as
                     wholly doubtful.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <a id="629210362" class="brl-location"></a>It is as thou hast written, not philosophers in general but narrow-minded materialists
                     that are meant. As to deistic philosophers, such as Socrates, Plato and Aristotle,
                     they are indeed worthy of esteem and of the highest praise, for they have rendered
                     distinguished services to mankind. In like manner we regard the materialistic, accomplished,
                     moderate philosophers, who have been of service (to mankind). 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <a id="994962999" class="brl-location"></a>We regard knowledge and wisdom as the foundation of the progress of mankind, and extol
                     philosophers who are endowed with broad vision. Peruse carefully the San Francisco
                     University Journal that the truth may be revealed to thee.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <a id="638170569" class="brl-location"></a>Now concerning mental faculties, they are in truth of the inherent properties of the
                     soul, even as the radiation of light is the essential property of the sun. The rays
                     of the sun are renewed but the sun itself is ever the same and unchanged. Consider
                     how the human intellect develops and weakens, and may at times come to naught, whereas
                     the soul changeth not. For the mind to manifest itself, the human body must be whole;
                     and a sound mind cannot be but in a sound body, whereas the soul dependeth not upon
                     the body. It is through the power of the soul that the mind comprehendeth, imagineth
                     and exerteth its influence, whilst the soul is a power that is free. The mind comprehendeth
                     the abstract by the aid of the concrete, but the soul hath limitless manifestations
                     of its own. The mind is circumscribed, the soul limitless. It is by the aid of such
                     senses as those of sight, hearing, taste, smell and touch, that the mind comprehendeth,
                     whereas the soul is free from all agencies. The soul as thou observest, whether it
                     be in sleep or waking, is in motion and ever active. Possibly it may, whilst in a
                     dream, unravel an intricate problem, incapable of solution in the waking state. The
                     mind, moreover, understandeth not whilst the senses have ceased to function, and in
                     the embryonic stage and in early infancy the reasoning power is totally absent, whereas
                     the soul is ever endowed with full strength. In short, the proofs are many that go
                     to show that despite the loss of reason, the power of the soul would still continue
                     to exist. The spirit however possesseth various grades and stations.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <a id="723461091" class="brl-location"></a>As to the existence of spirit in the mineral: it is indubitable that minerals are
                     endowed with a spirit and life according to the requirements of that stage. This unknown
                     secret, too, hath become known unto the materialists who now maintain that all beings
                     are endowed with life, even as He saith in the Qur’án, ‘All things are living’.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <a id="898477974" class="brl-location"></a>In the vegetable world, too, there is the power of growth, and that power of growth
                     is the spirit. In the animal world there is the sense of feeling, but in the human
                     world there is an all-embracing power. In all the preceding stages the power of reason
                     is absent, but the soul existeth and revealeth itself. The sense of feeling understandeth
                     not the soul, whereas the reasoning power of the mind proveth the existence thereof.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <a id="446583665" class="brl-location"></a>In like manner the mind proveth the existence of an unseen Reality that embraceth
                     all beings, and that existeth and revealeth itself in all stages, the essence whereof
                     is beyond the grasp of the mind. Thus the mineral world understandeth neither the
                     nature nor the perfections of the vegetable world; the vegetable world understandeth
                     not the nature of the animal world, neither the animal world the nature of the reality
                     of man that discovereth and embraceth all things.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <a id="508500083" class="brl-location"></a>The animal is the captive of nature and cannot transgress the rules and laws thereof.
                     In man, however, there is a discovering power that transcendeth the world of nature
                     and controlleth and interfereth with the laws thereof. For instance, all minerals,
                     plants and animals are captives of nature. The sun itself with all its majesty is
                     so subservient to nature that it hath no will of its own and cannot deviate a hair’s-breadth
                     from the laws thereof. In like manner all other beings, whether of the mineral, the
                     vegetable or the animal world, cannot deviate from the laws of nature, nay, all are
                     the slaves thereof. Man, however, though in body the captive of nature is yet free
                     in his mind and soul, and hath the mastery over nature.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <a id="902098565" class="brl-location"></a>Consider: according to the law of nature man liveth, moveth and hath his being on
                     earth, yet his soul and mind interfere with the laws thereof, and even as the bird
                     he flieth in the air, saileth speedily upon the seas and as the fish soundeth the
                     deep and discovereth the things therein. Verily this is a grievous defeat inflicted
                     upon the laws of nature.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <a id="612747470" class="brl-location"></a>So is the power of electrical energy: this unruly violent force that cleaveth mountains
                     is yet imprisoned by man within a globe! This is manifestly interfering with the laws
                     of nature. Likewise man discovereth those hidden secrets of nature that in conformity
                     with the laws thereof must remain concealed, and transfereth them from the invisible
                     plane to the visible. This, too, is interfering with the law of nature. In the same
                     manner he discovereth the inherent properties of things that are the secrets of nature.
                     Also he bringeth to light the past events that have been lost to memory, and foreseeth
                     by his power of induction future happenings that are as yet unknown. Furthermore,
                     communication and discovery are limited by the laws of nature to short distances,
                     whereas man, through that inner power of his that discovereth the reality of all things,
                     connecteth the East with the West. This, too, is interfering with the laws of nature.
                     Similarly, according to the law of nature all shadows are fleeting, whereas man fixeth
                     them upon the plate, and this, too, is interference with a law of nature. Ponder and
                     reflect: all sciences, arts, crafts, inventions and discoveries, have been once the
                     secrets of nature and in conformity with the laws thereof must remain hidden; yet
                     man through his discovering power interfereth with the laws of nature and transfereth
                     these hidden secrets from the invisible to the visible plane. This again is interfering
                     with the laws of nature.

                     <a id="167900656" class="brl-location"></a>In fine, that inner faculty in man, unseen of the eye, wresteth the sword from the
                     hands of nature, and giveth it a grievous blow. All other beings, however great, are
                     bereft of such perfections. Man hath the powers of will and understanding, but nature
                     hath them not. Nature is constrained, man is free. Nature is bereft of understanding,
                     man understandeth. Nature is unaware of past events, but man is aware of them. Nature
                     forecasteth not the future; man by his discerning power seeth that which is to come.
                     Nature hath no consciousness of itself, man knoweth about all things.

                     <a id="462963613" class="brl-location"></a>Should any one suppose that man is but a part of the world of nature, and he being
                     endowed with these perfections, these being but manifestations of the world of nature,
                     and thus nature is the originator of these perfections and is not deprived therefrom,
                     to him we make reply and say: the part dependeth upon the whole; the part cannot possess
                     perfections whereof the whole is deprived.

                     <a id="495128940" class="brl-location"></a>By nature is meant those inherent properties and necessary relations derived from
                     the realities of things. And these realities of things, though in the utmost diversity,
                     are yet intimately connected one with the other. For these diverse realities an all-unifying
                     agency is needed that shall link them all one to the other. For instance, the various
                     organs and members, the parts and elements, that constitute the body of man, though
                     at variance, are yet all connected one with the other by that all-unifying agency
                     known as the human soul, that causeth them to function in perfect harmony and with
                     absolute regularity, thus making the continuation of life possible. The human body,
                     however, is utterly unconscious of that all-unifying agency, and yet acteth with regularity
                     and dischargeth its functions according to its will.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <a id="445977266" class="brl-location"></a>Now concerning philosophers, they are of two schools. Thus Socrates the wise believed
                     in the unity of God and the existence of the soul after death; as his opinion was
                     contrary to that of the narrow-minded people of his time, that divine sage was poisoned
                     by them. All divine philosophers and men of wisdom and understanding, when observing
                     these endless beings, have considered that in this great and infinite universe all
                     things end in the mineral kingdom, that the outcome of the mineral kingdom is the
                     vegetable kingdom, the outcome of the vegetable kingdom is the animal kingdom and
                     the outcome of the animal kingdom the world of man. The consummation of this limitless
                     universe with all its grandeur and glory hath been man himself, who in this world
                     of being toileth and suffereth for a time, with divers ills and pains, and ultimately
                     disintegrates, leaving no trace and no fruit after him. Were it so, there is no doubt
                     that this infinite universe with all its perfections has ended in sham and delusion
                     with no result, no fruit, no permanence and no effect. It would be utterly without
                     meaning. They were thus convinced that such is not the case, that this Great Workshop
                     with all its power, its bewildering magnificence and endless perfections, cannot eventually
                     come to naught. That still another life should exist is thus certain, and, just as
                     the vegetable kingdom is unaware of the world of man, so we, too, know not of the
                     Great Life hereafter that followeth the life of man here below. Our non-comprehension
                     of that life, however, is no proof of its non-existence. The mineral world, for instance,
                     is utterly unaware of the world of man and cannot comprehend it, but the ignorance
                     of a thing is no proof of its non-existence. Numerous and conclusive proofs exist
                     that go to show that this infinite world cannot end with this human life. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <a id="025820613" class="brl-location"></a>Now concerning the Essence of Divinity: in truth it is on no account determined by
                     anything apart from its own nature, and can in no wise be comprehended. For whatsoever
                     can be conceived by man is a reality that hath limitations and is not unlimited; it
                     is circumscribed, not all-embracing. It can be comprehended by man, and is controlled
                     by him. Similarly it is certain that all human conceptions are contingent, not absolute;
                     that they have a mental existence, not a material one. Moreover, differentiation of
                     stages in the contingent world is an obstacle to understanding. How then can the contingent
                     conceive the Reality of the absolute? As previously mentioned, differentiation of
                     stages in the contingent plane is an obstacle to understanding. Minerals, plants and
                     animals are bereft of the mental faculties of man that discover the realities of all
                     things, but man himself comprehendeth all the stages beneath him. Every superior stage
                     comprehendeth that which is inferior and discovereth the reality thereof, but the
                     inferior one is unaware of that which is superior and cannot comprehend it. Thus man
                     cannot grasp the Essence of Divinity, but can, by his reasoning power, by observation,
                     by his intuitive faculties and the revealing power of his faith, believe in God, discover
                     the bounties of His Grace. He becometh certain that though the Divine Essence is unseen
                     of the eye, and the existence of the Deity is intangible, yet conclusive spiritual
                     proofs assert the existence of that unseen Reality. The Divine Essence as it is in
                     itself is however beyond all description. For instance, the nature of ether is unknown,
                     but that it existeth is certain by the effects it produceth, heat, light and electricity
                     being the waves thereof. By these waves the existence of ether is thus proven. And
                     as we consider the outpourings of Divine Grace we are assured of the existence of
                     God. For instance, we observe that the existence of beings is conditioned upon the
                     coming together of various elements and their non-existence upon the decomposition
                     of their constituent elements. For decomposition causeth the dissociation of the various
                     elements. Thus, as we observe the coming together of elements giveth rise to the existence
                     of beings, and knowing that beings are infinite, they being the effect, how can the
                     Cause be finite?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <a id="207633941" class="brl-location"></a>Now, formation is of three kinds and of three kinds only: accidental, necessary and
                     voluntary. The coming together of the various constituent elements of beings cannot
                     be accidental, for unto every effect there must be a cause. It cannot be compulsory,
                     for then the formation must be an inherent property of the constituent parts and the
                     inherent property of a thing can in no wise be dissociated from it, such as light
                     that is the revealer of things, heat that causeth the expansion of elements and the
                     solar rays which are the essential property of the sun. Thus under such circumstances
                     the decomposition of any formation is impossible, for the inherent properties of a
                     thing cannot be separated from it. The third formation remaineth and that is the voluntary
                     one, that is, an unseen force described as the Ancient Power, causeth these elements
                     to come together, every formation giving rise to a distinct being.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <a id="584383128" class="brl-location"></a>As to the attributes and perfections such as will, knowledge, power and other ancient
                     attributes that we ascribe to that Divine Reality, these are the signs that reflect
                     the existence of beings in the visible plane and not the absolute perfections of the
                     Divine Essence that cannot be comprehended. For instance, as we consider created things
                     we observe infinite perfections, and the created things being in the utmost regularity
                     and perfection we infer that the Ancient Power on whom dependeth the existence of
                     these beings, cannot be ignorant; thus we say He is All-Knowing. It is certain that
                     it is not impotent, it must be then All-Powerful; it is not poor, it must be All-Possessing;
                     it is not non-existent, it must be Ever-Living. The purpose is to show that these
                     attributes and perfections that we recount for that Universal Reality are only in
                     order to deny imperfections, rather than to assert the perfections that the human
                     mind can conceive. Thus we say His attributes are unknowable.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <a id="403360984" class="brl-location"></a>In fine, that Universal Reality with all its qualities and attributes that we recount
                     is holy and exalted above all minds and understandings. As we, however, reflect with
                     broad minds upon this infinite universe, we observe that motion without a motive force,
                     and an effect without a cause are both impossible; that every being hath come to exist
                     under numerous influences and continually undergoeth reaction. These influences, too,
                     are formed under the action of still other influences. For instance, plants grow and
                     flourish through the outpourings of vernal showers, whilst the cloud itself is formed
                     under various other agencies and these agencies in their turn are reacted upon by
                     still other agencies. For example, plants and animals grow and develop under the influence
                     of what the philosophers of our day designate as hydrogen and oxygen and are reacted
                     upon by the effects of these two elements; and these in turn are formed under still
                     other influences. The same can be said of other beings whether they affect other things
                     or be affected. Such process of causation goes on, and to maintain that this process
                     goes on indefinitely is manifestly absurd. Thus such a chain of causation must of
                     necessity lead eventually to Him who is the Ever-Living, the All-Powerful, who is
                     Self-Dependent and the Ultimate Cause. This Universal Reality cannot be sensed, it
                     cannot be seen. It must be so of necessity, for it is All-Embracing, not circumscribed,
                     and such attributes qualify the effect and not the cause.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <a id="146192075" class="brl-location"></a>And as we reflect, we observe that man is like unto a tiny organism contained within
                     a fruit; this fruit hath developed out of the blossom, the blossom hath grown out
                     of the tree, the tree is sustained by the sap, and the sap formed out of earth and
                     water. How then can this tiny organism comprehend the nature of the garden, conceive
                     of the gardener and comprehend his being? That is manifestly impossible. Should that
                     organism understand and reflect, it would observe that this garden, this tree, this
                     blossom, this fruit would in no wise have come to exist by themselves in such order
                     and perfection. Similarly the wise and reflecting soul will know of a certainty that
                     this infinite universe with all its grandeur and perfect order could not have come
                     to exist by itself.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <a id="283751965" class="brl-location"></a>Similarly in the world of being there exist forces unseen of the eye, such as the
                     force of ether previously  mentioned, that cannot be sensed, that cannot be seen.
                     However, from the effects it produceth, that is from its waves and vibrations, light,
                     heat, electricity appear and are made evident. In like manner is the power of growth,
                     of feeling, of understanding, of thought, of memory, of imagination and of discernment;
                     all these inner faculties are unseen of the eye and cannot be sensed, yet all are
                     evident by the effects they produce.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <a id="232862448" class="brl-location"></a>Now as to the infinite Power that knoweth no limitations; limitation itself proveth
                     the existence of the unlimited, for the limited is known through the unlimited, just
                     as weakness itself proveth the existence of power, ignorance the existence of knowledge,
                     poverty the existence of wealth. Without wealth there would be no poverty, without
                     knowledge no ignorance, without light no darkness. Darkness itself is a proof of the
                     existence of light for darkness is the absence of light.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <a id="972858752" class="brl-location"></a>Now concerning nature, it is but the essential properties and the necessary relations
                     inherent in the realities of things. And though these infinite realities are diverse
                     in their character yet they are in the utmost harmony and closely connected together.
                     As one’s vision is broadened and the matter observed carefully, it will be made certain
                     that every reality is but an essential requisite of other realities. Thus to connect
                     and harmonize these diverse and infinite realities an all-unifying Power is necessary,
                     that every part of existent being may in perfect order discharge its own function.
                     Consider the body of man, and let the part be an indication of the whole. Consider
                     how these diverse parts and members of the human body are closely connected and harmoniously
                     united one with the other. Every part is the essential requisite of all other parts
                     and has a function by itself. It is the mind that is the all-unifying agency that
                     so uniteth all the component parts one with the other that each dischargeth its specific
                     function in perfect order, and thereby co-operation and reaction are made possible.
                     All parts function under certain laws that are essential to existence. Should that
                     all-unifying agency that directeth all these parts be harmed in any way there is no
                     doubt that the constituent parts and members will cease functioning properly; and
                     though that all-unifying agency in the temple of man be not sensed or seen and the
                     reality thereof be unknown, yet by its effects it manifesteth itself with the greatest
                     power.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <a id="132158401" class="brl-location"></a>Thus it hath been proven and made evident that these infinite beings in this wondrous
                     universe will discharge their functions properly only when directed and controlled
                     by that Universal Reality,  so that order may be established in the world. For example,
                     interaction and co-operation between the constituent parts of the human body are evident
                     and indisputable, yet this does not suffice; an all-unifying agency is necessary that
                     shall direct and control the component parts, so that these through interaction and
                     co-operation may discharge in perfect order their necessary and respective functions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <a id="009842209" class="brl-location"></a>You are well aware, praised be the Lord, that both interaction and co-operation are
                     evident and proven amongst all beings, whether large or small. In the case of large
                     bodies interaction is as manifest as the sun, whilst in the case of small bodies,
                     though interaction be unknown, yet the part is an indication of the whole. All these
                     interactions therefore are connected with that all-embracing power which is their
                     pivot, their centre, their source and their motive power.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <a id="000714422" class="brl-location"></a>For instance, as we have observed, co-operation among the constituent parts of the
                     human body is clearly established, and these parts and members render services unto
                     all the component parts of the body. For instance, the hand, the foot, the eye, the
                     ear, the mind, the imagination all help the various parts and members of the human
                     body, but all these interactions are linked by an unseen, all-embracing power, that
                     causeth these interactions to be produced  with perfect regularity. This is the inner
                     faculty of man, that is his spirit and his mind, both of which are invisible.

                     <a id="008145504" class="brl-location"></a>In like manner consider machinery and workshops and the interaction existing among
                     the various component parts and sections, and how connected they are one with the
                     other. All these relations and interactions, however, are connected with a central
                     power which is their motive force, their pivot and their source. This central power
                     is either the power of steam or the skill of the mastermind.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <a id="741653151" class="brl-location"></a>It hath therefore been made evident and proved that interaction, co-operation and
                     interrelation amongst beings are under the direction and will of a motive Power which
                     is the origin, the motive force and the pivot of all interactions in the universe.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <a id="407435141" class="brl-location"></a>Likewise every arrangement and formation that is not perfect in its order we designate
                     as accidental, and that which is orderly, regular, perfect in its relations and every
                     part of which is in its proper place and is the essential requisite of the other constituent
                     parts, this we call a composition formed through will and knowledge. There is no doubt
                     that these infinite beings and the association of these diverse elements arranged
                     in countless forms must have proceeded from a Reality that could in no wise be bereft
                     of will or understanding. This is clear and proven to the mind and no one can deny
                     it. It is not meant, however, that that Universal Reality or the attributes thereof
                     have been comprehended. Neither its Essence nor its true attributes hath any one comprehended.
                     We maintain, however, that these infinite beings, these necessary relations, this
                     perfect arrangement must of necessity have proceeded from a source that is not bereft
                     of will and understanding, and this infinite composition cast into infinite forms
                     must have been caused by an all-embracing Wisdom. This none can dispute save he that
                     is obstinate and stubborn, and denieth the clear and unmistakable evidence, and becometh
                     the object of the blessed Verse: ‘They are deaf, they are dumb, they are blind and
                     shall return no more’.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <a id="995587026" class="brl-location"></a>Now regarding the question whether the faculties of the mind and the human soul are
                     one and the same. These faculties are but the inherent properties of the soul, such
                     as the power of imagination, of thought, of understanding; powers that are the essential
                     requisites of the reality of man, even as the solar ray is the inherent property of
                     the sun. The temple of man is like unto a mirror, his soul is as the sun, and his
                     mental faculties even as the rays that emanate from that source of light. The ray
                     may cease to fall upon the mirror, but it can in no wise be dissociated from the sun.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <a id="642069677" class="brl-location"></a>In short, the point is this, that the world of man is supernatural in its relation
                     to the vegetable kingdom, though in reality it is not so. Relatively to the plant,
                     the reality of man, his power of hearing and sight, are all supernatural, and for
                     the plant to comprehend that reality and the nature of the powers of man’s mind is
                     impossible. In like manner for man to comprehend the Divine Essence and the nature
                     of the great Hereafter is in no wise possible. The merciful outpourings of that Divine
                     Essence, however, are vouchsafed unto all beings and it is incumbent upon man to ponder
                     in his heart upon the effusions of the Divine Grace, the soul being counted as one,
                     rather than upon the Divine Essence itself. This is the utmost limit for human understanding.
                     As it hath previously been mentioned, these attributes and perfections that we recount
                     of the Divine Essence, these we have derived from the existence and observation of
                     beings, and it is not that we have comprehended the essence and perfection of God.
                     When we say that the Divine Essence understandeth and is free, we do not mean that
                     we have discovered the Divine Will and Purpose, but rather that we have acquired knowledge
                     of them through the Divine Grace revealed and manifested in the realities of things.

                     <a id="144989970" class="brl-location"></a>Now concerning our social principles, namely the teachings of His Holiness Bahá’u’lláh
                     spread far and wide fifty years ago, they verily comprehend all other teachings. It
                     is clear and evident that without these teachings progress and advancement for mankind
                     are in no wise possible. Every community in the world findeth in these Divine Teachings
                     the realization of its highest aspirations. These teachings are even as the tree that
                     beareth the best fruits of all trees. Philosophers, for instance, find in these heavenly
                     teachings the most perfect solution of their social problems, and similarly a true
                     and noble exposition of matters that pertain to philosophical questions. In like manner
                     men of faith behold the reality of religion manifestly revealed in these heavenly
                     teachings, and clearly and conclusively prove them to be the real and true remedy
                     for the ills and infirmities of all mankind. Should these sublime teachings be diffused,
                     mankind shall be freed from all perils, from all chronic ills and sicknesses. In like
                     manner are the Bahá’í economic principles the embodiment of the highest aspirations
                     of all wage-earning classes and of economists of various schools.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <a id="786461194" class="brl-location"></a>In short, all sections and parties have their aspirations realized in the teachings
                     of Bahá’u’lláh. As these teachings are declared in churches, in mosques and in other
                     places of worship, whether those of the followers of Buddha or of Confucius, in political
                     circles or amongst materialists, all shall bear witness that these teachings bestow
                     a fresh life upon mankind and constitute the immediate remedy for all the ills of
                     social life. None can find fault with any of these teachings, nay rather, once declared
                     they will all be acclaimed, and all will confess their vital necessity, exclaiming,
                     ‘Verily this is the truth and naught is there beside the truth but manifest error.’
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <a id="528665976" class="brl-location"></a>In conclusion, these few words are written, and unto everyone they will be a clear
                     and conclusive evidence of the truth. Ponder them in thine heart. The will of every
                     sovereign prevaileth during his reign, the will of every philosopher findeth expression
                     in a handful of disciples during his lifetime, but the Power of the Holy Spirit shineth
                     radiantly in the realities of the Messengers of God, and strengtheneth Their will
                     in such wise as to influence a great nation for thousands of years and to regenerate
                     the human soul and revive mankind. Consider how great is this power! It is an extraordinary
                     Power, an all-sufficient proof of the truth of the mission of the Prophets of God,
                     and a conclusive evidence of the power of Divine Inspiration.
