                              requirement to face the Qiblih during its recitation. “Alláh-u-Abhá” is said once;

                           Thy grace which shineth from the horizon of Thy Name, the Ever-Forgiving, to grant
                           me Thy pardon and to have mercy upon me. Write down, then, for me with Thy pen of

                           nations has been powerless to withhold from Thee, and who, advancing towards Thee,
                           have said: “God is our Lord, the Lord of all who are in heaven and all who are on

                           most Exalted Remembrance, and by Thy pure and spotless Beauty, and by Thy hidden Light

                           no created thing can ever be associated with Thee, nor can aught comprehend Thee?
                           How is it possible for a lowly servant to recognize Thee and to extol Thy praise,
                           notwithstanding that Thou hast destined for him the revelations of Thy dominion and
                           the wondrous testimonies of Thy sovereignty? Thus every created thing beareth witness
                           that it is debarred from the sanctuary of Thy presence by reason of the limitations
                           imposed upon its inner reality. It is undisputed, however, that the influence of Thine
                           attraction hath everlastingly been inherent in the realities of Thy handiwork, although
                           that which beseemeth the hallowed court of Thy providence is exalted beyond the attainment
                           of the entire creation. This indicateth, O my God, my utter powerlessness to praise
                           Thee and revealeth my utmost impotence in yielding thanks unto Thee; and how much
                           more to attain the recognition of Thy divine unity or to succeed in reaching the clear
                           tokens of Thy praise, Thy sanctity and Thy glory. Nay, by Thy might, I yearn for naught
                           but Thine Own Self and seek no one other than Thee.

                           power of Thy decree and been fashioned through the potency of Thy will. And at whatever

                           eyes have, at all times, been bent upon the Dayspring of Thy loving-kindness, and
                           their faces set towards the Fountainhead of Thine inspiration. Rain down, then, upon
                           us and upon them from the clouds of Thy mercy what beseemeth the heaven of Thy bounteousness
                           and grace.

                           Thy bounty before the faces of Thy creatures, and opened wide the portals of Thy tender
                           mercy unto all the dwellers of Thine earth. I beseech Thee, by all them whose blood
                           was shed in Thy path, who, in their yearning over Thee, rid themselves from all attachment
                           to any of Thy creatures, and who were so carried away by the sweet savors of Thine
                           inspiration that every single member of their bodies intoned Thy praise and vibrated
                           to Thy remembrance, not to withhold from us the things Thou hast irrevocably ordained
                           in this Revelation—a Revelation the potency of which hath caused every tree to cry
                           out what the Burning Bush had aforetime proclaimed unto Moses, Who conversed with
                           Thee, a Revelation that hath enabled every least pebble to resound again with Thy
                           praise, as the stones glorified Thee in the days of Muḥammad, Thy Friend.

                           shadow, and didst cause them to enter into the precincts of Thy court. Now that Thou
                           hast made them to abide under the shade of the canopy of Thy mercy, do Thou assist
                           them to attain what must befit so august a station. Suffer them not, O my Lord, to
                           be numbered with them who, though enjoying near access to Thee, have been kept back
                           from recognizing Thy face, and who, though meeting with Thee, are deprived of Thy
                           presence.

                           upon them what will thoroughly purge them of all that Thou abhorrest, that they may
                           be wholly devoted to Thee, and may detach themselves entirely from all except Thyself.

                           up throughout Thy realm. Some were ensnared by the infidels in Thy land, and were
                           hindered by them from having near access to Thee and from attaining the court of Thy
                           glory. Others were able to approach Thee, but were kept back from beholding Thy face.
                           Still others were permitted, in their eagerness to look upon Thee, to enter the precincts

                           the wrongs inflicted by the oppressors among Thy people to come in between them and
                           Thee.

                           of all attachment to anyone but Thee, and that out of their hearts may ascend that
                           which will be worthy of the court of Thy majesty and may well beseem the seat of the

                           life-giving waters and may yield the virtue wherewith Thou hast endowed it. Cleanse
                           Thou by its means the hearts of Thy servants whom the evils of the world have failed
                           to hinder from turning towards Thine all-glorious Name, and who have remained unmoved
                           by the noise and tumult of such as have repudiated Thy most resplendent signs which

                           not Thy sincere servants of the wonders of Thy tender mercies and loving-kindness.
                           Forgiving and Most Bountiful art Thou, O my Lord! Power hast Thou to do what Thou

                           as lost in the face of the evidences of Thy wealth, are as nothing when compared with

                           when face to face with the signs and tokens of Thy power. What refuge is there beside
                           Thee, O my Lord, to which I can flee, and where is there a haven to which I can hasten?
                           Nay, the power of Thy might beareth me witness! No protector is there but Thee, no

                           is therein, and will set his face towards Thee, cleansed from the remembrance of anyone

                           and for the sake of Thy pleasure, and all that we have left undone as a result of
                           our subjection to our evil and corrupt desires. Enable us, then, to cleave steadfastly
                           to Thy love and Thy good pleasure, and preserve us from the mischief of such as have
                           denied Thee and repudiated Thy most resplendent signs. Thou art, in truth, the Lord

                           through Whom all the knowledge of the past and all the knowledge of the future were

                           gathered together, Whom Thou hast called ‘Alí-Muḥammad in the kingdom of Thy names,

                           all Thine attributes and titles to attain their final consummation. To Him also belong

                           ere He had established His own covenant. He it is Whose praise the Bayán hath celebrated.
                           In it His excellence hath been extolled, and His truth established, and His sovereignty

                           have shed their radiance in the heaven of Thine irrevocable decree, and the Beauty

                           love of Thee, have observed all whereunto they were bidden, to remove the veils that
