                     <a id="329760194" class="brl-location"></a>The enduring legacy of the twentieth century is that it compelled the peoples of the
                     world to begin seeing themselves as the members of a single human race, and the earth
                     as that race’s common homeland. Despite the continuing conflict and violence that
                     darken the horizon, prejudices that once seemed inherent in the nature of the human
                     species are everywhere giving way. Down with them come barriers that long divided
                     the family of man into a Babel of incoherent identities of cultural, ethnic or national
                     origin. That so fundamental a change could occur in so brief a period—virtually overnight
                     in the perspective of historical time—suggests the magnitude of the possibilities
                     for the future.

                     <a id="047519634" class="brl-location"></a>Tragically, organized religion, whose very reason for being entails service to the
                     cause of brotherhood and peace, behaves all too frequently as one of the most formidable
                     obstacles in the path; to cite a particular painful fact, it has long lent its credibility
                     to fanaticism. We feel a responsibility, as the governing council of one of the world
                     religions, to urge earnest consideration of the challenge this poses for religious
                     leadership. Both the issue and the circumstances to which it gives rise require that
                     we speak frankly. We trust that common service to the Divine will ensure that what
                     we say will be received in the same spirit of goodwill as it is put forward.

                     <a id="313960296" class="brl-location"></a>The issue comes sharply into focus when one considers what has been achieved elsewhere.
                     In the past, apart from isolated exceptions, women were regarded as an inferior breed,
                     their nature hedged about by superstitions, denied the opportunity to express the
                     potentialities of the human spirit and relegated to the role of serving the needs
                     of men. Clearly, there are many societies where such conditions persist and are even
                     fanatically defended. At the level of global discourse, however, the concept of the
                     equality of the sexes has, for all practical purposes, now assumed the force of universally
                     accepted principle. It enjoys similar authority in most of the academic community
                     and information media. So basic has been the revisioning that exponents of male supremacy
                     must look for support on the margins of responsible opinion.
                  </p>
                  <p class="brl-muhj-paragraph">
                     <a id="781003701" class="brl-location"></a>The beleaguered battalions of nationalism face a similar fate. With each passing crisis
                     in world affairs, it becomes easier for the citizen to distinguish between a love
                     of country that enriches one’s life, and submission to inflammatory rhetoric designed
                     to provoke hatred and fear of others. Even where it is expedient to participate in
                     the familiar nationalistic rites, public response is as often marked by feelings of
                     awkwardness as it is by the strong convictions and ready enthusiasm of earlier times.
                     The effect has been reinforced by the restructuring steadily taking place in the international
                     order. Whatever the shortcomings of the United Nations system in its present form,
                     and however handicapped its ability to take collective military action against aggression,
                     no one can mistake the fact that the fetish of absolute national sovereignty is on
                     its way to extinction.

                     <a id="544808152" class="brl-location"></a>Racial and ethnic prejudices have been subjected to equally summary treatment by historical
                     processes that have little patience left for such pretensions. Here, rejection of
                     the past has been especially decisive. Racism is now tainted by its association with
                     the horrors of the twentieth century to the degree that it has taken on something
                     of the character of a spiritual disease. While surviving as a social attitude in many
                     parts of the world—and as a blight on the lives of a significant segment of humankind—racial
                     prejudice has become so universally condemned in principle that no body of people
                     can any longer safely allow themselves to be identified with it.

                     <a id="633856349" class="brl-location"></a>It is not that a dark past has been erased and a new world of light has suddenly been
                     born. Vast numbers of people continue to endure the effects of ingrained prejudices
                     of ethnicity, gender, nation, caste and class. All the evidence indicates that such
                     injustices will long persist as the institutions and standards that humanity is devising
                     only slowly become empowered to construct a new order of relationships and to bring
                     relief to the oppressed. The point, rather, is that a threshold has been crossed from
                     which there is no credible possibility of return. Fundamental principles have been
                     identified, articulated, accorded broad publicity and are becoming progressively incarnated
                     in institutions capable of imposing them on public behaviour. There is no doubt that,
                     however protracted and painful the struggle, the outcome will be to revolutionize
                     relationships among all peoples, at the grassroots level.

                     <a id="233838035" class="brl-location"></a>As the twentieth century opened, the prejudice that seemed more likely than any other
                     to succumb to the forces of change was that of religion. In the West, scientific advances
                     had already dealt rudely with some of the central pillars of sectarian exclusivity.
                     In the context of the transformation taking place in the human race’s conception of
                     itself, the most promising new religious development seemed to be the interfaith movement.
                     In 1893, the World’s Columbian Exposition surprised even its ambitious organizers
                     by giving birth to the famed “Parliament of Religions”, a vision of spiritual and
                     moral consensus that captured the popular imagination on all continents and managed
                     to eclipse even the scientific, technological and commercial wonders that the Exposition
                     celebrated. 
                  </p>
                  <p class="brl-muhj-paragraph">
                     <a id="195254150" class="brl-location"></a>Briefly, it appeared that ancient walls had fallen. For influential thinkers in the
                     field of religion, the gathering stood unique, “unprecedented in the history of the
                     world”. The Parliament had, its distinguished principal organizer said, “emancipated
                     the world from bigotry”. An imaginative leadership, it was confidently predicted,
                     would seize the opportunity and awaken in the earth’s long-divided religious communities
                     a spirit of brotherhood that could provide the needed moral underpinnings for the
                     new world of prosperity and progress. Thus encouraged, interfaith movements of every
                     kind took root and flourished. A vast literature, available in many languages, introduced
                     an ever wider public, believers and non-believers alike, to the teachings of all the
                     major faiths, an interest picked up in due course by radio, television, film and eventually
                     the Internet. Institutions of higher learning launched degree programmes in the study
                     of comparative religion. By the time the century ended, interfaith worship services,
                     unthinkable only a few decades earlier, were becoming commonplace.
                  </p>
                  <p class="brl-muhj-paragraph">
                     <a id="462192925" class="brl-location"></a>Alas, it is clear that these initiatives lack both intellectual coherence and spiritual
                     commitment. In contrast to the processes of unification that are transforming the
                     rest of humanity’s social relationships, the suggestion that all of the world’s great
                     religions are equally valid in nature and origin is stubbornly resisted by entrenched
                     patterns of sectarian thought. The progress of racial integration is a development
                     that is not merely an expression of sentimentality or strategy but arises from the
                     recognition that the earth’s peoples constitute a single species whose many variations
                     do not themselves confer any advantage or impose any handicap on individual members
                     of the race. The emancipation of women, likewise, has entailed the willingness of
                     both society’s institutions and popular opinion to acknowledge that there are no acceptable
                     grounds—biological, social or moral—to justify denying women full equality with men,
                     and girls equal educational opportunities with boys. Nor does appreciation of the
                     contributions that some nations are making to the shaping of an evolving global civilization
                     support the inherited illusion that other nations have little or nothing to bring
                     to the effort.

                     <a id="247064149" class="brl-location"></a>So fundamental a reorientation religious leadership appears, for the most part, unable
                     to undertake. Other segments of society embrace the implications of the oneness of
                     humankind, not only as the inevitable next step in the advancement of civilization,
                     but as the fulfilment of lesser identities of every kind that our race brings to this
                     critical moment in our collective history. Yet, the greater part of organized religion
                     stands paralyzed at the threshold of the future, gripped in those very dogmas and
                     claims of privileged access to truth that have been responsible for creating some
                     of the most bitter conflicts dividing the earth’s inhabitants.

                     to cite in detail the horrors being visited upon hapless populations today by outbursts
                     of fanaticism that shame the name of religion. Nor is the phenomenon a recent one.
                     To take only one of many examples, Europe’s sixteenth century wars of religion cost
                     that continent the lives of some thirty percent of its entire population. One must
                     wonder what has been the longer term harvest of the seeds planted in popular consciousness
                     by the blind forces of sectarian dogmatism that inspired such conflicts.

                     <a id="274304206" class="brl-location"></a>To this accounting must be added a betrayal of the life of the mind which, more than
                     any other factor, has robbed religion of the capacity it inherently possesses to play
                     a decisive role in the shaping of world affairs. Locked into preoccupation with agendas
                     that disperse and vitiate human energies, religious institutions have too often been
                     the chief agents in discouraging exploration of reality and the exercise of those
                     intellectual faculties that distinguish humankind. Denunciations of materialism or
                     terrorism are of no real assistance in coping with the contemporary moral crisis if
                     they do not begin by addressing candidly the failure of responsibility that has left
                     believing masses exposed and vulnerable to these influences.

                     a reminder of the unique power it represents. Religion, as we are all aware, reaches
                     to the roots of motivation. When it has been faithful to the spirit and example of
                     the transcendent Figures who gave the world its great belief systems, it has awakened
                     in whole populations capacities to love, to forgive, to create, to dare greatly, to
                     overcome prejudice, to sacrifice for the common good and to discipline the impulses
                     of animal instinct. Unquestionably, the seminal force in the civilizing of human nature
                     has been the influence of the succession of these Manifestations of the Divine that
                     extends back to the dawn of recorded history.
                  </p>

                     <a id="422328019" class="brl-location"></a>This same force, that operated with such effect in ages past, remains an inextinguishable
                     feature of human consciousness. Against all odds, and with little in the way of meaningful
                     encouragement, it continues to sustain the struggle for survival of uncounted millions,
                     and to raise up in all lands heroes and saints whose lives are the most persuasive
                     vindication of the principles contained in the scriptures of their respective faiths.
                     As the course of civilization demonstrates, religion is also capable of profoundly
                     influencing the structure of social relationships. Indeed, it would be difficult to
                     think of any fundamental advance in civilization that did not derive its moral thrust
                     from this perennial source. Is it conceivable, then, that passage to the culminating
                     stage in the millennia-long process of the organization of the planet can be accomplished
                     in a spiritual vacuum? If the perverse ideologies let loose on our world during the
                     century just past contributed nothing else, they demonstrated conclusively that the
                     need cannot be met by alternatives that lie within the power of human invention.

                     that, in winding their roots around the life of the spirit, have been the greatest
                     single factor in suffocating impulses to unity and in promoting hatred and violence.

                     <a id="096159970" class="brl-location"></a>It is to this historic challenge that we believe leaders of religion must respond
                     if religious leadership is to have meaning in the global society emerging from the
                     transformative experiences of the twentieth century. It is evident that growing numbers
                     of people are coming to realize that the truth underlying all religions is in its
                     essence one. This recognition arises not through a resolution of theological disputes,
                     but as an intuitive awareness born from the ever widening experience of others and
                     from a dawning acceptance of the oneness of the human family itself. Out of the welter
                     of religious doctrines, rituals and legal codes inherited from vanished worlds, there
                     is emerging a sense that spiritual life, like the oneness manifest in diverse nationalities,
                     races and cultures, constitutes one unbounded reality equally accessible to everyone.
                     In order for this diffuse and still tentative perception to consolidate itself and
                     contribute effectively to the building of a peaceful world, it must have the wholehearted
                     confirmation of those to whom, even at this late hour, masses of the earth’s population
                     look for guidance.

                     <a id="345759000" class="brl-location"></a>There are certainly wide differences among the world’s major religious traditions
                     with respect to social ordinances and forms of worship. Given the thousands of years
                     during which successive revelations of the Divine have addressed the changing needs
                     of a constantly evolving civilization, it could hardly be otherwise. Indeed, an inherent
                     feature of the scriptures of most of the major faiths would appear to be the expression,
                     in some form or other, of the principle of religion’s evolutionary nature. What cannot
                     be morally justified is the manipulation of cultural legacies that were intended to
                     enrich spiritual experience, as a means to arouse prejudice and alienation. The primary
                     task of the soul will always be to investigate reality, to live in accordance with
                     the truths of which it becomes persuaded and to accord full respect to the efforts
                     of others to do the same. 
                  </p>
                  <p class="brl-muhj-paragraph">
                     <a id="295679383" class="brl-location"></a>It may be objected that, if all the great religions are to be recognized as equally
                     Divine in origin, the effect will be to encourage, or at least to facilitate, the
                     conversion of numbers of people from one religion to another. Whether or not this
                     is true, it is surely of peripheral importance when set against the opportunity that
                     history has at last opened to those who are conscious of a world that transcends this
                     terrestrial one—and against the responsibility that this awareness imposes. Each of
                     the great faiths can adduce impressive and credible testimony to its efficacy in nurturing
                     moral character. Similarly, no one could convincingly argue that doctrines attached
                     to one particular belief system have been either more or less prolific in generating
                     bigotry and superstition than those attached to any other. In an integrating world,
                     it is natural that patterns of response and association will undergo a continuous
                     process of shifting, and the role of institutions, of whatever kind, is surely to
                     consider how these developments can be managed in a way that promotes unity. The guarantee
                     that the outcome will ultimately be sound—spiritually, morally and socially—lies in
                     the abiding faith of the unconsulted masses of the earth’s inhabitants that the universe
                     is ruled not by human caprice, but by a loving and unfailing Providence.

                     <a id="644309582" class="brl-location"></a>Together with the crumbling of barriers separating peoples, our age is witnessing
                     the dissolution of the once insuperable wall that the past assumed would forever separate
                     the life of Heaven from the life of Earth. The scriptures of all religions have always
                     taught the believer to see in service to others not only a moral duty, but an avenue
                     for the soul’s own approach to God. Today, the progressive restructuring of society
                     gives this familiar teaching new dimensions of meaning. As the age-old promise of
                     a world animated by principles of justice slowly takes on the character of a realistic
                     goal, meeting the needs of the soul and those of society will increasingly be seen
                     as reciprocal aspects of a mature spiritual life.

                     <a id="897725762" class="brl-location"></a>If religious leadership is to rise to the challenge that this latter perception represents,
                     such response must begin by acknowledging that religion and science are the two indispensable
                     knowledge systems through which the potentialities of consciousness develop. Far from
                     being in conflict with one another, these fundamental modes of the mind’s exploration
                     of reality are mutually dependent and have been most productive in those rare but
                     happy periods of history when their complementary nature has been recognized and they
                     have been able to work together. The insights and skills generated by scientific advance
                     will have always to look to the guidance of spiritual and moral commitment to ensure
                     their appropriate application; religious convictions, no matter how cherished they
                     may be, must submit, willingly and gratefully, to impartial testing by scientific
                     methods.

                     <a id="329400083" class="brl-location"></a>We come finally to an issue that we approach with some diffidence as it touches most
                     directly on conscience. Among the many temptations the world offers, the test that
                     has, not surprisingly, preoccupied religious leaders is that of exercising power in
                     matters of belief. No one who has dedicated long years to earnest meditation and study
                     of the scriptures of one or another of the great religions requires any further reminder
                     of the oft-repeated axiom regarding the potentiality of power to corrupt and to do
                     so increasingly as such power grows. The unheralded inner victories won in this respect
                     by unnumbered clerics all down the ages have no doubt been one of the chief sources
                     of organized religion’s creative strength and must rank as one of its highest distinctions.
                     To the same degree, surrender to the lure of worldly power and advantage, on the part
                     of other religious leaders, has cultivated a fertile breeding ground for cynicism,
                     corruption and despair among all who observe it. The implications for the ability
                     of religious leadership to fulfil its social responsibility at this point in history
                     need no elaboration.

                     <a id="746788789" class="brl-location"></a>Because it is concerned with the ennobling of character and the harmonizing of relationships,
                     religion has served throughout history as the ultimate authority in giving meaning
                     to life. In every age, it has cultivated the good, reproved the wrong and held up,
                     to the gaze of all those willing to see, a vision of potentialities as yet unrealized.
                     From its counsels the rational soul has derived encouragement in overcoming limits
                     imposed by the world and in fulfilling itself. As the name implies, religion has simultaneously
                     been the chief force binding diverse peoples together in ever larger and more complex
                     societies through which the individual capacities thus released can find expression.
                     The great advantage of the present age is the perspective that makes it possible for
                     the entire human race to see this civilizing process as a single phenomenon, the ever-recurring
                     encounters of our world with the world of God.

                     interfaith activities from the time of their inception. Apart from cherished associations
                     that these activities create, Bahá’ís see in the struggle of diverse religions to
                     draw closer together a response to the Divine Will for a human race that is entering
                     on its collective maturity. The members of our community will continue to assist in
                     every way we can. We owe it to our partners in this common effort, however, to state
                     clearly our conviction that interfaith discourse, if it is to contribute meaningfully
                     to healing the ills that afflict a desperate humanity, must now address honestly and
                     without further evasion the implications of the over-arching truth that called the
                     movement into being: that God is one and that, beyond all diversity of cultural expression
                     and human interpretation, religion is likewise one.

                     will ignite a worldwide conflagration the consequences of which are unthinkable. Such
                     a danger civil government, unaided, cannot overcome. Nor should we delude ourselves
                     that appeals for mutual tolerance can alone hope to extinguish animosities that claim
                     to possess Divine sanction. The crisis calls on religious leadership for a break with
                     the past as decisive as those that opened the way for society to address equally corrosive
                     prejudices of race, gender and nation. Whatever justification exists for exercising
                     influence in matters of conscience lies in serving the well-being of humankind. At
                     this greatest turning point in the history of civilization, the demands of such service
                     could not be more clear. “The well-being of mankind, its peace and security, are unattainable”,
