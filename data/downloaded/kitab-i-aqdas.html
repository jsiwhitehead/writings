                     <a id="307417904" class="brl-location"></a>In 1953 Shoghi Effendi, the Guardian of the Bahá’í Faith, included as one of the goals
                     of his Ten Year Plan the preparation of a Synopsis and Codification of the Laws and
                     Ordinances of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas as an essential prelude to its translation. He himself
                     worked on the codification, but had not finished it when he died in 1957. The task
                     was continued on the basis of his work, and the resulting volume was released in 1973.
                     That publication included, in addition to the Synopsis and Codification itself and
                     explanatory notes, a compilation of the passages from the Kitáb-i-Aqdas which had
                     already been translated by Shoghi Effendi and published in various books. The Synopsis
                     and Codification covered the text of both the Kitáb-i-Aqdas and the Questions and
                     Answers which constitutes an appendix to the Aqdas. In 1986 the Universal House of
                     Justice decided that the time had come when the preparation of an English translation
                     of the complete text of the Most Holy Book was both possible and essential and made
                     its accomplishment a goal of the Six Year Plan 1986–1992. Its publication in English
                     will be followed by translations in other languages.

                     <a id="111994742" class="brl-location"></a>It has been recognized that the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, being Sacred Scripture, should be presented
                     in a form which can be read with ease and inspiration, uncluttered with the footnotes
                     and index numbers that are common in scholarly texts. Nonetheless, to assist the reader
                     in following the flow of the text and its changing themes, paragraph divisions have
                     been added—such divisions not being common in works of Arabic literature—and these
                     paragraphs have then  been numbered for ease of access and indexing, as well as for
                     uniformity of reference in all the languages in which the work will be published.

                     <a id="829973374" class="brl-location"></a>Following the text of the Aqdas is a brief compilation of Writings of Bahá’u’lláh
                     which are supplementary to the Most Holy Book, and a translation of the Questions
                     and Answers published here for the first time.

                     <a id="355672999" class="brl-location"></a>Shoghi Effendi had stated that the English translation of the Aqdas should be <span>“copiously annotated.”</span> The policy followed in preparing the notes has been to concentrate on those points
                     which might strike a non-Arabic-speaking reader as obscure or which, for various reasons,
                     require elucidation or background information. They are not intended to be a comprehensive
                     commentary on the text beyond these fundamental requirements.

                     <a id="958084023" class="brl-location"></a>The notes, which are placed following the Synopsis and Codification, are numbered
                     sequentially. Each is preceded by a quotation of the passage to which it relates,
                     and indicates the number of the paragraph in which this appears. This facilitates
                     cross-reference between the text and the notes, while making it possible for readers
                     to study the notes without repeatedly consulting the text, if they so prefer. It is
                     hoped in this way to meet the needs of readers of a wide range of backgrounds and
                     interests.

                     have been graphically depicted by Shoghi Effendi in his history of the first Bahá’í
                     century entitled <em>God Passes By</em>. As an assistance to the reader, these passages are provided in the section that
                     immediately follows the introduction. The Synopsis and Codification, which is republished
                     in this volume, serves as another aid for obtaining an overview of the Book.

                     <a id="331207233" class="brl-location"></a>This year, the 149th of the Bahá’í era, marks the Centenary of the Ascension of Bahá’u’lláh,
                     Bearer of the universal Revelation of God destined to lead humanity to its collective
                     coming of age. That this occasion should be observed by a community of believers representing
                     a cross-section of the entire human race and established, in the course of a century
                     and a half, in the most remote corners of the globe, is a token of the forces of unity
                     released by Bahá’u’lláh’s advent. A further testimony to the operation of these same
                     forces can be seen in the extent to which Bahá’u’lláh’s vision has prefigured contemporary
                     human experience in so many of its aspects. It is a propitious moment for the publication
                     of this first authorized translation into English of the Mother Book of His Revelation,
                     His <span>“Most Holy Book,”</span> the Book in which He sets forth the Laws of God for a Dispensation destined to endure
                     for no less than a thousand years.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <a id="717072898" class="brl-location"></a>Of the more than one hundred volumes comprising the sacred Writings of Bahá’u’lláh,
                     the Kitáb-i-Aqdas is of unique importance. <span class="brl-italic">“To build anew the whole world”</span> is the claim and challenge of His Message, and the Kitáb-i-Aqdas is the Charter of
                     the future world civilization that Bahá’u’lláh has come to raise up. Its provisions
                     rest squarely on the foundation established by past religions, for, in the words of
                     Bahá’u’lláh, <span class="brl-italic">“This is the changeless Faith of God, eternal in the past, eternal in the future.”</span> In this Revelation the concepts of the past are brought to a new level of understanding,
                     and the social laws, changed to suit the age  now dawning, are designed to carry humanity
                     forward into a world civilization the splendors of which can as yet be scarcely imagined.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <a id="846593835" class="brl-location"></a>In its affirmation of the validity of the great religions of the past, the Kitáb-i-Aqdas
                     reiterates those eternal truths enunciated by all the Divine Messengers: the unity
                     of God, love of one’s neighbor, and the moral purpose of earthly life. At the same
                     time it removes those elements of past religious codes that now constitute obstacles
                     to the emerging unification of the world and the reconstruction of human society.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <a id="291384452" class="brl-location"></a>The Law of God for this Dispensation addresses the needs of the entire human family.
                     There are laws in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas which are directed primarily to the members of
                     a specific section of humanity and can be immediately understood by them but which,
                     at first reading, may be obscure to people of a different culture. Such, for example,
                     is the law prohibiting the confession of sins to a fellow human being which, though
                     understandable by those of Christian background, may puzzle others. Many laws relate
                     to those of past Dispensations, especially the two most recent ones, those of Muḥammad
                     and the Báb embodied in the Qur’án and the Bayán. Nevertheless, although certain ordinances
                     of the Aqdas have such a focused reference, they also have universal implications.
                     Through His Law, Bahá’u’lláh gradually unveils the significance of the new levels
                     of knowledge and behavior to which the peoples of the world are being called. He embeds
                     His precepts in a setting of spiritual commentary, keeping ever before the mind of
                     the reader the principle that these laws, no matter the subject with which they deal,
                     serve the manifold purposes of bringing tranquillity to human society, raising the
                     standard of human behavior, increasing the range of human understanding, and spiritualizing
                     the life of each and all. Throughout, it is the relationship of the individual soul
                     to God and the fulfillment of its spiritual destiny that is  the ultimate aim of the
                     laws of religion. <span class="brl-italic">“Think not,”</span> is Bahá’u’lláh’s own assertion, <span class="brl-italic">“that We have revealed unto you a mere code of laws. Nay, rather, We have unsealed
                        the choice Wine with the fingers of might and power.”</span> His Book of Laws is His <span class="brl-italic">“weightiest testimony unto all people, and the proof of the All-Merciful unto all
                        who are in heaven and all who are on earth.”</span>

                     <a id="981811850" class="brl-location"></a>An introduction to the spiritual universe unveiled in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas would fail
                     in its purpose if it did not acquaint the reader with the interpretive and legislative
                     institutions that Bahá’u’lláh has indissolubly linked with the system of law thus
                     revealed. At the foundation of this guidance lies the unique role which Bahá’u’lláh’s
                     Writings—indeed the text of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas itself—confer on His eldest son, ‘Abdu’l‑Bahá.
                     This unique figure is at once the Exemplar of the pattern of life taught by His Father,
                     the divinely inspired authoritative Interpreter of His Teachings and the Center and
                     Pivot of the Covenant which the Author of the Bahá’í Revelation made with all who
                     recognize Him. The twenty-nine years of ‘Abdu’l‑Bahá’s ministry endowed the Bahá’í
                     world with a luminous body of commentary that opens multiple vistas of understanding
                     on His Father’s purpose.

                     <a id="455239592" class="brl-location"></a>In His Will and Testament ‘Abdu’l‑Bahá conferred the mantle of Guardian of the Cause
                     and infallible Interpreter of its teachings upon His eldest grandson, Shoghi Effendi,
                     and confirmed the authority and guarantee of divine guidance decreed by Bahá’u’lláh
                     for the Universal House of Justice on all matters <span class="brl-italic">“which have not outwardly been revealed in the Book.”</span> The Guardianship and the Universal House of Justice can thus be seen to be, in the
                     words of Shoghi Effendi, the <span>“Twin Successors”</span> of Bahá’u’lláh and ‘Abdu’l‑Bahá. They are the supreme institutions of the Administrative
                     Order which was founded and anticipated in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas and elaborated by ‘Abdu’l‑Bahá
                     in His Will.

                     <a id="115535811" class="brl-location"></a>During the thirty-six years of his ministry, Shoghi Effendi raised up the structure
                     of elected Spiritual Assemblies—the Houses of Justice referred to in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas,
                     now in their embryonic stage—and with their collaboration initiated the systematic
                     implementation of the Divine Plan that ‘Abdu’l‑Bahá had laid out for the diffusion
                     of the Faith throughout the world. He also set in motion, on the basis of the strong
                     administrative structure that had been established, the processes which were an essential
                     preparation for the election of the Universal House of Justice. This body, which came
                     into existence in April 1963, is elected through secret ballot and plurality vote
                     in a three-stage election by adult Bahá’ís throughout the world. The revealed Word
                     of Bahá’u’lláh, together with the interpretations and expositions of the Center of
                     the Covenant and the Guardian of the Cause, constitute the binding terms of reference
                     of the Universal House of Justice and are its bedrock foundation.

                     <a id="375457678" class="brl-location"></a>As to the laws themselves, a careful scrutiny discloses that they govern three areas:
                     the individual’s relationship to God, physical and spiritual matters which benefit
                     the individual directly, and relations among individuals and between the individual
                     and society. They can be grouped under the following headings: prayer and fasting;
                     laws of personal status governing marriage, divorce and inheritance; a range of other
                     laws, ordinances and prohibitions, as well as exhortations; and the abrogation of
                     specific laws and ordinances of previous Dispensations. A salient characteristic is
                     their brevity. They constitute the kernel of a vast range of law that will arise in
                     centuries to come. This elaboration of the law will be enacted by the Universal House
                     of Justice under the authority conferred upon it by Bahá’u’lláh Himself. In one of
                     His Tablets ‘Abdu’l‑Bahá elucidates this principle:
                  </p>
                  <blockquote class="brl-italic brl-margin-2 brl-btmmargin brl-topmargin">

                        <a id="674478087" class="brl-location"></a>Those matters of major importance which constitute the foundation of the Law of God
                        are explicitly recorded in the Text, but subsidiary laws are left to the House of
                        Justice. The wisdom of this is that the times never remain the same, for  change is
                        a necessary quality and an essential attribute of this world, and of time and place.
                        Therefore the House of Justice will take action accordingly…
                     </p>

                        <a id="098703682" class="brl-location"></a>Briefly, this is the wisdom of referring the laws of society to the House of Justice.
                        In the religion of Islám, similarly, not every ordinance was explicitly revealed;
                        nay not a tenth part of a tenth part was included in the Text; although all matters
                        of major importance were specifically referred to, there were undoubtedly thousands
                        of laws which were unspecified. These were devised by the divines of a later age according
                        to the laws of Islamic jurisprudence, and individual divines made conflicting deductions
                        from the original revealed ordinances. All these were enforced. Today this process
                        of deduction is the right of the body of the House of Justice, and the deductions
                        and conclusions of individual learned men have no authority, unless they are endorsed
                        by the House of Justice. The difference is precisely this, that from the conclusions
                        and endorsements of the body of the House of Justice whose members are elected by
                        and known to the worldwide Bahá’í community, no differences will arise; whereas the
                        conclusions of individual divines and scholars would definitely lead to differences,
                        and result in schism, division, and dispersion. The oneness of the Word would be destroyed,
                        the unity of the Faith would disappear, and the edifice of the Faith of God would
                        be shaken.

                     <a id="898428560" class="brl-location"></a>The number of laws binding on Bahá’ís is not increased by the publication of this
                     translation. When it is deemed timely, the Bahá’í community will be advised which

                  <p>
                     <a id="774789772" class="brl-location"></a>In general, the laws of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas are stated succinctly. An example of this
                     conciseness can be seen in the fact that many are expressed only as they apply to
                     a man, but it is apparent from the Guardian’s writings that, where Bahá’u’lláh has
                     given a law as between a man and a woman, it applies <span class="brl-italic">mutatis mutandis</span> between a woman and a man unless the context makes this impossible. For example,
                     the text of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas forbids a man to marry his father’s wife (i.e. his stepmother),
                     and the Guardian has indicated that likewise a woman is forbidden to marry her stepfather.
                     This understanding of the implications of the Law has far-reaching effects in light
                     of the fundamental Bahá’í principle of the equality of the sexes, and should be borne
                     in mind when the sacred Text is studied. That men and women differ from one another
                     in certain characteristics and functions is an inescapable fact of nature and makes
                     possible their complementary roles in certain areas of the life of society; but it
                     is significant that ‘Abdu’l‑Bahá has stated that in this Dispensation <span class="brl-italic">“Equality of men and women, except in some negligible instances, has been fully and
                        categorically announced.”</span>

                     <a id="954603619" class="brl-location"></a>Mention has already been made of the intimate relationship between the Kitáb-i-Aqdas
                     and the Holy Books of previous Dispensations. Especially close is the relationship
                     to the Bayán, the Book of Laws revealed by the Báb. It is elucidated in the following
                     excerpts from letters written on behalf of the Guardian:

                        <a id="511712558" class="brl-location"></a>Shoghi Effendi feels that the unity of the Bahá’í Revelation as one complete whole
                        embracing the Faith of the Báb should be emphasized… The Faith of the Báb should not
                        be divorced from that of Bahá’u’lláh. Though the teachings of the Bayán have been
                        abrogated and superseded by the laws of the Aqdas, yet due to the fact that the Báb
                        considered Himself as the Forerunner of Bahá’u’lláh, we would regard His Dispensation
                        together with that of Bahá’u’lláh as forming one entity, the former being introductory
                        to the advent of the latter.
                     </p>

                        <a id="468025770" class="brl-location"></a>The Báb states that His laws are provisional and depend upon the acceptance of the
                        future Manifestation. This is why in the Book of Aqdas Bahá’u’lláh sanctions some
                        of the laws found in the Bayán, modifies others and sets aside many.

                     that even after its revelation the Aqdas was withheld by Him for some time before
                     it was sent to the friends in Iran. Thereafter, as Shoghi Effendi has related:

                        precepts and principles which lie at the very core of His Faith, by the reaffirmation
                        of truths He had previously proclaimed, by the elaboration and elucidation of some
                        of the laws He had already laid down, by the revelation of further prophecies and

                        the provisions  of His Most Holy Book. These were recorded in unnumbered Tablets,

                     to use it in those Tablets and other Writings where its precision of meaning was particularly
                     appropriate to the exposition of basic principle. Beyond the choice of language itself,
                     however, the style employed is of an exalted and emotive character, immensely compelling,
                     particularly to those familiar with the great literary tradition out of which it arose.
                     In taking up his task of translation, Shoghi Effendi faced the challenge of finding
                     an English style which would not only faithfully convey the exactness of the text’s
                     meaning, but would also evoke in the reader the spirit of meditative reverence which
                     is a distinguishing feature of response to the original. The form of expression he
                     selected, reminiscent of the style used by the seventeenth-century translators of
                     the Bible, captures the elevated mode of Bahá’u’lláh’s Arabic, while remaining accessible
                     to the contemporary reader. His translations, moreover, are illumined by his uniquely
                     inspired understanding of the purport and implications of the originals.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <a id="204424350" class="brl-location"></a>Although both Arabic and English are languages with rich vocabularies and varied modes
                     of expression, their forms differ widely from one another. The Arabic of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas
                     is marked by intense concentration and terseness of expression. It is a characteristic
                     of this style that if a connotation is obvious it should not be explicitly stated.
                     This presents a problem for a reader whose cultural, religious and literary background
                     is entirely different from that of Arabic. A literal translation of a passage which
                     is clear in the Arabic could be obscure in English. It therefore becomes necessary
                     to include in the English translation of such passages that element of the Arabic
                     sentence which is obviously implicit in the original. At the same time, it is vital
                     to avoid extrapolating this process to the point where it would add unjustifiably
                     to the original or limit its meaning. Striking the right balance between beauty and
                     clarity of expression on the one hand, and literalness on the other, is one of the
                     major issues with which the translators have had to grapple and which has caused repeated
                     reconsideration of the rendering of certain passages. Another major issue is the legal
                     implication of certain Arabic terms which have a range of meanings different from
                     those of similar terms in English.

                     <a id="054844281" class="brl-location"></a>Sacred Scripture clearly requires especial care and faithfulness in translation. This
                     is supremely important in the case of a Book of Laws, where it is vital that the reader
                     not be misled or drawn into fruitless disputation. As had been foreseen, the translation
                     of the Most Holy Book has been a work of the utmost difficulty, requiring consultation
                     with experts in many lands. Since some one-third of the text had already been translated
                     by Shoghi Effendi, it was necessary to strive for three qualities in the translation
                     of the remaining passages: accuracy of meaning, beauty of English, and conformity
                     of style with that used by Shoghi Effendi.

                     <a id="824896321" class="brl-location"></a>We are now satisfied that the translation has reached a point where it represents
                     an acceptable rendering of the original. Nevertheless, it will undoubtedly give rise
                     to questions and suggestions which may shed further light on its content. We are profoundly
                     grateful for the assiduous and meticulous labors of the members of the Committees
                     whom we commissioned to prepare and review this translation of the Aqdas and to compose
                     the annotations. We are confident that this first authorized English edition of the
                     Kitáb-i-Aqdas will enable its readers to obtain at least an inkling of the splendor
                     of the Mother Book of the Bahá’í Dispensation.

                     <a id="542763832" class="brl-location"></a>Our world has entered the dark heart of an age of fundamental change beyond anything
                     in all of its tumultuous history. Its peoples, of whatever race, nation, or religion,
                     are being challenged to subordinate all lesser loyalties and limiting identities to
                     their oneness as citizens of a single planetary homeland. In Bahá’u’lláh’s words:
                     <span class="brl-italic">“the well-being of mankind, its peace and security, are unattainable unless and until
                        its unity is firmly established.”</span> May the publication of this translation of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas lend a fresh impulse
                     to the realization of this universal vision, opening vistas of a worldwide regeneration.

                     still mightier revelation of the creative power of its Author, and to what may well
                     rank as the most signal act of His ministry—the promulgation of the Kitáb-i-Aqdas.
                     Alluded to in the Kitáb-i-Íqán, the principal repository of that Law which the Prophet
                     Isaiah had anticipated, and which the writer of the Apocalypse had described as the
                     <span class="brl-italic">“new heaven”</span> and the <span class="brl-italic">“new earth,”</span> as <span class="brl-italic">“the Tabernacle of God,”</span> as the <span class="brl-italic">“Holy City,”</span> as the <span class="brl-italic">“Bride,”</span> the <span class="brl-italic">“New Jerusalem coming down from God,”</span> this <span class="brl-italic">“Most Holy Book,”</span> whose provisions must remain inviolate for no less than a thousand years, and whose
                     system will embrace the entire planet, may well be regarded as the brightest emanation
                     of the mind of Bahá’u’lláh, as the Mother Book of His Dispensation, and the Charter
                     of His New World Order.

                     had afflicted Him, through the acts committed by His enemies and the professed adherents
                     of His Faith, this Book, this treasury enshrining the priceless gems of His Revelation,
                     stands out, by virtue of the principles it inculcates, the administrative  institutions
                     it ordains and the function with which it invests the appointed Successor of its Author,
                     unique and incomparable among the world’s sacred Scriptures. For, unlike the Old Testament
                     and the Holy Books which preceded it, in which the actual precepts uttered by the
                     Prophet Himself are nonexistent; unlike the Gospels, in which the few sayings attributed
                     to Jesus Christ afford no clear guidance regarding the future administration of the
                     affairs of His Faith; unlike even the Qur’án which, though explicit in the laws and
                     ordinances formulated by the Apostle of God, is silent on the all-important subject
                     of the succession, the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, revealed from first to last by the Author of
                     the Dispensation Himself, not only preserves for posterity the basic laws and ordinances
                     on which the fabric of His future World Order must rest, but ordains, in addition
                     to the function of interpretation which it confers upon His Successor, the necessary
                     institutions through which the integrity and unity of His Faith can alone be safeguarded.

                     the promulgation of the <span class="brl-italic">“Most Great Law”</span>; pronounces them to be His vassals; proclaims Himself the <span class="brl-italic">“King of Kings”</span>; disclaims any intention of laying hands on their kingdoms; reserves for Himself

                     is the <span class="brl-italic">“Unerring Balance”</span> established amongst men. In it He formally ordains the institution of the <span class="brl-italic">“House of Justice,”</span> defines its functions, fixes its revenues, and designates its members as the <span class="brl-italic">“Men of Justice,”</span> the <span class="brl-italic">“Deputies of God,”</span> the <span class="brl-italic">“Trustees of the All-Merciful”</span>; alludes to the future Center of His Covenant, and invests Him with the right of
                     interpreting His holy Writ; anticipates by implication the  institution of Guardianship;
                     bears witness to the revolutionizing effect of His World Order; enunciates the doctrine
                     of the <span class="brl-italic">“Most Great Infallibility”</span> of the Manifestation of God; asserts this infallibility to be the inherent and exclusive
                     right of the Prophet; and rules out the possibility of the appearance of another Manifestation

                     condemns cruelty to animals, idleness and sloth, backbiting and calumny; censures
                     divorce; interdicts gambling, the use of opium, wine and other intoxicating drinks;
                     specifies the punishments for murder, arson, adultery and theft; stresses the importance
                     of marriage and lays down its essential conditions; imposes the obligation of engaging
                     in some trade or profession, exalting such occupation to the rank of worship; emphasizes
                     the necessity of providing the means for the education of children; and lays upon
                     every person the duty of writing a testament and of strict obedience to one’s government.

                     them to guard against fanaticism, sedition, pride, dispute and contention; inculcates
                     upon them immaculate cleanliness, strict truthfulness, spotless chastity, trustworthiness,

                     aid. He, furthermore, dwells upon the instability of human affairs; declares that
                     true liberty consists in man’s submission to His commandments; cautions them not to
                     be indulgent in carrying out His statutes; prescribes the twin inseparable duties
                     of recognizing the <span class="brl-italic">“Dayspring of God’s Revelation”</span> and of observing all the ordinances revealed by Him, neither of which, He affirms,

                        <span class="brl-uppercase">The</span> first duty prescribed by God for His servants is the recognition of Him Who is the
                        Dayspring of His Revelation and the Fountain of His laws, Who representeth the Godhead
                        in both the Kingdom of His Cause and the world of creation. Whoso achieveth this duty
                        hath attained unto all good; and whoso is deprived thereof hath gone astray, though
                        he be the author of every righteous deed. It behooveth everyone who reacheth this
                        most sublime station, this summit of transcendent glory, to observe every ordinance
                        of Him Who is the Desire of the world. These twin duties are inseparable. Neither
                        is acceptable without the other. Thus hath it been decreed by Him Who is the Source
                        of Divine inspiration.

                        and the security of its peoples. He that turneth away from them is accounted among
                        the abject and foolish. We, verily, have commanded you to refuse the dictates of your
                        evil passions and corrupt  desires, and not to transgress the bounds which the Pen
                        of the Most High hath fixed, for these are the breath of life unto all created things.
                        The seas of Divine wisdom and Divine utterance have risen under the breath of the
                        breeze of the All-Merciful. Hasten to drink your fill, O men of understanding! They
                        that have violated the Covenant of God by breaking His commandments, and have turned
                        back on their heels, these have erred grievously in the sight of God, the All-Possessing,
                        the Most High.

                        hath it been sent down from the heaven of the Will of your Lord, the Lord of Revelation.
                        Were any man to taste the sweetness of the words which the lips of the All-Merciful
                        have willed to utter, he would, though the treasures of the earth be in his possession,
                        renounce them one and all, that he might vindicate the truth of even one of His commandments,
                        shining above the Dayspring of His bountiful care and loving-kindness.

                        addressed to My creation these words: “Observe My commandments, for the love of My

                        from these words, laden with the perfume of a grace which no tongue can  describe.
                        By My life! He who hath drunk the choice wine of fairness from the hands of My bountiful
                        favor will circle around My commandments that shine above the Dayspring of My creation.

                        asunder. He doeth what He pleaseth. He chooseth, and none  may question His choice.
                        Whatsoever He, the Well-Beloved, ordaineth, the same is, verily, beloved. To this
                        He Who is the Lord of all creation beareth Me witness. Whoso hath inhaled the sweet

                        with his own eyes the shafts of the enemy, that he may establish the truth of the

                        and Bounty.” Whoso is unable to do this, let him say only “Glorified be God”; this
                        shall assuredly suffice him. He is, of a truth, the all-sufficing, the ever-abiding,
                        the forgiving, compassionate God. <span>Upon completing your prostrations, seat yourselves cross-legged</span>—men and women alike—and eighteen times repeat “Glorified be God, the Lord of the

                        guidance, ways that lead to one way, which is this Straight Path. Render thanks unto

Thus hath the Daystar of Utterance shone forth above the horizon of the Book as

                        behooveth the people of Bahá, throughout these days, to provide good cheer for themselves,
                        their kindred and, beyond them, the poor and needy, and with joy and exultation to
                        hail and glorify their Lord, to sing His praise and magnify His Name; and when they
                        end—<span>these days of giving that precede the season of restraint</span>—let them enter upon the Fast. Thus hath it been ordained by Him Who is the Lord of

                        upon high hills and lofty peaks, to leave no rock or tree, no clod of earth, but was
                        a witness to his worship—yet, should the fragrance of My good pleasure not be inhaled
                        from him, his works would never be acceptable unto God. Thus hath it been decreed

                        him to retract and repudiate such claim. Should he repent, God will, no doubt, forgive
                        him. If, however, he persisteth in his error, God will, assuredly, send down one who
                        will deal mercilessly with him. Terrible, indeed, is God in punishing! Whosoever interpreteth

                        will possess them. Thus warneth you He Who is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. Say:
                        Can ye claim that what ye own is lasting or secure? Nay! By Myself, the All-Merciful,
                        ye cannot, if ye be of them who judge fairly. The days of your life flee away as a
                        breath of wind, and all your pomp and glory shall be folded up as were the pomp and
                        glory of those gone before you. Reflect, O people! What hath become of your bygone
                        days, your lost  centuries? Happy the days that have been consecrated to the remembrance
                        of God, and blessed the hours which have been spent in praise of Him Who is the All-Wise.
                        By My life! Neither the pomp of the mighty, nor the wealth of the rich, nor even the
                        ascendancy of the ungodly will endure. All will perish, at a word from Him. He, verily,
                        is the All-Powerful, the All-Compelling, the Almighty. What advantage is there in
                        the earthly things which men possess? That which shall profit them, they have utterly
                        neglected. Erelong, they will awake from their slumber, and find themselves unable
                        to obtain that which hath escaped them in the days of their Lord, the Almighty, the
                        All-Praised. Did they but know it, they would renounce their all, that their names
                        may be mentioned before His throne. They, verily, are accounted among the dead.

                        shall be numbered by the Pen of His behest  among the righteous; otherwise, if there
                        be good reason for delay, he must inform his wife and make the utmost endeavor to
                        return to her. Should neither of these eventualities occur, <span>it behooveth her to wait for a period of nine months, after which there is no impediment
                           to her taking another husband</span>; but should she wait longer, God, verily, loveth those women and men who show forth
                        patience. Obey ye My commandments, and follow not the ungodly, they who have been
                        reckoned as sinners in God’s Holy Tablet. If, during the period of her waiting, word
                        should reach her from her husband, <span>she should choose the course that is praiseworthy</span>. He, of a truth, desireth that His servants and His handmaids should be at peace

                        you. Thus hath the decree been fixed and the promise come to pass. If, however, news
                        should reach her of her husband’s death or murder, and be confirmed by general report,
                        or by the testimony of <span>two just witnesses</span>, it behooveth her to remain single; then, upon completion of the fixed number of
                        months, she is free to adopt the course of her choosing. Such is the bidding of Him
                        Who is mighty and powerful in His command.

                        the completion of this period, their love hath not returned, it is permissible for
                        divorce to take place. God’s wisdom, verily, hath  encompassed all things. <span>The Lord hath prohibited, in a Tablet inscribed by the Pen of His command, the practice
                           to which ye formerly had recourse when thrice ye had divorced a woman.</span> This He hath done as a favor on His part, that ye may be accounted among the thankful.
                        <span>He who hath divorced his wife may choose, upon the passing of each month, to remarry
                           her when there is mutual affection and consent, so long as she hath not taken another
                           husband. Should she have wed again, then, by this other union, the separation is confirmed
                           and the matter is concluded unless, clearly, her circumstances change.</span> Thus hath the decree been inscribed with majesty in this glorious Tablet by Him Who
                        is the Dawning-place of Beauty.

                        of so great a bounty. This We have commanded you, though We are well able to dispense
                        with you and with all who are in the heavens and on earth; in it there are benefits
                        and wisdoms beyond the ken of anyone but God, the Omniscient, the All-Informed. Say:
                        By this means He hath desired to purify what ye possess and to enable you to draw
                        nigh unto such stations as none can comprehend save those whom God hath willed. He,
                        in truth, is the Beneficent, the Gracious, the Bountiful. O people! Deal not faithlessly
                        with the Right of God, nor, without His leave, make free with its disposal. Thus hath
                        His commandment been established in the holy Tablets, and in this exalted Book. He
                        who dealeth faithlessly with God shall in justice meet with faithlessness himself;
                        he, however, who acteth in accordance with God’s bidding shall receive a blessing
                        from the heaven of the bounty of his Lord, the Gracious, the Bestower, the Generous,
                        the Ancient of Days. He, verily, hath willed for you that which is yet beyond your
                        knowledge, but which shall be known to you when, after this fleeting life, your souls
                        soar heavenwards and the trappings of your earthly joys are folded up. Thus admonisheth
                        you He in Whose possession is the Guarded Tablet.

                        We find some men desiring liberty, and priding themselves therein. Such men are in
                        the depths of ignorance.

                        and its symbol is the animal. That which beseemeth man is submission unto such restraints
                        as will protect him from his own ignorance, and guard him against the harm of the
                        mischief maker. Liberty causeth man to overstep the bounds of propriety, and to infringe
                        on the dignity of his station. It debaseth him to the level of extreme depravity and
                        wickedness.

                        over all things.” These are the verses that were revealed aforetime, but lo, <span>the Point of the Bayán</span> now calleth out, exclaiming, “O Best-Beloved of the worlds! Reveal Thou in their
                        stead such words as will waft the fragrance of Thy gracious favors over all mankind.
                        We have announced unto everyone that one single word from Thee excelleth all that
                        hath been sent down in the Bayán. Thou, indeed, hast power to do what pleaseth Thee.

                        Burn ye away the veils with the fire of My love, and dispel ye the mists of vain imaginings

                        the Lord, aforetime and hereafter; beware lest ye choose instead the part of ignominy
                        and abasement. Naught shall avail you in this Day but God, nor is there any refuge
                        to flee to save Him, the Omniscient, the All-Wise. Whoso hath known Me hath known
                        the Goal of all desire, and whoso hath turned unto Me hath turned unto the Object
                        of all adoration. Thus hath it been set forth in the Book, and thus hath it been decreed
                        by God, the Lord of all worlds. To read but one of the verses of My Revelation is
                        better than to peruse the Scriptures of both the former and latter generations. This
                        is the Utterance of the All-Merciful, would that ye had ears to hear! Say: This is
                        the essence of knowledge, did ye but understand.

                        <a id="382178230" class="brl-location"></a>And now consider what hath been revealed in yet another passage, that perchance ye
                        may forsake your own concepts and set your faces towards God, the Lord of being. He<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#631054958">4</a></sup> hath said: “<span>It is unlawful to enter into marriage save with a believer in the Bayán. Should only
                           one party to a marriage embrace this Cause, his or her possessions will become unlawful
                           to the other</span>, until such time as the latter hath converted. This law,  however, will only take
                        effect after the exaltation of the Cause of Him Whom We shall manifest in truth, or
                        of that which hath already been made manifest in justice. Ere this, ye are at liberty
                        to enter into wedlock as ye wish, that haply by this means ye may exalt the Cause
                        of God.” Thus hath the Nightingale sung with sweet melody upon the celestial bough,
                        in praise of its Lord, the All-Merciful. Well is it with them that hearken.

                        truth, and not to be of those who see the testimony of God yet reject and deny it.
                        They, in truth, are of those who will assuredly perish. <span>The Point of the Bayán</span> hath explicitly made mention in this verse of the exaltation of My Cause before His
                        own Cause; unto this will testify every just and understanding mind. As ye can readily
                        witness in this day, its exaltation is such as none can deny save those whose eyes
                        are drunken in this mortal life and whom a humiliating chastisement awaiteth in the
                        life to come.

                        many an exponent of wisdom have We in all justice consigned to the fire. We are, in

                        the name of the Lord of all men, and be not of the deceitful. Should ye turn unto

                        in setting down what he conceived to be the laws and ordinances of God, yet when He
                        Who is the Unconstrained appeared, not one letter thereof availed him, or he would

                        <span>O people of the Bayán!</span> We, verily, set foot within the School of God when ye lay slumbering; and We perused
                        the Tablet while ye were fast asleep. By the one true God! We read the Tablet ere
                        it was revealed, while ye were unaware, and We had perfect knowledge of the Book when
                        ye were yet unborn. These words are to your measure, not to God’s. To this testifieth
                        that which is enshrined within His knowledge, if ye be of them that comprehend; and
                        to this the tongue of the Almighty doth bear witness, if ye be of those who understand.
                        I swear by God, were We to lift the veil, ye would be dumbfounded. 
                     </p>

                        <a id="102223758" class="brl-location"></a>Take heed that ye dispute not idly concerning the Almighty and His Cause, for lo!
                        He hath appeared amongst you invested with a Revelation so great as to encompass all
                        things, whether of the past or of the future. Were We to address Our theme by speaking
                        in the language of the inmates of the Kingdom, We would say: “In truth, God created
                        that School ere He created heaven and earth, and We entered it before <span>the letters B and E were joined and knit together</span>.” Such is the language of Our servants in Our Kingdom; consider what the tongue of
                        the dwellers of Our exalted Dominion would utter, for We have taught them Our knowledge
                        and have revealed to them whatever had lain hidden in God’s wisdom. Imagine then what
                        the Tongue of Might and Grandeur would utter in His All-Glorious Abode!

                        a field for the foolish and faint of heart. By God, this is the arena of insight and
                        detachment, of vision and upliftment, where none may spur on their chargers save the
                        valiant horsemen of the Merciful, who have severed all attachment to the world of
                        being. These, truly, are they that render God victorious on earth, and are the dawning-places
                        of His sovereign might amidst mankind.

                        the Most Compassionate. God is My witness that the Bayán was sent down for no other
                        purpose than to celebrate My praise, did ye but know! In it the pure in heart will
                        find  only the fragrance of My love, only My Name that overshadoweth all that seeth
                        and is seen. Say: Turn ye, O people, unto that which hath proceeded from My Most Exalted
                        Pen. Should ye inhale therefrom the fragrance of God, set not yourselves against Him,
                        nor deny yourselves a portion of His gracious favor and His manifold bestowals. Thus
                        doth your Lord admonish you; He, verily, is the Counselor, the Omniscient.

                        of thy Lord, and <span>remember how We nurtured thee by day and by night for service to the Cause</span>. Fear God, and be thou of the truly repentant. Granted that the people were confused
                        about thy station, is it conceivable that thou thyself art similarly confused? Tremble
                        before thy Lord and recall the days when thou didst stand before Our throne, and didst
                        write down the verses that We dictated unto thee—verses sent down by God, the Omnipotent
                        Protector, the Lord of might and power. Beware lest  the fire of thy presumptuousness
                        debar thee from attaining to God’s Holy Court. Turn unto Him, and fear not because

                        no God is there but Him, the Ever-Forgiving, the All-Bounteous. We admonish thee solely
                        for the sake of God. Shouldst thou accept this counsel, thou wilt have acted to thine
                        own behoof; and shouldst thou reject it, thy Lord, verily, can well dispense with
                        thee, and with all those who, in manifest delusion, have followed thee. Behold! <span>God hath laid hold on him who led thee astray.</span> Return unto God, humble, submissive and lowly; verily, He will put away from thee
                        thy sins, for thy Lord, of a certainty, is the Forgiving, the Mighty, the All-Merciful.

                           They, in truth, are the Trustees of God among His servants and the daysprings of authority

                           Inasmuch as for each day there is a new problem and for every problem an expedient
                           solution, such affairs should be referred to the House of Justice that the members

                           and act in accordance with that which God desireth. Ye are all the leaves of one tree
                           and the drops of one ocean.

                        <span class="brl-italic">Answer:</span> According to the Book of God, the estate of the deceased is divided into 2,520 shares,
                        which number is the lowest common multiple of all integers up to nine, and these shares
                        are then distributed into seven portions, each of which is allocated, as mentioned
                        in the Book, to a particular category of heirs. The children, for example, are allotted
                        nine blocks of 60 shares, comprising 540 shares in all. The meaning of the statement
                        “We doubled their share” is thus that the children receive a further nine blocks of
                        60 shares, entitling them to a total of 18 blocks all told. The extra shares that
                        they receive are deducted from the portions of the other categories  of heirs, so
                        that, although it is revealed, for instance, that the spouse is entitled to “eight
                        parts comprising four hundred and eighty shares,” which is the equivalent of eight
                        blocks of 60 shares, now, by virtue of this rearrangement, one and a half blocks of
                        shares, comprising 90 shares in all, have been subtracted from the spouse’s portion
                        and reallocated to the children, and similarly in the case of the others. The result
                        is that the total amount subtracted is equivalent to the nine extra blocks of shares
                        allotted to the children.

                        <span class="brl-italic">Answer:</span> The sacred verse sufficeth. He saith, exalted be His Word: “Should the deceased leave
                        no offspring, their share shall revert to the House of Justice” etc. and “Should the
                        deceased leave offspring, but none of the other categories of heirs that have been
                        specified in the Book, they shall receive two-thirds of the inheritance and the remaining
                        third shall revert to the House of Justice” etc. In other words, where there are no
                        offspring, their allotted portion of the inheritance reverteth to the House of Justice;
                        and where there are offspring but the other categories of heirs are lacking, two-thirds
                        of the inheritance pass to the offspring, the remaining third reverting to the House
                        of Justice. This ruling hath both general and specific application, which is to say
                        that whenever any category of this latter class of heirs is absent, two-thirds of
                        their inheritance pass to the offspring and the remaining third to the House of Justice.

                        <span class="brl-italic">Answer:</span> The basic sum on which Ḥuqúqu’lláh is payable is nineteen mi<u>th</u>qáls of gold. In other words, when money to the value of this sum hath been acquired,
                        a payment of Ḥuqúq falleth due. Likewise Ḥuqúq is payable when the value, not the
                        number, of other forms of property reacheth the prescribed amount. Ḥuqúqu’lláh is
                        payable no more than once. A person, for instance, who  acquireth a thousand mi<u>th</u>qáls of gold, and payeth the Ḥuqúq, is not liable to make a further such payment on
                        this sum, but only on what accrueth to it through commerce, business and the like.
                        When this increase, namely the profit realized, reacheth the prescribed sum, one must
                        carry out what God hath decreed. Only when the principal changeth hands is it once
                        more subject to payment of Ḥuqúq, as it was the first time. The Primal Point hath
                        directed that Ḥuqúqu’lláh must be paid on the value of whatsoever one possesseth;
                        yet, in this Most Mighty Dispensation, We have exempted the household furnishings,

                        to him. Otherwise, the finder of the property should wait one year, and if, during
                        this period, the owner cometh to light, the finder should receive from him the crier’s
                        fee and restore to him his property; only if the year should pass without the owner’s
                        being identified may the finder take possession of the property himself. If the value
                        of the property is less than or equal to the crier’s fee, the finder should wait a
                        single day from the time of its discovery, at the end of which, if the owner hath
                        not come to light, he may himself appropriate it; and in the case of property discovered
                        in an uninhabited area, the finder should observe a three days’ wait, on the passing
                        of which period, if the identity of the owner remain unknown, he is free to take possession
                        of his find.

                        <span class="brl-italic">Answer:</span> Many Tablets were revealed and dispatched in their original form without being checked
                        and reviewed. Consequently, as bidden, they were again read out in the Holy Presence,
                        and brought into conformity with the grammatical conventions of the people in order
                        to forestall the cavils of opponents of the Cause. Another reason for this practice
                        is that the new style inaugurated by the Herald, may the souls of all else but Him
                        be offered up for His sake, was seen to be marked by substantial latitude in adherence
                        to the rules of  grammar; sacred verses therefore were then revealed in a style which
                        is for the most part in conformity with current usage for ease of understanding and
                        concision of expression.

                        receive their allotted shares of the inheritance, while a statement of the remainder
                        must be submitted to  the Court of the Most High. In His hand is the source of authority;
                        He ordaineth as He pleaseth. In this regard, a law was revealed in the Land of Mystery,<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#265656869">10</a></sup> temporarily awarding the missing heirs’ inheritance to the existing heirs until such

                        have all been commissioned by the One True God, magnified be His glory, to nurture
                        the trees of human existence with the living waters of uprightness and understanding,
                        that there may appear from them that which God hath deposited within their inmost
                        selves. As may be readily observed, each tree yieldeth a certain fruit, and a barren
                        tree is but fit for fire. The purpose of these Educators, in all they said and taught,
                        was to preserve man’s exalted station. Well is it with him who in the Day of God hath
                        laid fast hold upon His precepts and hath not deviated from His true and fundamental
                        Law. The fruits that best befit the tree of human life are trustworthiness and godliness,
                        truthfulness and sincerity; but greater than all, after recognition of the unity of
                        God, praised and glorified be He, is regard for the rights that are due to one’s parents.
                        This teaching hath been mentioned in all the Books of God, and reaffirmed by the Most
                        Exalted Pen. Consider that which the Merciful Lord hath revealed in the Qur’án, exalted
                        are His words: “Worship ye God, join with Him no peer or likeness; and show forth
                        kindliness and charity towards your parents…” Observe how loving-kindness to one’s
                        parents hath been linked to recognition of the one true God! Happy they who are endued
                        with true wisdom and understanding, who see and perceive, who read and understand,
                        and who observe that which God hath  revealed in the Holy Books of old, and in this
                        incomparable and wondrous Tablet.

                        which Joseph’s garment, brought by his brothers to Jacob, their father, enabled Jacob
                        to identify his beloved long-lost son. The metaphor of the fragrant <span class="brl-italic">“garment”</span> is frequently used in the Bahá’í Writings to refer to the recognition of the Manifestation

                        (see note <a href="#110442832">190</a>). Likewise, Shoghi Effendi draws a parallel between the intense jealousy which the
                        preeminence of ‘Abdu’l‑Bahá had aroused in His half-brother, Mírzá Muḥammad-‘Alí,
                        and the deadly envy “which the superior excellence of Joseph had kindled in the hearts
                        of his brothers.”

                           tradition is to make mention of the stages of God’s concealment and manifestation
                           within the Embodiments of Truth, They who are the Dawning-places of His All-Glorious
                           Being. For example, before the flame of the undying fire is lit and manifest, it existeth
                           by itself within itself in the hidden  identity of the universal Manifestations, and
                           this is the stage of the “Hidden Treasure.” And when the blessed Tree is kindled by
                           itself within itself, and that Divine fire burneth by its essence within its essence,
                           this is the stage of “I wished to be made known.” And when it shineth forth from the
                           Horizon of the universe with infinite Divine Names and Attributes upon the contingent
                           and placeless worlds, this constituteth the emergence of a new and wondrous creation
                           which correspondeth to the stage of “Thus I called creation into being.” And when
                           the sanctified souls rend asunder the veils of all earthly attachments and worldly
                           conditions, and hasten to the stage of gazing on the beauty of the Divine Presence
                           and are honored by recognizing the Manifestation and are able to witness the splendor
                           of God’s Most Great Sign in their hearts, then will the purpose of creation, which
                           is the knowledge of Him Who is the Eternal Truth, become manifest.

                        <a id="892468152" class="brl-location"></a>The Báb introduced a new calendar, known now as the Badí‘ or Bahá’í calendar (see

                        the Báb ordained the month of ‘Alá’ to be the month of fasting, decreed that the day
                        of Naw-Rúz should mark the termination of that period, and designated Naw-Rúz as the
                        Day of God. Bahá’u’lláh confirms the Badí‘ calendar wherein Naw-Rúz is designated
                        as a feast.

                        the Northern Hemisphere, which usually occurs on 21 March. Bahá’u’lláh explains that
                        this feast day is to be celebrated on whatever day the sun passes into the constellation
                        of Aries (i.e. the vernal equinox), even should this occur one minute before sunset
                        (Q&amp;A <a href="#549061163">35</a>). Hence Naw-Rúz could fall on 20, 21, or 22 March, depending on the time of the equinox.

                        of four extra days (five in a leap year). The Báb did not specifically define the
                        place for the intercalary days in the new calendar. The Kitáb-i-Aqdas resolves this
                        question by assigning the <span class="brl-italic">“excess”</span> days a fixed position in the calendar immediately preceding the month of ‘Alá’, the

                        <a id="125349000" class="brl-location"></a>This verse of the Aqdas introduces a lengthy passage in which Bahá’u’lláh elaborates
                        the Bahá’í law of inheritance.  In reading this passage one should bear in mind that
                        the law is formulated with the presumption that the deceased is a man; its provisions
                        apply, <span class="brl-italic">mutatis mutandis</span>, when the deceased is a woman.

                        and teachers) is based on the provisions set out by the Báb in the Bayán. The major
                        features of the Bahá’í laws of inheritance in the case of intestacy are:

                              applies “only to such cases when a Bahá’í dies without leaving a will and when, therefore,
                              his property will have to be divided in accordance with the rules set forth in the

                              of religion, provided however he leaves a will, specifying his wishes.” It is always
                              possible, therefore, for a Bahá’í to provide for his or her non-Bahá’í partner, children
                              or relatives by leaving a will.

                        of the inheritance allocated to the brothers and sisters of the deceased. If the brother
                        or sister is from the same father as the deceased, he or she will inherit his or her
                        full allotted share. If, however, the brother or sister is from another father he
                        or she will inherit only two-thirds of the allotted share, the remaining one-third
                        reverting to the House of Justice (Q&amp;A <a href="#117507063">6</a>). Further, in the case where the deceased has full brothers or full sisters  among
                        his heirs, half-brothers and half-sisters from the mother’s side do not inherit (Q&amp;A

                        of the eldest son, they pass to the second-eldest son, and so on. He explains that
                        this provision is an expression of the law of primogeniture, which has invariably
                        been upheld by the Law of God. In a Tablet to a follower of the Faith in Persia He
                        wrote: <span class="brl-italic">“In all the Divine Dispensations the eldest son hath been given extraordinary distinctions.

                        that if there be more than one residence, the principal and most important one passes
                        to the male offspring. The remaining residences will, together with the other possessions
                        of the deceased, have to be divided among the heirs (Q&amp;A <a href="#251998616">34</a>), and He indicates that in the absence of male offspring, two-thirds of the  principal
                        residence and the personal clothing of the deceased father will revert to the female
                        issue and one-third to the House of Justice (Q&amp;A <a href="#060304780">72</a>). Further, when the deceased is a woman, Bahá’u’lláh states that all her used clothing
                        is to be equally divided amongst her daughters. Her unworn clothing, jewels and property
                        must be divided among her heirs, as well as her used clothing if she leaves no daughter
                        (Q&amp;A <a href="#962589418">37</a>).

                           the statement in the Aqdas to this effect which makes it quite clear that idle people
                           who lack the desire to work can have no place in the new World Order. As a corollary
                           of this principle, Bahá’u’lláh further states that mendicity should not only be discouraged
                           but entirely wiped out from the face of society. It is the duty of those who are in
                           charge of the organization of society to give every individual the opportunity of
                           acquiring the necessary talent in some kind of profession, and also the means of utilizing
                           such a talent, both for its own sake and for the sake of earning the means of his
                           livelihood. Every individual, no matter how handicapped and limited he may be, is
                           under the obligation of engaging in some work or profession, for work, especially
                           when performed in the spirit of service, is according to Bahá’u’lláh a form of worship.
                           It has not only a utilitarian purpose, but has a value in itself, because it draws
                           us nearer to God, and enables us to better grasp His purpose for us in this world.
                           It is obvious, therefore, that the inheritance of wealth cannot make anyone immune
                           from daily work.

                        text of the Aqdas monogamy is in effect enjoined. He elaborates this theme in a number
                        of Tablets, including the following:

                        <a id="549402896" class="brl-location"></a>Polygamy is a very ancient practice among the majority of humanity. The introduction
                        of monogamy has been only gradually accomplished by the Manifestations of God. Jesus,
                        for example, did not prohibit polygamy, but abolished divorce except in the case of
                        fornication; Muḥammad limited the number of wives to four, but making plurality of
                        wives contingent on justice, and reintroducing permission for divorce; Bahá’u’lláh,
                        Who was revealing His Teachings in the milieu of a Muslim society, introduced the
                        question of monogamy gradually in accordance with the principles of wisdom and the
                        progressive unfoldment of His purpose. The fact that He left His followers with an
                        infallible Interpreter of His Writings enabled Him to outwardly permit two wives in
                        the Kitáb-i-Aqdas but uphold a condition that enabled ‘Abdu’l‑Bahá to elucidate later
                        that the intention of the law was to enforce monogamy.

                        thereby unable to fulfill his or her life’s purpose, which is fundamentally spiritual.

                        <a id="730343045" class="brl-location"></a>The dowry is to be paid by the bridegroom to the bride. It is fixed at 19 mi<u>th</u>qáls of pure gold for city dwellers, and 19 mi<u>th</u>qáls of silver for village dwellers (see note <a href="#813624619">94</a>). Bahá’u’lláh indicates that, if, at the time of the wedding, the bridegroom is unable
                        to pay the dowry in full, it is permissible for him to issue a promissory note to
                        the bride (Q&amp;A <a href="#095022704">39</a>).

                        <a id="712765086" class="brl-location"></a>With the Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh many familiar concepts, customs and institutions
                        are redefined and take on new meaning. One of these is the dowry. The institution
                        of dowry is a very ancient practice in many cultures and takes many forms. In some
                        countries it is a payment made by the parents of the bride to the bridegroom; in others
                        it is a payment made by the bridegroom to the parents of the bride, called a “bride-price.”
                        In both such cases the amount is often quite considerable. The law of Bahá’u’lláh
                        abolishes all such variants and converts the dowry into a symbolic act whereby the
                        bridegroom presents a gift of a certain limited value to the bride.

                           <a id="506805283" class="brl-location"></a>The severe laws and injunctions revealed by the Báb can be properly appreciated and
                           understood only when interpreted in the light of His own statements regarding the
                           nature, purpose and character of His own Dispensation. As these statements clearly
                           reveal, the Bábí Dispensation was essentially in the nature of a religious and indeed
                           social revolution, and its duration had therefore to be short, but full of tragic
                           events, of sweeping and drastic reforms. Those drastic measures enforced by the Báb
                           and His followers were taken with the view of undermining the very foundations of
                           <u>Sh</u>í‘ih orthodoxy, and thus paving the way for the coming of Bahá’u’lláh. To assert the
                           independence of the new Dispensation, and to prepare also the ground for the approaching
                           Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh, the Báb had therefore to reveal very severe laws, even
                           though most of them were never enforced. But the mere fact that He revealed them was
                           in itself a proof of the independent character of His Dispensation and was sufficient
                           to create such widespread agitation, and excite such opposition on the part of the
                           clergy that led them to cause His eventual martyrdom.

                        only, as Ḥuqúqu’lláh (Q&amp;A <a href="#580485375">89</a>). Thereafter, whenever one’s income, after all expenses have been paid, increases
                        the value of one’s possessions by the amount of at least nineteen mi<u>th</u>qáls of gold, one is to pay nineteen percent of this increase, and so on for each
                        further increase (Q&amp;A <a href="#491430606">8</a>, <a href="#610532110">90</a>).

                        of the laws of His Dispensation. Even after its revelation the Aqdas was withheld
                        by Him for some time before it was sent to the friends in Persia. This divinely purposed

                        from a study of its Teachings. Individual interpretations based on a person’s understanding

                           Immorality of every sort is really forbidden by Bahá’u’lláh, and homosexual relationships
                           He looks upon as such, besides being against nature. To be afflicted this way is a
                           great burden to a conscientious soul. But through the advice and help of doctors,
                           through a strong and determined effort, and through prayer, a soul can overcome this
                           handicap.

                        explained that the significance of this provision was to show respect for the human

                        <a id="091963763" class="brl-location"></a>In brief, the Bahá’í law for the burial of the dead states that it is forbidden to
                        carry the body for more than one hour’s journey from the place of death; that the
                        body should be wrapped in a shroud of silk or cotton, and on its finger should be
                        placed a ring bearing the inscription <span class="brl-italic">“I came forth from God, and return unto Him, detached from all save Him, holding fast
                           to His Name, the Merciful, the Compassionate”</span>; and that the coffin should be of crystal, stone or hard fine wood. A specific Prayer
                        for the Dead (see note <a href="#977404246">10</a>) is ordained, to be said before interment. As affirmed by ‘Abdu’l‑Bahá and the Guardian,
                        this law precludes cremation of the dead. The formal prayer and the ring are meant
                        to be used for those who have attained the age of maturity, i.e. 15 years of age (Q&amp;A
                        <a href="#921145934">70</a>).

                        <a id="982415656" class="brl-location"></a>With regard to the material from which the coffin is to be made, the spirit of the
                        law is that coffins should be of as durable a material as possible. Hence, the Universal
                        House of Justice has explained that, in addition to the materials specified in the
                        Aqdas, there is no objection to using the hardest wood available or concrete for the
                        casket. For the present, the Bahá’ís are left free to make their own choices in this
                        matter.

                        prohibition of marriage with a non-Bábí and its provision that the property of a husband
                        or wife who embraced the Faith could not lawfully pass to the non-Bábí spouse were
                        explicitly held in abeyance by the Báb, and were subsequently annulled by Bahá’u’lláh
                        before they could come into effect. Bahá’u’lláh, in quoting this law, points to the
                        fact that, in revealing it, the Báb had clearly anticipated the possibility that the
                        Cause of Bahá’u’lláh would rise to prominence before that of the Báb Himself.

                        guide to future generations.” “Designedly severe in the rules and regulations it imposed,”
                        he continues, “revolutionizing in the principles it instilled, calculated to awaken
                        from their age-long torpor the clergy and the people, and to administer a sudden and
                        fatal blow to obsolete and corrupt institutions, it proclaimed, through its drastic
                        provisions, the advent of the anticipated Day, the Day when ‘the Summoner shall summon

                        <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Aḥmad-i-Aḥsá’í (1753–1831), who was the founder of the <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u>í School and the first of the “twin luminaries that heralded the advent of the Faith
                        of the Báb,” prophesied that at the appearance of the Promised One all things would
                        be reversed, the last would be first, the first  last. Bahá’u’lláh in one of His Tablets

                           exalted,”</span> and He recalls that <span class="brl-italic">“in the days of Jesus, it was those who were distinguished for their learning, the
                           men of letters and religion, who denied Him, whilst humble fisherman made haste to

                        Divine Revelation, and has since been alluded to by Bahá’u’lláh in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas
                        in such passages as <span class="brl-italic">‘the mystery of the Great Reversal’</span> and <span class="brl-italic">‘the Sign of the Sovereign.’</span>”

                        <a id="247557925" class="brl-location"></a>The name for the letter “Váv” consists of three letters: Váv, Alif, Váv. According
                        to the abjad reckoning, the numerical value of each of these letters is 6, 1 and 6
                        respectively. Shoghi Effendi in a letter written on his behalf to one of the believers
                        in the East provides an interpretation of this verse of the Aqdas. He states that
                        the <span class="brl-italic">“Upright Alif”</span> refers to the advent of the Báb. The first letter with its value of six, which comes
                        before the Alif, is a symbol of earlier Dispensations and Manifestations which predate
                        the Báb, while the third letter, which also has a numerical value of six, stands for
                        Bahá’u’lláh’s supreme Revelation which was made manifest after the Alif.

                        the Manifestation of God. Followers of each religion have tended to allow their devotion
                        to its Founder to cause them to perceive His Revelation as the final Word of God and
                        to deny the possibility of the appearance of any subsequent Prophet. This has been
                        the case of Judaism, Christianity and Islám. Bahá’u’lláh denies the validity of this
                        concept of finality both in relation to past Dispensations and to His own. With regard
                        to Muslims, He wrote in the Kitáb-i-Íqán that the <span class="brl-italic">“people of the Qur’án … have allowed the words ‘Seal of the Prophets’ to veil their
                           eyes,”</span>
                        <span class="brl-italic">“to obscure their  understanding, and deprive them of the grace of all His manifold
                           bounties!”</span> He affirms that <span class="brl-italic">“this theme hath … been a sore test unto all mankind,”</span> and laments the fate of <span class="brl-italic">“those who, clinging unto these words, have disbelieved in Him Who is their true Revealer.”</span> The Báb refers to this same theme when He warns: <span class="brl-italic">“Let not names shut you out as by a veil from Him Who is their Lord, even the name
                           of Prophet, for such a name is but a creation of His utterance.”</span>

                        <a id="918863518" class="brl-location"></a>Regarded as one of the leading savants and prolific authors of his age, he composed

                        in those times. He actively opposed both the Báb and Bahá’u’lláh, and used his treatises
                        to attack the Báb and His Teachings. In the Kitáb-i-Íqán, Bahá’u’lláh condemns the
                        tone and content of his writings and singles out for criticism one of his works which
                        contains negative allusions to the Báb. Shoghi Effendi describes him as “inordinately
                        ambitious and hypocritical” and describes how he “at the special request of the <u>Sh</u>áh had in a treatise viciously attacked the new Faith and its doctrines.”

                        <a id="861701266" class="brl-location"></a>The Hands of the Cause of God were individuals appointed by Bahá’u’lláh and charged
                        with various duties, especially those of protecting and propagating His Faith. In
                        <em>Memorials of the Faithful</em> ‘Abdu’l‑Bahá referred to other outstanding believers as Hands of the Cause, and in
                        His Will and Testament He included a provision calling upon the Guardian of the Faith
                        to appoint Hands of the Cause at his discretion. Shoghi Effendi first raised posthumously
                        a number of the believers to the rank of Hands of the Cause, and during the latter
                        years of his life appointed a total of 32 believers from all continents to this position.
                        In the period between the passing of Shoghi Effendi in 1957 and the  election of the
                        Universal House of Justice in 1963, the Hands of the Cause directed the affairs of
                        the Faith in their capacity as Chief Stewards of Bahá’u’lláh’s embryonic World Commonwealth
                        (see note <a href="#082983936">67</a>). In November 1964, the Universal House of Justice determined that it could not legislate
                        to make it possible to appoint Hands of the Cause. Instead, by a decision of the House
                        of Justice in 1968, the functions of the Hands of the Cause in relation to protecting
                        and propagating the Faith were extended into the future by the creation of the Continental
                        Boards of Counselors, and in 1973 through the establishment of the International Teaching
                        Center, which has its seat in the Holy Land.

                        manner. This word has been used in the Qur’án as God’s bidding calling creation into

                        its organic institutions, begin to function with efficiency and vigor, assert its

                        younger half-brother of Bahá’u’lláh, who arose against Him and opposed His Cause.
                        Mírzá Yaḥyá was nominated by the Báb to serve as a figurehead for the Bábí community
                        pending the imminent manifestation of the Promised One. At the instigation of Siyyid
                        Muḥammad-i-Iṣfahání (see note <a href="#939903762">192</a>), Mírzá Yaḥyá betrayed the trust of the Báb, claimed to be His successor, and intrigued
                        against Bahá’u’lláh, even attempting to have Him murdered. When Bahá’u’lláh formally
                        declared His Mission to him in Adrianople, Mírzá Yaḥyá responded by going to the length
                        of putting forward his own claim to be the recipient of an independent Revelation.
                        His pretensions were eventually rejected by all but a few, who became known as Azalís
                        (see note <a href="#654611060">177</a>). He is described by Shoghi  Effendi as the “Arch-Breaker of the Covenant of the
                        Báb” (see <em>God Passes By,</em> chapter X).

                        personal ambition who induced Mírzá Yaḥyá to oppose Bahá’u’lláh and to claim prophethood
                        for himself (see note <a href="#110442832">190</a>). Although he was an adherent of Mírzá Yaḥyá, Siyyid Muḥammad was exiled with Bahá’u’lláh
