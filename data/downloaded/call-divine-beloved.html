                     “At one time We spoke in the language of the lawgiver”, Bahá’u’lláh writes in the
                     Epistle to
                     the Son of the Wolf, “at another in that of the truth-seeker and the mystic”.<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#062011707">1</a></sup>
                     The present volume brings together a selection of His Tablets which were revealed
                     in the
                     language of the mystic. Some are widely known; others are published here for the first
                     time
                     in English translation.
                     
                  </p>

                     <a id="019310107" class="brl-location"></a>
                     Although most of the Tablets in this collection were revealed during Bahá’u’lláh’s
                     sojourn
                     in ‘Iráq (1853–1863), the first, the poem known as “Ra<u>sh</u>ḥ-i-‘Amá”, was written in
                     1852 in the Síyáh-<u>Ch</u>ál and is among the few He revealed while in His native land of Persia,
                     and in verse. Bahá’u’lláh recounts: “During the days I lay in the prison of Ṭihrán,
                     though
                     the galling weight of the chains and the stench-filled air allowed Me but little sleep,
                     still in those infrequent moments of slumber I felt as if something flowed from the
                     crown of
                     My head over My breast, even as a mighty torrent that precipitateth itself upon the
                     earth
                     from the summit of a lofty mountain. Every limb of My body would, as a result, be
                     set afire.
                     At such moments My tongue recited what no man could bear to hear.”<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#712653818">2</a></sup>
                     The poetic reflection of that experience, as conveyed in Ra<u>sh</u>ḥ-i-‘Amá, can perhaps
                     never be adequately rendered into another language, yet the present translation is
                     an
                     initial attempt to impart a glimpse of its power and momentous themes.

                     In ‘Iráq, during the two years Bahá’u’lláh sought seclusion in the mountains of Kurdistán,
                     far from the malice and dissension that had blighted the Bábí community in Ba<u>gh</u>dád, word of
                     His presence in Sulaymáníyyih attracted religious scholars and mystics of the region,
                     including several prominent Ṣúfí <u>sh</u>ay<u>kh</u>s, to seek out the One Who dwelt as a humble dervish
                     yet evinced a wisdom that was profound and a power of expression unequalled: “Through
                     His
                     numerous discourses and epistles”, Shoghi Effendi writes, “He disclosed new vistas
                     to their
                     eyes, resolved the perplexities that agitated their minds, unfolded the inner meaning
                     of
                     many hitherto obscure passages in the writings of various commentators, poets and
                     theologians ... ‘In a short time,’ is ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s own testimony, ‘Kurdistán was
                     magnetized with His love. During this period Bahá’u’lláh lived in poverty. His garments
                     were
                     those of the poor and needy. His food was that of the indigent and lowly. An atmosphere
                     of
                     majesty haloed Him as the sun at midday. Everywhere He was greatly revered and loved.’
                     ”<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#077494930">3</a></sup>

                     When Bahá’u’lláh returned to Ba<u>gh</u>dád, His Kurdish admirers followed. The sight of ‘ulamá and
                     Ṣúfí <u>sh</u>ay<u>kh</u>s flocking to visit Bahá’u’lláh astonished the religious leaders of the city, who
                     also began to seek His presence—and became enthralled. Their esteem for Him in turn
                     attracted others, from poets and mystics to government officials, and further spread
                     His
                     fame.

                     This period, Shoghi Effendi tells us, saw an “enormous expansion in the scope and
                     volume of
                     Bahá’u’lláh’s writings ... The verses that streamed during those years from His pen,
                     described as ‘a copious rain’ by Himself, whether in the form of epistles, exhortations,
                     commentaries, apologies, dissertations, prophecies, prayers, odes or specific Tablets”
                     revivified and transformed the Bábí community. It was a period so prolific that, on
                     average,
                     the unrecorded verses He would reveal in a single day and night equalled in number
                     those of
                     the Qur’án. “As to those verses which He either dictated or wrote Himself, their number
                     was
                     no less remarkable than either the wealth of material they contained, or the diversity
                     of
                     subjects to which they referred.”<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#379375944">4</a></sup>

                     Among the “priceless treasures cast forth from the billowing ocean of Bahá’u’lláh’s
                     Revelation” in those days is Bahá’u’lláh’s “greatest mystical composition”, the Seven
                     Valleys, which “describes the seven stages which the soul of the seeker must needs
                     traverse
                     ere it can attain the object of its existence.”<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#871794007">5</a></sup>

                     This treatise was revealed in the language of the people, in the days prior to Our
                     Declaration. The occasion for its revelation was the receipt of a letter addressed
                     to the
                     Most Holy Court in ‘Iráq from a man of Sunní persuasion, who was both a scholar and
                     a
                     mystic. This treatise was therefore revealed, in accordance with divine wisdom, in
                     the
                     manner that was current amongst the people. However, in this day, every soul who hath
                     fixed
                     his gaze upon the Supreme Horizon, and hath recognized the one true God, hath verily
                     attained unto every one of the seven valleys or seven stations mentioned therein.<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#864692110">6</a></sup>

                     Like the twelfth-century poem by ‘Aṭṭár, <i>Manṭiqu’ṭ-Ṭayr (The Conference of the Birds)</i>, the
                     Seven Valleys describes a journey through seven stations in quest of the Divine. However,
                     the quest in the Seven Valleys is also one undertaken in a context defined by the
                     imminent
                     dawning of the new Revelation—and indeed the presence of the Beloved Himself.

                     That the mystic journey cannot be reduced to a fixed scheme, nor the search for the
                     Divine
                     Beloved to a series of discrete stages, is highlighted in a number of other Tablets,
                     four of
                     which are included here. The volume closes with the Four Valleys, an epistle addressed
                     to
                     one of Bahá’u’lláh’s devoted admirers from Kurdistán. Rather than describing a progression
                     through stages, it elaborates four different paths of approach to the Divine.

                     The current renderings of the Seven Valleys and the Four Valleys are based on the
                     translations by Marzieh Gail, in consultation with Ali-Kuli Khan, published in 1945.
                     While
                     those earlier translations contain many exquisite, inspired passages, some changes
                     were
                     required for clarity and accuracy.

                     May the publication of this volume contribute to a deeper appreciation of the mystical
                     dimensions of Bahá’u’lláh’s Message and inspire a greater zeal and fervour in raising
                     the
                     celestial call of the Divine Beloved: “For whereas in days past every lover besought
                     and
                     searched after his Beloved, it is the Beloved Himself Who now is calling His lovers
                     and is
                     inviting them to attain His presence.”<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#824534398">7</a></sup>

                        One must judge of search by the standard of the Majnún of love.<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#370836586">19</a></sup>
                        It is related that one day they came upon Majnún sifting the dust, his tears flowing
                        down.
                        They asked, “What doest thou?” He said, “I seek for Laylí.” “Alas for thee!” they
                        cried,
                        “Laylí is of pure spirit, yet thou seekest her in the dust!” He said, “I seek her
                        everywhere; haply somewhere I shall find her.”

                        Yea, though to the wise it be shameful to seek the Lord of Lords in the dust, yet
                        this
                        betokeneth intense ardour in searching. “Whoso seeketh out a thing and persisteth
                        with zeal
                        shall find it.”<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#092275427">20</a></sup>

                        The true seeker hunteth naught but the object of his quest, and the sincere lover
                        hath no
                        desire save reunion with his beloved. Nor shall the seeker reach his goal unless he
                        sacrifice all things. That is, whatever he hath seen, and heard, and understood—all
                        he must
                        set at naught with “no God is there”, that he may enter into the realm of the spirit,
                        which
                        is the city of “but God”.<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#260618470">21</a></sup>
                        Labour is needed, if we are to seek Him; ardour is needed, if we are to drink the
                        nectar of
                        reunion with Him; and if we taste of this cup, we shall cast away the world.

                        the Adored One.

                        from the night of error. He fleeth from both unbelief and faith, and findeth in deadly

                        happy the head that falleth on the dust in the path of His love. Wherefore, O friend,
                        renounce thy self, that thou mayest find the Peerless One; and soar beyond this mortal

                        Gazing with the eye of absolute insight, the wayfarer in this valley seeth in God’s
                        creation
                        neither contradiction nor incongruity, and at every moment exclaimeth, “No defect

                        He beholdeth justice in injustice, and in justice, grace. In ignorance he findeth
                        many a
                        knowledge hidden, and in knowledge a myriad wisdoms manifest. He breaketh the cage
                        of the
                        body and the hold of the passions, and communeth with the denizens of the immortal

                        scaleth the ladders of inner truth and hasteneth to the heaven of inner meanings.
                        He rideth
                        in the ark of “We will surely show them Our signs in the world and within themselves”,
                        and
                        saileth upon the sea of “until it become plain to them that it is the truth”.<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#901994679">30</a></sup>
                        And if he meeteth with injustice he shall have patience, and if he cometh upon wrath
                        he
                        shall manifest love.

                        There was once a lover, it is said, who had sighed for long years in separation from
                        his
                        beloved, and wasted in the fire of remoteness. From the rule of love, his breast was
                        void of
                        patience and his body weary of his spirit; he reckoned life without her as a mockery,
                        and
                        the world consumed him away. How many a day he found no respite from his longing;
                        how many a
                        night the pain of her kept him from sleep. His body was worn to a sigh, and his heart’s
                        wound had turned him to a cry of sorrow. A thousand lives would he freely have given
                        for one
                        taste of the cup of her presence, and yet even this was not within his reach. The
                        doctors
                        knew no cure for him, and companions avoided his company; yea, physicians have no
                        remedy for
                        one sick of love, unless the favour of the beloved deliver him.
                        
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a class="brl-pnum">26</a>
                        <a id="550012379" class="brl-location"></a>
                        At last the tree of his longing yielded the fruit of despair, and the fire of his
                        hope fell
                        to ashes. Then one night he could bear life no more, and he left his house for the
                        marketplace. On a sudden, a watchman followed after him. He broke into a run, with
                        the
                        watchman in swift pursuit; then other watchmen came together and barred every passage
                        to the
                        weary one. And that wretched one cried from his heart, and ran here and there, and
                        moaned to
                        himself, “Surely this watchman is ‘Izrá’íl, my angel of death, following so fast upon
                        me, or
                        he is a tyrant of men, prompted by hatred and malice.” His feet carried him on—that
                        hapless
                        one bleeding with the arrow of love—while his heart lamented. Then he came to a garden
                        wall,
                        and with untold pain and trouble he scaled it. He saw that it was very high; yet,
                        forgetting
                        his life, he threw himself down into the garden.
                        
                     </p>
                     <p>

                        And there he beheld his beloved with a lamp in her hand, searching for a ring she
                        had lost.
                        When the heart-surrendered lover looked upon his ravishing love, he drew a great breath
                        and
                        lifted his hands in prayer, crying, “O God! Bestow honour upon the watchman, and riches
                        and
                        long life. For the watchman was Gabriel, guiding this poor one; or he was Isráfíl,
                        bringing
                        life to this wretched one!”
                        
                     </p>
                     <p>

                        Indeed, his words were true; for he had found many a secret justice in this seeming
                        tyranny
                        of the watchman, and had seen how many a mercy lay hid behind the veil. In one stroke
                        of
                        wrath, the guard had joined one who was athirst in the desert of love to the sea of
                        the
                        beloved, and dispelled the darkness of separation with the shining light of reunion.
                        He had
                        led one who was afar to the garden of nearness, and guided an ailing soul to the heart’s
                        physician.
                        
                     </p>

                        Now if the lover could have seen the end, he would from the beginning have blessed
                        the
                        watchman, prayed God on his behalf, and seen his tyranny as justice; but since the
                        end was
                        veiled to him, he lamented and made his plaint in the beginning. Yet those who journey
                        in
                        the garden land of true knowledge, since they see the end in the beginning, behold
                        peace in
                        war and conciliation in enmity.

                        Such is the state of the wayfarers in this valley, but the people of the valleys above
                        this
                        see the end and the beginning as one. Nay, they see neither “beginning” nor “end”
                        and
                        witness neither “first” nor “last”. Nay rather, the denizens of the city of immortality,
                        who
                        dwell in the celestial garden, see not even “neither first nor last”: They fly from
                        all that
                        is first and repulse all that is last. For these have passed over the worlds of names
                        and,
                        swift as lightning, fled beyond the worlds of attributes. Thus is it said: “The perfection
                        of belief in Divine Unity is to deny Him any attributes.”<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#146823914">31</a></sup>

                        sheddeth its bounty according to the potentialities of that place. For instance, in
                        a mirror
                        it reflecteth its own disk and shape, and this is due to the clarity of the mirror
                        itself;
                        through a crystal it maketh fire to appear; and in other things it showeth only the
                        effect
                        of its shining, but not its full disk. And yet, through that effect, by the command
                        of the
                        Creator it traineth each thing according to the capacity of that thing, even as thou
                        dost
                        observe.

                        In like manner, colours become visible in each object according to its nature. For
                        instance,
                        in a yellow glass the rays shine yellow; in a white glass they are white; and in a
                        red glass
                        red rays are visible. These variations proceed from the object itself, not from the
                        light.
                        And if a place be shut away from the light, as by walls and a roof, it will be entirely
                        bereft of the light of the sun and deprived of its rays.

                        Thus it is that certain feeble souls have confined the wide expanse of knowledge within
                        the
                        walls of self and passion, and beneath the cloak of ignorance and blindness, and have
                        thereby veiled themselves from the light of the mystic Sun and the mysteries of the
                        eternal
                        Beloved. They have strayed far from the gem-like wisdom of the resplendent Faith of
                        the Lord
                        of the Messengers,<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#438617648">38</a></sup>

                        In sum, the differences among objects have now been made plain. Thus when the wayfarer
                        gazeth only upon the place of appearance—that is, when he considereth only the glass—he
                        seeth yellow and red and white. And so it is that conflict hath prevailed amongst
                        men, and a
                        darksome dust from limited souls hath settled over the world. Others gaze upon the
                        effulgence of the light, while yet others have drunk of the wine of oneness and see
                        naught
                        but the sun itself.

                        As the wayfarers traverse these three differing planes, their understanding and their
                        words
                        differ accordingly, and hence the sign of conflict hath ever appeared on earth. For
                        there
                        are some who dwell on the plane of Divine Unity and speak of that world, and some
                        inhabit
                        the realms of limitation, and some the grades of self, while others are completely
                        veiled.
                        Thus do the ignorant people of the day, who have no share of the radiance of the divine
                        Beauty, make certain claims and, in every age and cycle, inflict upon the people of
                        the
                        ocean of Divine Unity what they themselves deserve. “If God should chastise men for
                        their
                        perverse doings, He would not leave upon the earth a moving thing! But to an appointed

                        doth He respite them.”<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#522391450">40</a></sup>

                        O My brother! A pure heart is as a mirror; cleanse it with the burnish of love and
                        severance
                        from all save God, that the true sun may shine therein and the eternal morning dawn.
                        Then
                        wilt thou clearly see the meaning of “Earth and heaven cannot contain Me; what can
                        alone
                        contain Me is the heart of him that believeth in Me.”<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#061371159">41</a></sup>

                        newly found Beloved.

                        the heart and soul, His radiance becometh visible in every limb and member. At that
                        time,
                        the mystery of the famed tradition gleameth out of the darkness: “A servant is drawn

                        of the
                        dwelling are ashine with His light. And as the action and effect of the light are

                        Light-Giver, so it is that all move through Him and arise by His will. This is that

                        However, let none construe these utterances to imply the incarnation or descent of
                        the
                        worlds of God into the grades of His creatures, nor should they lead thine eminence
                        to such

                        egress and regress; He hath through all eternity been exalted beyond the attributes
                        of His
                        creation, and will ever remain so. No man hath ever known Him; no soul hath ever fathomed

                        knowledge of the effulgences of that Sun of Truth as it becometh reflected in various
                        mirrors. And the effulgence of that light is present within the hearts, yet it is
                        hidden

                        that Essence of existence and longed-for Mystery. O My brother, consider these matters
                        in
                        the spirit of enquiry, not in blind imitation. A true wayfarer will not be deterred

                        Infer, then, from this the differences among the worlds. Though the worlds of God
                        be
                        infinite, yet some refer to them as four: the world of time, which hath both a beginning
                        and
                        an end; the world of duration, which hath a beginning but whose end is not apparent;
                        the
                        world of primordial reality, whose beginning is not to be seen but which is known
                        to have an
                        end; and the world of eternity, of which neither the beginning nor the end is visible.
                        Although there are many differing statements as to these points, to recount them in
                        detail
                        would result in weariness. Thus some have said that the world of primordial reality
                        hath neither
                        beginning nor end, and have equated the world of eternity with the invisible, inaccessible,
                        and unknowable Essence. Others have called these the worlds of the Heavenly Court,
                        of the
                        Celestial Dominion, of the Divine Kingdom, and of Mortal Existence.

                        Moreover, the journeys in the pathway of love have been reckoned as four: from the
                        creatures
                        to the True One, from the True One to the creatures, from the creatures to the creatures,

                        There is many an utterance of the sages and mystics of former times which I have not
                        mentioned here, since I mislike copious citation from the sayings of the past; for
                        quotation
                        from the words of others betokeneth acquired learning and not divine bestowal. Even
                        so much
                        as I have quoted here is out of deference to the wont of men and after the manner
                        of the
                        learned. Further, such matters are beyond the scope of this epistle. My unwillingness
                        to
                        recount their sayings is not from pride; rather, it is the manifestation of wisdom
                        and the
                        revelation of bounty.

                        Although a brief example hath been given concerning the beginning and ending of the
                        relative
                        and contingent world, yet a further illustration is now provided, that the full meaning
                        may
                        become clear. For instance, let thine eminence consider his own self: Thou art first
                        in
                        relation to thy son, and last in relation to thy father. In thine outward appearance
                        thou
                        tellest of the appearance of power in the realms of divine creation; in thine inward
                        being
                        thou revealest the hidden mysteries which are the divine trust deposited within thee.
                        And
                        thus firstness and lastness, outwardness and inwardness, are, in the sense referred
                        to, all
                        true of thyself, so that in these four states conferred upon thee thou mayest comprehend
                        the
                        four divine states, and that the nightingale of thine heart, warbling on all the flowering
                        branches of the tree of existence, whether seen or unseen, might cry out: “He is the
                        First
                        and the Last, the Seen and the Hidden!”<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#068658515">50</a></sup>

                        These statements are made in the sphere of that which is relative. Otherwise, those
                        souls
                        who with but one step have traversed the world of the relative and the conditioned,
                        and
                        dwelt in the court of independent sovereignty, and pitched their tent in the realms
                        of
                        absolute authority and command, have burned away these relativities with a single
                        spark, and
                        blotted out these words with a mere dewdrop. And they swim in the sea of the spirit,
                        and
                        soar in the holy atmosphere of light. Then what existence have words, on such a plane,
                        that
                        “first” and “last”, or other than these, should be mentioned or described? In this
                        realm,
                        the first is the same as the last, and the last is the same as the first.

                        imperishable wine of this valley. And shouldst thou taste of it, thou wilt turn away
                        from
                        all else and drink of the cup of contentment; thou wilt loose thyself from all things
                        and
                        bind thyself unto Him, and lay down thy life in His path and offer up thy soul for
                        His sake.
                        And this, even though in this realm there is no “all else” that thou needst forget:
                        “God was
                        alone; there was none else besides Him.”<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#900690931">56</a></sup>
                        For on this plane the traveller witnesseth the beauty of the Friend in all things.
                        In fire
                        he seeth the face of the Beloved; in illusion he beholdeth the secret of reality;
                        in the
                        attributes he readeth the riddle of the Essence. For he hath burnt away all veils
                        with a
                        sigh, and cast aside all coverings with a glance. With piercing sight he gazeth upon
                        the new
                        creation, and with lucid heart he graspeth subtle verities. The words “And we have
                        made thy
                        sight sharp in this day”<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#543030761">57</a></sup>
                        are a sufficient proof of this assertion and a befitting description of this state.

                        After journeying through the planes of pure contentment, the traveller cometh to <span class="brl-smallcaps">the Valley
                           of Wonderment
                           </span> and is tossed upon the oceans of grandeur, and at every moment his wonder
                        increaseth. Now he seeth the embodiment of wealth as poverty itself, and the essence
                        of
                        independence as sheer impotence. Now is he struck dumb with the beauty of the All-Glorious;
                        again is he wearied out with his own life. How many a mystic tree hath this whirlwind
                        of
                        bewilderment snatched by the roots, how many a soul hath it worn out and exhausted.
                        For in
                        this valley the traveller is flung into confusion, albeit, in the eyes of him who
                        hath
                        attained, such signs are esteemed and well beloved. At every moment, he beholdeth
                        a wondrous
                        world and a new creation, and goeth from astonishment to astonishment, and is lost
                        in awe
                        before the new handiwork of Him Who is the sovereign Lord of all.

                        Indeed, O brother, if we ponder each created thing, we shall witness a myriad consummate
                        wisdoms and learn a myriad new and wondrous truths. One of the created phenomena is
                        the
                        dream. Behold how many secrets have been deposited therein, how many wisdoms treasured
                        up,
                        how many worlds concealed. Observe how thou art asleep in a dwelling, and its doors
                        are
                        shut; on a sudden thou findest thyself in a far-off city, which thou enterest without
                        moving
                        thy feet or wearying thy body. Without taxing thine eyes, thou seest; without troubling
                        thine ears, thou hearest; without a tongue, thou speakest. And perchance when ten
                        years have
                        passed, thou wilt witness in this temporal world the very things thou hast dreamt
                        tonight.

                        Now there are many wisdoms to ponder in the dream, which none but the people of this
                        valley
                        can comprehend in their reality. First, what is this world where without eye or ear
                        or hand
                        or tongue one can put all these to use? Second, how is it that in the outer world
                        thou seest
                        today the effect of a dream which thou didst witness in the world of sleep some ten
                        years
                        past? Consider the difference between these two worlds, and the mysteries they conceal,
                        that, attended by divine confirmations, thou mayest attain unto heavenly discoveries
                        and
                        enter the realms of holiness.

                        God, the Most High, hath placed these signs in men so that veiled minds might not

                        mysteries of the life beyond, nor belittle that which hath been promised them. For
                        some hold
                        fast to reason and deny whatever reason comprehendeth not, and yet feeble minds can
                        never
                        grasp the reality of the stages that we have related: The universal divine Intellect

                        can comprehend them.

                        Likewise, Luqmán, who had drunk from the wellspring of wisdom and tasted of the waters
                        of

                        O My friend! Listen with heart and soul to the songs of the spirit, and treasure them
                        as
                        thine own eyes; for heavenly wisdoms, even as vernal showers, will not rain forever
                        upon the
                        earth of men’s hearts, and though the grace of the All-Bounteous One is never ceasing
                        and
                        never stilled, yet to every time and era a portion is allotted and a bounty assigned,
                        which
                        is vouchsafed in a given measure. “And no one thing is there, but with Us are its
                        storehouses; and We send it not down but in settled measure.”<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#158719843">67</a></sup>
                        Indeed, the clouds of the Loved One’s mercy rain only on the garden of the spirit,
                        and
                        bestow this bounty only in the season of spring. Other seasons have no share in this
                        supernal grace, and barren lands hold no portion of this bounteous favour.

                     from the promptings of self, then approach thy Lord.” The second meaneth “Purify thyself
                     from all save Him, that thou mayest offer up thy life for His sake.” The third meaneth
                     “Draw
                     back from the threshold of the one true God if thou art still possessed of earthly
                     attributes.” The fourth meaneth “Render thanks unto thy Lord on His earth, that He
                     may bless
                     thee in His heaven, albeit in the realm of His unity His heaven is the same as His
                     earth.”
                     The fifth meaneth “Remove from thine eyes the veils of limitation, that thou mayest
                     learn
                     that which thou knewest not of the stations of holiness.”

                     aforetime an Epistle in the lucid Arabian tongue, and I now reveal for thee this Tablet
                     in
                     wondrous Persian prose, that thou mayest hear, in the glorious accents of the Nightingale
                     of
                     ‘Iráq, the sweet melodies of the nearness of the heavenly Paradise that had, ere this,
                     been
                     intoned in the language of Ḥijáz.<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#731386140">78</a></sup>
                     Perchance thou mayest become pure spirit; attain, without taking a single step, the
                     loftiest
                     stations of mystic ascent; and explore, without leaving thine outward habitation,
                     the
                     furthermost reaches of the worlds of inner significance. Thereupon wouldst thou, with
                     a
                     divine rapture, experience true spiritual attraction, lay down thy life in the path
                     of the
                     Friend, and sacrifice thy soul in the wilderness of His love. This indeed is the meaning
                     of
                     stillness in flight and flight in stillness, of fluidity in solidity and solidity
                     in

                     To continue: It is clear that the wayfarers in the wilderness of search and longing,
                     of
                     attainment and reunion, have numerous degrees and countless stations. Some, after
                     spiritual
                     struggle and physical toil, ascend from the lower reaches of “no God is there” to
                     the lofty
                     bowers of “but God”,<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#594654380">79</a></sup>
                     flee from the shadow of negation to abide in the limitless realm of affirmation, and
                     abandon
                     the privation of a transient existence for the bountiful assemblage of reunion. This
                     is the
                     uttermost limit of the realm of effort and striving.

                     Others, without receiving the least intimation of “no God is there”, pass beyond the
                     highest
                     horizon of “but God”; without even tasting a dewdrop of the degrees of self-surrender
                     ascend
                     unto the kingdom of life everlasting; and without partaking from the wellspring of
                     utter
                     abnegation quaff the wine of the Ancient of Days. These souls, as they traverse the
                     stages
                     of wayfaring and ascend unto the stations of reunion, walk a different path and occupy
                     a
                     different rank.

                     Still others, without having perused a single letter of the kingdom of names or acquired
                     the
                     faintest intimation from the realm of attributes, which pertaineth to this world,
                     dawn above
                     the invisible horizon of eternity and return again thereunto. A hundred thousand seas
                     of
                     glory surge in their luminous hearts, and yet to outward seeming their lips are parched;
                     a
                     myriad rivers of holiness stream within their breasts, and yet no trace thereof is
                     to be
                     seen; the books of God’s consummate wisdom are recorded upon the tablets of their
                     hearts,
                     and yet they breathe not a word thereof in the world of appearances. They dwell in
                     the Egypt
                     of certitude and journey in the lands of resignation. They are intoxicated with the
                     beauty,
                     and entranced by the glory, of Him Who is the All-Glorious. Heart to heart they whisper
                     hidden secrets; soul to soul they unfold abstruse matters. The mysteries of the Divine
                     Essence glow upon their brows, and the lights of Divine Unity shine from their peerless
                     faces. They clothe themselves in the robe of concealment and cast their sleeves over
                     both
                     this world and the world to come. Without wings they soar, without feet they walk,
                     without
                     hands they grasp and hold. They speak an unknown tongue and observe an unseen grammar,
                     of
                     which all the world’s inhabitants know not a single letter, save those whom thy Lord
                     hath
                     willed. Unto each hath a share been vouchsafed in His Book, and they shall all attain
                     unto
                     that which hath been destined for them.

                     It is clear and evident that, in this Dispensation wherein the banner of utterance
                     hath been
                     raised aloft and the candle of discernment hath been lit, there is no Lord but the
                     Exalted
                     One.<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#744344304">80</a></sup>
                     He it is Who is one in His essence and one in His attributes, single in the kingdom
                     of names
                     and peerless in the realm of actions. It is by virtue of His blessed name that the
                     seas of
                     Divine Unity have been made to surge; it is through the power of His resistless command
                     that
                     the immutable decrees of destiny have been enforced; it is through the potency of
                     His
                     sovereign might that the dictates of fate have been fixed. Who hath the power to soar
                     in
                     that exalted atmosphere or to cherish another beloved than Him? We all abide beneath
                     His
                     shadow and seek our portion from the ocean of His grace. However far the gnat may
                     fly, it
                     can never traverse the length and breadth of heaven, and however high the sparrow
                     may soar,
                     it can never attain the tree of immortality.

                     But since all do not possess the same degree of spiritual understanding, certain statements
                     will inevitably be made, and there shall arise, as a consequence, as many differing
                     opinions
                     as there are human minds, and as many divergent beliefs as there are created things.
                     This is
                     certain and settled, and can in no wise be averted. Now, it is clear that some are
                     virtuous,
                     others are sinful, and still others are rebellious. One must call the people to love
                     and
                     faithfulness, to zeal and contentment, that the sinful may be admonished and the ranks
                     of
                     the virtuous may swell. Nor is it possible that there be no sinners: So long as the
                     name
                     “the Ever-Forgiving” shineth resplendent above the horizon of existence, there will
                     be
                     sinners in the world of creation, for the latter cannot appear without the former
                     and the
                     former cannot exist without the latter.

                     Our aim is that thou shouldst urge all the believers to show forth kindness and mercy
                     and to
                     overlook certain shortcomings among them, that differences may be dispelled; true
                     harmony be
                     established; and the censure and reproach, the hatred and dissension, seen among the
                     peoples
                     of former times may not arise anew. Perchance they may be educated and, in the latter
                     Resurrection,<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#308942550">81</a></sup>
                     inflict not upon that cherished Spirit and Essence of existence, that exalted and
                     subtle
                     Reality, the least of that which the Point of the Bayán was made to suffer.

                     Moreover, a reply to thine enquiries was sent aforetime. It is evident that whatever
                     question is asked will be answered through the ocean of eternal grace, but such questions
                     also add to the burden of duties imposed upon the servants. That which hath been recorded
                     at
                     God’s behest in the Persian Bayán is indeed sufficient unto all, and none will be
                     held to
                     account for what it hath not commanded. Consider how numerous were those in the early
                     days
                     of the Revelation who obeyed, without the slightest deviation, every least one of
                     its
                     injunctions and yet reaped no benefit therefrom. The beginning of religion is love
                     for God
                     and for His Chosen Ones, and its end is to manifest that love to His servants.

                     I swear by God! Whoso faileth to obey the commandments of God can in no wise be numbered
                     among His loved ones, for among the conditions of His love is to follow His commandments
                     and
                     observe His prohibitions. But since these are the days of concealment, and the Sun
                     of
                     eternity remaineth hidden beneath the horizon of being, one must gather together everyone
                     with love and protect them. The time for the completion of the commandments and the
                     perfection of deeds will assuredly come.

                     Many a day hath passed, and still the sweet fragrance of thy faithfulness hath failed
                     to
                     reach Us. Hast thou forgotten the One Who forgetteth thee not, and forsaketh thee
                     not, and
                     neglecteth thee not, even as thou hast forgotten, forsaken, and neglected Him?

                     We have heard that sorrows have compassed thee round in these days. Thy sorrow hath
                     grieved
                     Us, and that which hath befallen thee hath touched Us with bitter pain and anguish.
                     But at
                     this moment, O friend, the Herald of eternity announceth unto thee, by the robe of
                     faithfulness, His joyful tidings and bestoweth upon thee this emerald-green Tablet.
                     Set out,
                     then, from thine abode, take thou seven steps upon the earth, and with each step complete
                     a
                     stage of the journey.

                     With the first, enter the ocean of search and seek God, thy Lord, with thine inmost
                     heart
                     and soul.

                     With the second, enter the ocean of love and make mention of God, thy Lord, in the
                     transports of thy longing and the ecstasies of thy rapture.

                     With the third, tread the paths of detachment; that is, sever thyself from thine idle
                     fancies and walk in the ways of thy Lord.

                     With the fourth, enter the fathomless depths of oneness and the billowing seas of
                     eternity.
                     Cover thy face in the dust before the Lord of Lords, and sanctify thy self and thy
                     spirit
                     from all departure and return, that thine inmost heart may be freed from all things
                     in the
                     kingdoms of creation.

                     With the fifth, ascend unto the heaven of wonderment, that thou mayest taste the goodly
                     fruits of this blessed realm, lose thyself in bewilderment before the power of thy
                     Beloved
                     and the dominion of thy Creator, and proclaim that which the King of existence and
                     the Goal
                     of all desire hath proclaimed: “Increase my wonder and amazement at Thee, O God!”<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#754246249">82</a></sup>

                     With the sixth, soar upon the wings of submission and contentment unto the cities
                     of the
                     Unseen, that thou mayest enter the expanses of utter nothingness wherein thou shalt
                     die to
                     thy self and live in Him Who hath fashioned thee.

                     With the seventh, drown thyself in the depths of eternity, that death may not overtake
                     thee,
                     and that thou mayest abide forever in the shadow of the everlasting Face of God. Thereupon
                     shall the fragrance of the All-Glorious be diffused from the realm of the All-Merciful,
                     and
                     thy heart shall grieve no more over the vicissitudes of a fleeting life and the turns
                     of a
                     transient fortune.

                     When once thou hast privily completed these journeys, place this robe upon thy sightless
                     eyes, that the eye of thine inmost heart may be opened. By God, O My friend! Wert
                     thou to
                     attain unto this station, thou wouldst find wondrous worlds; discover heavenly bowers,
                     celestial gardens, and transcendent realms; and unravel the secrets of the progress
                     of the
                     souls of men through the atmosphere of eternal holiness and the heavens of imperishable
                     glory. Thou wouldst so rejoice within thy soul as to cause the signs of joy and gladness
                     to
                     appear throughout the whole earth. Thereafter, sorrow would never again hold sway
                     over thee,
                     nor would grief ever seize thee in its grasp, for thou wouldst abide in the heaven
                     of
                     holiness amidst the concourse of the blissful.

                     Know thou, moreover, that in the sight of God thou holdest a lofty rank and an exalted
                     station. Remove not thyself from the company of His servants; rather do thou gather
                     them
                     together in the Cause of God and admonish them in His days. Rely upon God in all thine
                     affairs. He, verily, shall suffice thee in all things, shall protect thee from the
                     followers
                     of the Evil One, and shall cause thee to enter the everlasting Paradise, wherein thou
                     shalt
                     be numbered with the blessed. Convey, then, Our greetings unto those who follow thee
                     in the
                     Cause of thy Lord, and summon them unto the Straight Path.

                     Hearken with all thy heart unto the nightingale song of the Beloved, that perchance
                     thou
                     mayest abandon the habitation of self and desire and step into the placeless realm
                     of
                     eternal glory, forsake thine own life, and commune with Him Who is the life of thy
                     life.
                     Wert thou to traverse the limitless reaches of the spirit, thou wouldst of a certainty
                     rend
                     asunder the garment of patience and forbearance, hasten to offer up thy soul, renounce
                     the
                     dross of this fleeting world, and find repose upon the throne of ancient glory.
                     
                  </p>

                     Each thing must needs have an effect and each sign reveal a secret. Not until the
                     world-illuming sun hath shone can the east be distinguished from the west, nor the
                     blooming
                     garden discerned from the barren waste. Heavenly strains compare not with earthly
                     clamours,
                     and the croaking of the raven can in no wise be confounded with the song of the nightingale.
                     For the latter bespeaketh the land of the Beloved and increaseth life, whereas the
                     former
                     telleth only of the city of the blind and causeth faith to wither.

                     One must step forth and raise aloft the banner of earnest striving. By God! Wert thou
                     to
                     hearken unto the heavenly words of this evanescent Servant that have been raised in
                     this
                     mystic Tablet, thou wouldst assuredly take to the desert of self-surrender, turn aside
                     from
                     thine own heart and soul, and cast thy head at the feet of the Friend. How high is
                     the
                     soaring flight of the phoenix of love, and how low the requisite measure of our yearning!
                     Strive but a little to soar, that, by the grace of Him Who is the eternal King, thou
                     mayest
                     ascend from the dust-heap of utter non-existence unto the loftiest heights of ancient
                     glory.
                     Give wings to thy celestial spirit and lend strength to thy mystic soul, that haply
                     it may
                     take flight in the atmosphere of divine nearness and attain the ultimate and invisible
                     goal.

                     This profitless world produceth naught save deadly poison, and its ephemeral dregs
                     can never
                     yield the everlasting cup. Were the Jesus of the spirit to give ear to the call of
                     holiness
                     from the Falcon of the realm above, He would assuredly cry out from His inmost being
                     and be
                     seized with fervid longing even as the lover’s soul. It is through that call that
                     the Moses
                     of eternity was dumbfounded; it is by its virtue that the Abraham of faithfulness
                     shattered
                     the idol of the mortal body. Shatter then, in turn, this idol, that thou mayest take
                     up
                     thine abode in the land of the Beloved; and forsake all desire, that thou mayest take
                     flight
                     unto the Egypt of imperishable glory. Sanctify the city of thine heart, that thou
                     mayest
                     behold the beauty of the Divine Essence and be quickened to a new life through the
                     grace of
                     the Holy Spirit.

                     to Him Whose Essence is immeasurably exalted above the strivings of human hearts,
                     however
                     pure, to soar into the atmosphere of His nearness, and Whose Being is immensely sanctified
                     beyond the exertions of human minds, however lofty, to ascend unto the heaven of His
                     presence. From time immemorial He hath been exalted above the description of aught
                     save
                     Himself, and He will forever continue to be sanctified beyond the praise of all created
                     things. The hearts of them that have recognized Him are sore perplexed before the
                     tokens of
                     His everlasting handiwork, and the minds of them that have attained His court are
                     bewildered
                     by the wondrous evidences of the Revealers of His oneness. He, verily, is the
                     All-Possessing, the Almighty, the Most Glorious, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting.

                     O friend! Thine epistle was received. It told of naught save the fire which hath been
                     kindled in the tree of human reality, and bore no message but that which bestoweth
                     a new
                     life upon enlightened hearts. Well is it with him that hath been set ablaze by the
                     fire of
                     thy love, and who hath quaffed the water of life from the cup of thine affection.
                     “The
                     righteous shall drink of a cup tempered at the camphor fountain.”<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#774500690">84</a></sup>

                     To continue: Thy letter, which was a repository of the pearls of celestial knowledge,
                     was
                     brought before this Exile. God be praised, it rolled up the scrolls of separation
                     and
                     remoteness and spread out in their stead the realms of nearness and reunion. Methinks
                     through the water of thy longing the fire of separation was changed into “coolness
                     and
                     safety”.<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#535098003">85</a></sup>
                     In truth, a perfect meeting was attained through thy letter, and, through thy mention
                     of the
                     stations of Divine Unity and the signs of pure abstraction and oneness, it lifted
                     from the
                     world the veils of limitation. And this, notwithstanding that even the limitations
                     of the
                     world of existence are praised and cherished by the wayfarer, for he seeth all things
                     in the
                     mirror of the verse “No defect canst thou see in the creation of the God of mercy”,
                     and at
                     every moment he heareth with his inner ear the tongue of the Holy Spirit uttering
                     the words
                     “Seest thou a single flaw?”<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#804295421">86</a></sup>
                     In faithlessness he beholdeth the secret of fidelity, and in deadly poison he tasteth
                     the
                     sweetest honey. Even vengeance is embraced in this state; nay more, the true lover
                     welcometh
                     the betrayal of the beloved.

                     Thus do the wayfarers in the wilderness of solitude and search experience events and
                     conditions which, though to outward seeming be a mortal poison, are inwardly a wholesome
                     draught, and though in appearance a passing mirage, are in reality pure and refreshing
                     waters. Were I to attempt a full description of this station, neither could I express
                     it nor
                     the hearer grasp it. And whoso observeth with the eye of innate knowledge will confess,
                     openly as well as privily, the selfsame truth.

                     As to perceived differences, these can be attributed to the divers stations that have
                     been
                     attained by them that tread the path of search and mystic knowledge. Thus, at one
                     time the
                     wayfarer beholdeth the lover hastening in search of the beloved through the wilderness
                     of
                     desolation, and at another he seeth the beloved yearning for the lover across the
                     wilds of
                     longing and devotion, or wandering, aimless and bewildered, the wastes of love in
                     his
                     pursuit.

                     From yet another vantage he perceiveth that the lover and the beloved are one and
                     the same,
                     and that the seeker is himself the very object of his search. “How can the lover from
                     the
                     loved one ever part?”<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#188329889">89</a></sup>
                     So it is that, at times, the lovers of the celestial Beauty sound the clarion of “Say:
                     All
                     things are of God”, while, at others, they raise the call of “It is from thyself.”<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#896972476">90</a></sup>

                     Some have related the aforementioned stages to the inner and outer journeys of the
                     soul,
                     which is the station of “the knowledge of certitude”, whilst others that have quaffed
                     the
                     wine of reunion regard each and every stage as relating to that knowledge, and consider
                     the
                     two stations of “the eye of certitude” and “the truth of certitude” as being exalted
                     above
                     and sanctified beyond these realms and all that pertaineth unto them, even as hath
                     been
                     clearly affirmed by that mystic knower.<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#378556310">91</a></sup>
                     For in all these stages the mirror of the wayfarer’s heart may bear the reflection
                     of
                     shadowy desires, wayward thoughts, and worldly attachments. Wherefore hath it been
                     said
                     that, in these stations, at one time the hosts of reason are triumphant and, at another,
                     the
                     armies of love prevail. At one time, the clouds of affliction and sorrow conceal the
                     heavens
                     of gladness and joy; at another, the eternal leviathan of love devoureth, in one fleeting
                     moment, all manifestations of sadness, anguish, grief, and dejection, and the morn
                     of divine
                     guidance dawneth forth with the joyful tidings of “despair not of God’s mercy”,<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#169093148">92</a></sup>
                      and the gentle breezes of His providence dispel every vestige of torpor and estrangement.
                     These tidings, however, are not constant and immutable in these stations, and the
                     wayfarer
                     remaineth confined between the right hand of faith and assurance and the left hand
                     of denial
                     and despair.

                     Some wayfarers remain forever veiled in these stages. Others are assisted by invisible
                     aid
                     from the Source of unfailing grace, whereat the hosts of the Realm on high raise the
                     tabernacle of divine power, and the ascendency of “and verily Our host shall conquer”<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#465530598">93</a></sup>
                     is manifested, obliterating the signs and standards of every worldly attachment and
                     limitation, even as alluded to by some who have attained this station. At such times,
                     the
                     ascendancy of God’s names and attributes will so surround a soul as to leave it no
                     place
                     either to stay or to flee. This station, however, hath its own obscurities and impediments,
                     for they that journey towards the land of Divine Unity and detachment are still wrapt
                     within
                     the confines of names and attributes, and take delight in their gardens and bowers.
                     Thus it
                     is that, in describing these stations, some have made reference to the “unity of existence”
                     and the “unity of appearance”.<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#379190904">94</a></sup>
                     By this is meant that the seeker will close his eyes to all save his Beloved and open
                     them
                     to naught but His beauty. He will pass beyond the mortal world and approach the everlasting
                     realm. He will see no beauty but the Beloved’s and hear no utterance but His praise;
                     that
                     is, he will avert his gaze from aught save His beauty and refuse to hearken to any
                     melody
                     but the sweet accents of His voice. Howbeit some are led astray even in this station;
                     for no
                     sooner do they inhale the fragrance of reunion, and hearken unto the voice of the
                     doves of
                     heavenly grace, than they imagine themselves to have attained perfection and wander
                     lost in
                     the wilderness of self-conceit, thus depriving themselves of the soft-flowing stream
                     of
                     divine providence and the ethereal cup of heavenly delight.

                     Yet others, assisted by the grace of the everlasting Friend, consume these veils with
                     the
                     fire of His love and step into the meads of ancient glory. That is, forsaking the
                     wilderness
                     of the “unity of existence”, they attain unto the ultimate abode of the “true appearance
                     of
                     the Divine Unity”. So clearly will they witness in this stage God’s all-encompassing
                     mercy
                     that in every created thing, both in the world and in the souls of men, they will
                     behold Him
                     Who hath been interpreted as the Holy Outpouring. No longer will they close their
                     eyes to
                     any beauty, nor stop their ears from hearkening to any voice. For there is no prohibition
                     in
                     this stage and no debarment, inasmuch as in all things they will discern, with both
                     their
                     outer and inner eyes, the revelation of the signs of Him Who is the King of all names
                     and
                     attributes, and in every atom they will find a door that leadeth to the garden of
                     Divine
                     Unity and the city of pure abstraction. “Where’er I turn my gaze, ’tis Thee Whom I
                     behold.”
                     So entirely will the hearts of the wayfarers be transported by longing for the ecstasies
                     of
                     this station that they will come to conceive no stage apart from this stage, to see
                     themselves as abiding within the court of the Beloved and circling round His sanctuary,
                     and
                     to consider it as the ultimate abode of them that search and the uttermost station
                     of such
                     as have attained.

                     A myriad names and attributes have been ascribed to these degrees and stations, which
                     I am
                     disinclined to mention here. It is, indeed, solely because of thy longing and devotion

                     I have engaged in such ephemeral and limited topics. And this, notwithstanding that
                     speech
                     is the greatest evidence of the worth of the speaker and guideth unto the recognition
                     of the
                     source of guidance, for no more complete and enduring proof hath been or will be vouchsafed
                     unto man from the empyrean of everlasting glory than words and utterance. This, verily,
                     is a
                     self-evident truth, for the braying of the donkey can never compare with the cooing
                     of the
                     dove. Never wilt thou hear from the raven the melodies of the nightingale, nor inhale
                     from
                     the abject beetle the fragrance of eternity.

                        The story is told of a mystic knower who went on a journey with a learned grammarian
                        for a

                        trust in
                        God, straightway flung himself into the waves, but the grammarian stood bewildered
                        and lost
                        in thoughts that were as words traced upon the water. The mystic called out to him,
                        “Why
                        dost thou not follow?” The grammarian answered, “O brother, what can I do? As I dare
                        not
                        advance, I must needs go back again.” Then the mystic cried, “Cast aside what thou
                        hast
                        learned from Síbavayh and Qawlavayh, from Ibn-i-Ḥájib and Ibn-i-Málik, and cross the

                        On this plane, the traveller meeteth with many a trial and reverse. Now is he lifted
                        up to
                        heaven, now is he cast into the depths. As it hath been said: “Now Thou drawest me
                        to the
                        throne of the realms above, again Thou scorchest me in the fire of hell.” The hidden
                        mystery
                        of this station is divulged in the following blessed verse from the Súrih of the Cave:
                        “And
                        thou mightest have seen the sun when it arose, pass on the right of their cave, and
                        when it
                        set, leave them on the left, while they were in its spacious chamber. This is one
                        of the
                        signs of God. Guided indeed is he whom God guideth; but for him whom He misleadeth,
                        thou
                        shalt by no means find a guardian and guide.”<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#777068682">110</a></sup>

                        him.
                        Such indeed are those whom He hath extolled as “men whom neither merchandise nor traffic
                        beguile from the remembrance of God”.<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#648329647">111</a></sup>

                        and
                        trials. Nor is it needed, in this realm, to seek after knowledge, for He hath said

                        self. Thus
                        one of the Prophets of God asked, “O my Lord, how shall I reach Thee?” And the answer
                        came:
                        “Leave thy self behind, and then approach Me.”

                        to abide at the place of honour, and in the path of the Beloved the retreats of earthly

                        The dwellers of this abode know not the destination, yet they spur on their chargers.
                        They
                        see naught in the Beloved but His very Self. They find all words of sense to be meaningless,
                        and senseless words to be full of meaning. They cannot distinguish head from foot

                        This is the realm of pure awareness and utter self-effacement. Not even love can find
                        a way
                        to this plane, nor doth affection have a place therein. Wherefore is it said: “Love
                        is a
                        veil betwixt the lover and the beloved.” Here love becometh but an obstructing veil,

                     When I entrusted this message of love to My pen, it refused the burden and swooned
                     away.
                     Then, coming to itself, it spoke and said, “Glory be to Thee! To Thee do I turn in
                     penitence, and I am the first of them that implore Thy pardon.”<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#942700934">137</a></sup>

                                 extremely thin and subtle cloud, seen and then not seen. For
                                 shouldst thou gaze with the utmost care, thou wouldst discern
                                 something, but as soon as thou dost look again, it ceaseth to be
                                 seen. For this reason, in the usage of mystics who seek after truth,
                                 ‘Amá’ signifieth the Universal Reality without individuations as
                                 such, for these individuations exist in the mode of uncompounded
                                 simplicity and oneness and are not differentiated from the Divine
                                 Essence. Thus they are individuated and not individuated. This is
                                 the station alluded to by the terms Aḥadíyyih [Absolute Oneness] and
                                 ‘Amá’. This is the station of the “Hidden Treasure” mentioned in the
                                 Ḥadíth. The divine attributes, therefore, are individuations that
                                 exist in the Essence but are not differentiated therefrom. They are
                                 seen and then not seen. This, in brief, is what is meant by ‘Amá’.”
