                     <a id="152001587" class="brl-location"></a>“The winds of despair,” Bahá’u’lláh wrote, “are, alas, blowing from every direction,
                     and the strife that divides and afflicts the human race is daily increasing. The signs
                     of impending convulsions and chaos can now be discerned, inasmuch as the prevailing
                     order appears to be lamentably defective.” This prophetic judgment has been amply
                     confirmed by the common experience of humanity. Flaws in the prevailing order are
                     conspicuous in the inability of sovereign states organized as United Nations to exorcise
                     the specter of war, the threatened collapse of the international economic order, the
                     spread of anarchy and terrorism, and the intense suffering which these and other afflictions
                     are causing to increasing millions. Indeed, so much have aggression and conflict come
                     to characterize our social, economic and religious systems, that many have succumbed
                     to the view that such behavior is intrinsic to human nature and therefore ineradicable.

                     <a id="070400689" class="brl-location"></a>With the entrenchment of this view, a paralyzing contradiction has developed in human
                     affairs. On the one hand, people of all nations proclaim not only their readiness
                     but their longing for peace and harmony, for an end to the harrowing apprehensions
                     tormenting their daily lives. On the other, uncritical assent is given to the proposition
                     that human beings are incorrigibly selfish and aggressive and thus incapable of erecting
                     a social system at once progressive and peaceful, dynamic and harmonious, a system
                     giving free play to individual creativity and initiative but based on cooperation
                     and reciprocity.

                     its realization, demands a reassessment of the assumptions upon which the commonly
                     held view of mankind’s historical predicament is based. Dispassionately examined,
                     the evidence reveals that such conduct, far from expressing man’s true self, represents
                     a distortion of the human spirit. Satisfaction on this point will enable all people
                     to set in motion constructive social forces which, because they are consistent with
                     human nature, will encourage harmony and cooperation instead of war and conflict.

                     Faith regards the current world confusion and calamitous condition in human affairs
                     as a natural phase in an organic process leading ultimately and irresistibly to the
                     unification of the human race in a single social order whose boundaries are those
                     of the planet. The human race, as a distinct, organic unit, has passed through evolutionary
                     stages analogous to the stages of infancy and childhood in the lives of its individual
                     members, and is now in the culminating period of its turbulent adolescence approaching
                     its long-awaited coming of age.

                     despair but a prerequisite to undertaking the stupendous enterprise of building a
                     peaceful world. That such an enterprise is possible, that the necessary constructive

                     this supreme trial with confidence in its ultimate outcome. Far from signalizing the
                     end of civilization, the convulsive changes towards which humanity is being ever more
                     rapidly impelled will serve to release the “potentialities inherent in the station

                     But such accomplishments alone have never satisfied the human spirit, whose mysterious

                     the ultimate reality, that unknowable essence of essences called God. The religions
                     brought to mankind by a succession of spiritual luminaries have been the primary link
                     between humanity and that ultimate reality, and have galvanized and refined mankind’s

                     religion. Man’s perception and practice of it are largely the stuff of history. An
                     eminent historian described religion as a “faculty of human nature.” That the perversion
                     of this faculty has contributed to much of the confusion in society and the conflicts
                     in and between individuals can hardly be denied. But neither can any fair-minded observer
                     discount the preponderating influence exerted by religion on the vital expressions
                     of civilization. Furthermore, its indispensability to social order has repeatedly
                     been demonstrated by its direct effect on laws and morality.

                     <a id="165655808" class="brl-location"></a>Writing of religion as a social force, Bahá’u’lláh said: “Religion is the greatest
                     of all means for the establishment of order in the world and for the peaceful contentment
                     of all that dwell therein.” Referring to the eclipse or corruption of religion, he
                     wrote: “Should the lamp of religion be obscured, chaos and confusion will ensue, and
                     the lights of fairness, of justice, of tranquillity and peace cease to shine.” In
                     an enumeration of such consequences the Bahá’í writings point out that the “perversion
                     of human nature, the degradation of human conduct, the corruption and dissolution
                     of human institutions, reveal themselves, under such circumstances, in their worst
                     and most revolting aspects. Human character is debased, confidence is shaken, the

                     Those who have held blindly and selfishly to their particular orthodoxies, who have

                     by the artificial barriers erected between faith and reason, science and religion.
                     For from a fair-minded examination of the actual utterances of the Founders of the
                     great religions, and of the social milieus in which they were obliged to carry out
                     their missions, there is nothing to support the contentions and prejudices deranging
                     the religious communities of mankind and therefore all human affairs.

                     the governments of the world can lend it. For ignorance is indisputably the principal
                     reason for the decline and fall of peoples and the perpetuation of prejudice. No nation
                     can achieve success unless education is accorded all its citizens. Lack of resources
                     limits the ability of many nations to fulfill this necessity, imposing a certain ordering
                     of priorities. The decision-making agencies involved would do well to consider giving
                     first priority to the education of women and girls, since it is through educated mothers
                     that the benefits of knowledge can be most effectively and rapidly diffused throughout
                     society. In keeping with the requirements of the times, consideration should also
                     be given to teaching the concept of world citizenship as part of the standard education
                     of every child.

                     <a id="740032521" class="brl-location"></a>A fundamental lack of communication between peoples seriously undermines efforts towards
                     world peace. Adopting an international auxiliary language would go far to resolve
                     this problem and necessitates the most urgent attention.

                     <a id="224779343" class="brl-location"></a>Two points bear emphasizing in all these issues. One is that the abolition of war
                     is not simply a matter of signing treaties and protocols; it is a complex task requiring
                     a new level of commitment to resolving issues not customarily associated with the
                     pursuit of peace. Based on political agreements alone, the idea of collective security
                     is a chimera. The other point is that the primary challenge in dealing with issues
                     of peace is to raise the context to the level of principle, as distinct from pure
                     pragmatism. For, in essence, peace stems from an inner state supported by a spiritual
                     or moral attitude, and it is chiefly in evoking this attitude that the possibility
                     of enduring solutions can be found.

                     <a id="335739753" class="brl-location"></a>There are spiritual principles, or what some call human values, by which solutions
                     can be found for every social problem. Any well-intentioned group can in a general
                     sense devise practical solutions to its problems, but good intentions and practical
                     knowledge are usually not enough. The essential merit of spiritual principle is that
                     it not only presents a perspective which harmonizes with that which is immanent in
                     human nature, it also induces an attitude, a dynamic, a will, an aspiration, which
                     facilitate the discovery and implementation of practical measures. Leaders of governments
                     and all in authority would be well served in their efforts to solve problems if they
                     would first seek to identify the principles involved and then be guided by them.

                     a spiritual truth which all the human sciences confirm. Anthropology, physiology,
                     psychology, recognize only one human species, albeit infinitely varied in the secondary
                     aspects of life. Recognition of this truth requires abandonment of prejudice—prejudice
                     of every kind—race, class, color, creed, nation, sex, degree of material civilization,
                     everything which enables people to consider themselves superior to others.

                     of this spiritual principle is essential to any successful attempt to establish world
                     peace. It should therefore be universally proclaimed, taught in schools, and constantly
                     asserted in every nation as preparation for the organic change in the structure of
                     society which it implies.

                     unified in all the essential aspects of its life, its political machinery, its spiritual
                     aspiration, its trade and finance, its script and language, and yet infinite in the

                     <a id="216610824" class="brl-location"></a>Elaborating the implications of this pivotal principle, Shoghi Effendi, the Guardian
                     of the Bahá’í Faith, commented in 1931 that: “Far from aiming at the subversion of
                     the existing foundations of society, it seeks to broaden its basis, to remold its
                     institutions in a manner consonant with the needs of an ever-changing world. It can
                     conflict with no legitimate allegiances, nor can it undermine essential loyalties.
                     Its purpose is neither to stifle the flame of a sane and intelligent patriotism in
                     men’s hearts, nor to abolish the system of national autonomy so essential if the evils
                     of excessive centralization are to be avoided. It does not ignore, nor does it attempt
                     to suppress, the diversity of ethnical origins, of climate, of history, of language
                     and tradition, of thought and habit, that differentiate the peoples and nations of
                     the world. It calls for a wider loyalty, for a larger aspiration than any that has
                     animated the human race. It insists upon the subordination of national impulses and
                     interests to the imperative claims of a unified world. It repudiates excessive centralization
                     on one hand, and disclaims all attempts at uniformity on the other. Its watchword
                     is unity in diversity.”

                     <a id="181441035" class="brl-location"></a>The achievement of such ends requires several stages in the adjustment of national
                     political attitudes, which now verge on anarchy in the absence of clearly defined
                     laws or universally accepted and enforceable principles regulating the relationships
                     between nations. The League of Nations, the United Nations, and the many organizations
                     and agreements produced by them have unquestionably been helpful in attenuating some
                     of the negative effects of international conflicts, but they have shown themselves
                     incapable of preventing war. Indeed, there have been scores of wars since the end
                     of the Second World War; many are yet raging.

                     <a id="008362030" class="brl-location"></a>The predominant aspects of this problem had already emerged in the nineteenth century
                     when Bahá’u’lláh first advanced his proposals for the establishment of world peace.
                     The principle of collective security was propounded by him in statements addressed
                     to the rulers of the world. Shoghi Effendi commented on his meaning: “What else could
                     these weighty words signify,” he wrote, “if they did not point to the inevitable curtailment
                     of unfettered national sovereignty as an indispensable preliminary to the formation
                     of the future Commonwealth of all the nations of the world? Some form of a world superstate
                     must needs be evolved, in whose favor all the nations of the world will have willingly
                     ceded every claim to make war, certain rights to impose taxation and all rights to
                     maintain armaments, except for purposes of maintaining internal order within their
                     respective dominions. Such a state will have to include within its orbit an international
                     executive adequate to enforce supreme and unchallengeable authority on every recalcitrant
                     member of the commonwealth; a world parliament whose members shall be elected by the
                     people in their respective countries and whose election shall be confirmed by their
                     respective governments; and a supreme tribunal whose judgment will have a binding
                     effect even in such cases where the parties concerned did not voluntarily agree to
                     submit their case to its consideration.

                     of religious fanaticism and strife will have been forever stilled; in which the flame
                     of racial animosity will have been finally extinguished; in which a single code of
                     international law—the product of the considered judgment of the world’s federated

                     the combined forces of the federated units; and finally a world community in which
                     the fury of a capricious and militant nationalism will have been transmuted into an
                     abiding consciousness of world citizenship—such indeed, appears, in its broadest outline,
                     the Order anticipated by Bahá’u’lláh, an Order that shall come to be regarded as the
                     fairest fruit of a slowly maturing age.”

                     <a id="584180280" class="brl-location"></a>The implementation of these far-reaching measures was indicated by Bahá’u’lláh: “The
                     time must come when the imperative necessity for the holding of a vast, an all-embracing
                     assemblage of men will be universally realized. The rulers and kings of the earth
                     must needs attend it, and, participating in its deliberations, must consider such
                     ways and means as will lay the foundations of the world’s Great Peace amongst men.”

                     <a id="347891062" class="brl-location"></a>The courage, the resolution, the pure motive, the selfless love of one people for
                     another—all the spiritual and moral qualities required for effecting this momentous
                     step towards peace are focused on the will to act. And it is towards arousing the
                     necessary volition that earnest consideration must be given to the reality of man,
                     namely, his thought. To understand the relevance of this potent reality is also to
                     appreciate the social necessity of actualizing its unique value through candid, dispassionate
                     and cordial consultation, and of acting upon the results of this process. Bahá’u’lláh
                     insistently drew attention to the virtues and indispensability of consultation for
                     ordering human affairs. He said: “Consultation bestows greater awareness and transmutes
                     conjecture into certitude. It is a shining light which, in a dark world, leads the
                     way and guides. For everything there is and will continue to be a station of perfection
                     and maturity. The maturity of the gift of understanding is made manifest through consultation.”
                     The very attempt to achieve peace through the consultative action he proposed can
                     release such a salutary spirit among the peoples of the earth that no power could
                     resist the final, triumphal outcome.

                     <a id="373695452" class="brl-location"></a>Concerning the proceedings for this world gathering, ‘Abdu’l‑Bahá, the son of Bahá’u’lláh
                     and authorized interpreter of his teachings, offered these insights: “They must make
                     the Cause of Peace the object of general consultation, and seek by every means in
                     their power to establish a Union of the nations of the world. They must conclude a
                     binding treaty and establish a covenant, the provisions of which shall be sound, inviolable
                     and definite. They must proclaim it to all the world and obtain for it the sanction
                     of all the human race. This supreme and noble undertaking—the real source of the peace
                     and well-being of all the world—should be regarded as sacred by all that dwell on
                     earth. All the forces of humanity must be mobilized to ensure the stability and permanence
                     of this Most Great Covenant. In this all-embracing Pact the limits and frontiers of
                     each and every nation should be clearly fixed, the principles underlying the relations
                     of governments towards one another definitely laid down, and all international agreements
                     and obligations ascertained. In like manner, the size of the armaments of every government
                     should be strictly limited, for if the preparations for war and the military forces
                     of any nation should be allowed to increase, they will arouse the suspicion of others.
                     The fundamental principle underlying this solemn Pact should be so fixed that if any
                     government later violate any one of its provisions, all the governments on earth should
                     arise to reduce it to utter submission, nay the human race as a whole should resolve,
                     with every power at its disposal, to destroy that government. Should this greatest
                     of all remedies be applied to the sick body of the world, it will assuredly recover
                     from its ills and will remain eternally safe and secure.”

                     fear of nuclear holocaust, beyond the political peace reluctantly entered into by

                     striving. Nation-building has come to an end. The anarchy inherent in state sovereignty
                     is moving towards a climax. A world, growing to maturity, must abandon this fetish,
                     recognize the oneness and wholeness of human relationships, and establish once for
                     all the machinery that can best incarnate this fundamental principle of its life.”

                     <a id="910323081" class="brl-location"></a>All contemporary forces of change validate this view. The proofs can be discerned
                     in the many examples already cited of the favorable signs towards world peace in current
                     international movements and developments. The army of men and women, drawn from virtually
                     every culture, race and nation on earth, who serve the multifarious agencies of the
                     United Nations, represent a planetary “civil service” whose impressive accomplishments
                     are indicative of the degree of cooperation that can be attained even under discouraging
                     conditions. An urge towards unity, like a spiritual springtime, struggles to express
                     itself through countless international congresses that bring together people from
                     a vast array of disciplines. It motivates appeals for international projects involving
                     children and youth. Indeed, it is the real source of the remarkable movement towards
                     ecumenism by which members of historically antagonistic religions and sects seem irresistibly
                     drawn towards one another. Together with the opposing tendency to warfare and self-aggrandizement
                     against which it ceaselessly struggles, the drive towards world unity is one of the
                     dominant, pervasive features of life on the planet during the closing years of the
                     twentieth century.

                     <a id="103410872" class="brl-location"></a>The experience of the Bahá’í community may be seen as an example of this enlarging
                     unity. It is a community of some three to four million people drawn from many nations,
                     cultures, classes and creeds, engaged in a wide range of activities serving the spiritual,
                     social and economic needs of the peoples of many lands. It is a single social organism,
                     representative of the diversity of the human family, conducting its affairs through
                     a system of commonly accepted consultative principles, and cherishing equally all
                     the great outpourings of divine guidance in human history. Its existence is yet another
                     convincing proof of the practicality of its Founder’s vision of a united world, another
                     evidence that humanity can live as one global society, equal to whatever challenges
                     its coming of age may entail. If the Bahá’í experience can contribute in whatever
                     measure to reinforcing hope in the unity of the human race, we are happy to offer
                     it as a model for study.

                     <a id="594856996" class="brl-location"></a>In contemplating the supreme importance of the task now challenging the entire world,
                     we bow our heads in humility before the awesome majesty of the divine Creator, who
                     out of His infinite love has created all humanity from the same stock; exalted the
                     gemlike reality of man; honored it with intellect and wisdom, nobility and immortality;
                     and conferred upon man the “unique distinction and capacity to know Him and to love
                     Him,” a capacity that “must needs be regarded as the generating impulse and the primary
                     purpose underlying the whole of creation.”

                     <a id="001700867" class="brl-location"></a>We hold firmly the conviction that all human beings have been created “to carry forward
                     an ever-advancing civilization”; that “to act like the beasts of the field is unworthy
                     of man”; that the virtues that befit human dignity are trustworthiness, forbearance,
                     mercy, compassion and loving-kindness towards all peoples. We reaffirm the belief
                     that the “potentialities inherent in the station of man, the full measure of his destiny
                     on earth, the innate excellence of his reality, must all be manifested in this promised
                     Day of God.” These are the motivations for our unshakable faith that unity and peace
                     are the attainable goal towards which humanity is striving.

                     they still endure in the land in which their Faith was born. By their example of steadfast
                     hope, they bear witness to the belief that the imminent realization of this age-old
                     dream of peace is now, by virtue of the transforming effects of Bahá’u’lláh’s revelation,
                     invested with the force of divine authority. Thus we convey to you not only a vision
                     in words: we summon the power of deeds of faith and sacrifice; we convey the anxious
                     plea of our coreligionists everywhere for peace and unity. We join with all who are
                     the victims of aggression, all who yearn for an end to conflict and contention, all
                     whose devotion to principles of peace and world order promotes the ennobling purposes
                     for which humanity was called into being by an all-loving Creator.
