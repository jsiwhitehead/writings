                     <a id="398791792" class="brl-location"></a>From the birth of the Bahá’í Revelation in a subterranean dungeon in Ṭihrán where
                     its Author was confined in 1852, the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh has rapidly grown, in ever-widening
                     circles, beyond the social and religious matrix of its inception. Among the first
                     individuals outside the Islamic community to be attracted to its teachings, presaging
                     the flow of people of all faiths and origins into its universal embrace, were Zoroastrians
                     in Persia and India. To this group Bahá’u’lláh addressed a number of Tablets, several
                     of which are presented here for the first time in full authorized translations.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <a id="423232441" class="brl-location"></a>Prominent among these works is Bahá’u’lláh’s Tablet to Mánik<u>ch</u>í Ṣáḥib. Mánik<u>ch</u>í Limjí Hataria (1813–1890), also known as Mánik<u>ch</u>í (Manekji) Ṣáḥib, was born in India of Zoroastrian parents. An able diplomat and
                     devoted adherent of his ancestral religion, Mánik<u>ch</u>í Ṣáḥib was appointed, in 1854, as an emissary on behalf of the Parsees of India to
                     assist their coreligionists in Iran, who were suffering under the repressive policies
                     of the Qájár monarchs. Some time after this he attained the presence of Bahá’u’lláh
                     in Baghdad. Although maintaining to the end of his life allegiance to his Zoroastrian
                     faith, he was attracted to the teachings of the new religion and, moved by the sacrifice
                     of its early martyrs, became a lifelong admirer. Years after their meeting he posed
                     a series of questions to Bahá’u’lláh which led to the revelation of two Tablets of
                     far-reaching significance, the first of which was sent to him in 1878.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <a id="208423093" class="brl-location"></a>The first Tablet, known as the Lawḥ-i-Mánik<u>ch</u>í Ṣáḥib, is celebrated for its striking and well-known passages epitomizing the universality
                     of Bahá’u’lláh’s prophetic claim. Revealed, at Mánik<u>ch</u>í Ṣáḥib’s bold request, in pure Persian, the Tablet responds to the questions he had
                     raised and proclaims some of the central tenets of the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh: “Be anxiously
                     concerned with the needs of the age ye live in, and centre your deliberations on its
                     exigencies and requirements.” “Turn your faces from the darkness of estrangement to
                     the effulgent light of the daystar of unity.” “Ye are the fruits of one tree, and
                     the leaves of one branch.” “[W]hatsoever leadeth to the decline of ignorance and the
                     increase of knowledge hath been, and will ever remain, approved in the sight of the
                     Lord of creation.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <a id="664121736" class="brl-location"></a>As inferred from the contents of a second Tablet, Mánik<u>ch</u>í Ṣáḥib was not entirely satisfied with this reply, having anticipated a more expansive
                     discussion of his specific questions. Bahá’u’lláh’s further reply is contained in
                     a lengthy Tablet, revealed on 14 <u>Sh</u>a‘bán 1299 (1 July 1882) in the voice of His amanuensis Mírzá Áqá Ján. The Tablet
                     is addressed to the eminent Bahá’í scholar Abu’l-Faḍl, who at the time was employed
                     as the personal secretary of Mánik<u>ch</u>í Ṣáḥib, but a lengthy portion of it addresses the latter’s questions. Bahá’u’lláh
                     states at the outset that he had “failed to consider the matter closely, for otherwise
                     he would have readily admitted that not a single point was omitted”, and explains
                     that out of wisdom his questions had not been directly answered, but that even so,
                     “the answers were provided in a language of marvellous concision and clarity”. Throughout
                     the remainder of the Tablet, the text of each of Mánik<u>ch</u>í Ṣáḥib’s questions is successively quoted and detailed replies are given to each,
                     in some cases connecting the questions to the universal principles enunciated in the
                     first Tablet.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <a id="232697431" class="brl-location"></a>The Tablet is noteworthy for its discussion of a range of questions regarding the
                     tenets of both Abrahamic and non-Abrahamic religions, as understood by Mánik<u>ch</u>í Ṣáḥib, including the nature of creation, the connection between faith and reason,
                     the reconciliation of the differences that exist among the laws and ordinances of
                     various religions, their respective claims to exclusivity and their differing degrees
                     of eagerness to welcome others into their fold. Bahá’u’lláh’s responses emphasize
                     that which is right and true in the various doctrines and beliefs under examination,
                     rather than discarding them outright for inaccuracy or insufficiency. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <a id="778914035" class="brl-location"></a>Included here as well with these two major works are the Lawḥ-i-Haft Pursi<u>sh</u> (Tablet of the Seven Questions), addressed to Ustád Javán-Mard, a prominent early
                     Bahá’í of Zoroastrian background and former student of Mánik<u>ch</u>í Ṣáḥib, and two other Tablets also revealed to believers of the same origin. Together,
                     these five Tablets offer a glimpse of Bahá’u’lláh’s love for, and special relationship
                     with, the followers of a religion that had arisen, many centuries before, in the same
                     land that witnessed the birth of His own Faith.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <a id="356040308" class="brl-location"></a>A portion of the Lawḥ-i-Mánik<u>ch</u>í Ṣáḥib and several excerpts from the other Tablets were previously translated by
                     Shoghi Effendi; these have been incorporated into the text of the translations and
                     listed in the appendix.

                     <a id="183504544" class="brl-location"></a>It is hoped that the publication of this volume will enable a deeper appreciation
                     of the fundamental principle of the oneness of religion and lend a fresh impetus to
                     the efforts of those who strive to promote its understanding in an age that needs
                     it more acutely with every passing day.

                     <span class="brl-uppercase">Praise</span> be to the all-perceiving, the ever-abiding Lord Who, from a dewdrop out of the ocean
                     of His grace, hath reared the firmament of existence, adorned it with the stars of
                     knowledge, and admitted man into the lofty court of insight and understanding. This
                     dewdrop, which is the Primal Word of God, is at times called the Water of Life, inasmuch
                     as it quickeneth with the waters of knowledge them that have perished in the wilderness
                     of ignorance. Again it is called the Primal Light, a light born of the Sun of divine
                     knowledge, through whose effulgence the first stirrings of existence were made plain
                     and manifest. Such manifestations are the expressions of the grace of Him Who is the
                     Peerless, the All-Wise. He it is who knoweth and bestoweth all. He it is who transcendeth
                     all that hath been said or heard. His knowledge will remain forever above the grasp
                     of human vision and understanding and beyond the reach of human words and deeds. To
                     the truth of this utterance existence itself and all that hath appeared therefrom
                     bear eloquent testimony.

                     its discoverer and recipient is the power of understanding. This Word is the foremost

                     All that is seen is visible only through the light of its wisdom. All that is manifest
                     is but a token of its knowledge. All names are but its name, and the beginning and
                     end of all matters must needs depend upon it.

                     can never be the same as that which a subsequent age may require. Be anxiously concerned

                     to take undue pleasure in one’s own words and deeds, however worthy they may be. True
                     peace and tranquillity will only be realized when every soul will have become the

                     never be deprived of their portion of the ocean of His bounty. In the firmament of

                     This is that which above all else will benefit the peoples of the earth. O friend!

                     the same One that appeared in the beginning.’ The latter Prophets such as David, Abraham,
                     Moses and Jesus confirmed the truth of the Prophets gone before them, but said: ‘Such
                     was the law in the past, but in this day the law is that which I proclaim.’ The Arabian
                     Prophet, however, hath said: ‘Through My appearance every law hath proven to be unsound
                     and no law holdeth but Mine.’ Which of these creeds is acceptable and which of these
                     leaders is to be preferred?” 
                  </p>

                     <a id="623413460" class="brl-location"></a>It should first be noted that in one sense the stations of the Prophets of God differ
                     one from another. For instance, consider Moses. He brought forth a Book and established
                     ordinances, whilst a number of the Prophets and Messengers who arose after Him were
                     charged with the promulgation of His laws, insofar as they remained consonant with
                     the needs of the age. The books and chronicles annexed to the Torah bear eloquent
                     testimony to this truth.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <a class="brl-pnum">2.4</a>
                     <a id="079574805" class="brl-location"></a>Regarding the statement ascribed to the Author of the Qur’án: “Through My appearance
                     every law and religion hath proven to be unsound and no law holdeth but Mine”, no
                     such words were ever uttered by that Source and Fount of divine wisdom. Nay rather,
                     He confirmed that which had been sent down before from the empyrean of the Divine
                     Will unto the Prophets and Messengers of God. He saith, exalted be His utterance:
                     “Alif. Lám. Mím. God! There is no God but Him, the Living, the Ever-Abiding. He it
                     is Who hath sent down to Thee the Book through the power of truth, confirming those
                     which preceded it. He revealed aforetime the Torah and the Evangel as a guidance unto
                     men, and He hath now revealed the Qur’án….”<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#078045554">4</a></sup> He, moreover, hath asserted that all the Prophets have proceeded from God and have
                     returned unto Him. Viewed in this light, they are all as one and the same Being, inasmuch
                     as they have not uttered a word, brought a message, or revealed a cause, of their
                     own accord. Nay, all that they have said hath proceeded from the one true God, exalted
                     be His glory. They have all summoned men unto the Supreme Horizon and imparted the
                     tidings of eternal life. Thus the diverse statements recounted by his honour the Ṣáḥib
                     are to be seen as concordant letters, that is, letters that form a single word.

                     <a id="710717797" class="brl-location"></a>Concerning the question: “Which of these creeds is acceptable and which of these leaders
                     is to be preferred?”, this is the station wherein the following blessed words shine
                     resplendent as the sun: “No distinction do We make between any of the Messengers”,<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#046218134">5</a></sup> while the verse “Some of the Apostles We have caused to excel the others”<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#761970797">6</a></sup> pertaineth to the other station of which We have already made mention. Indeed, the
                     answer to all that his honour the Ṣáḥib hath asked lieth enshrined within this all-embracing,
                     this weighty and incomparable utterance, hallowed and exalted be His word: “As to
                     thy question concerning the heavenly Scriptures: The All-Knowing Physician hath His
                     finger on the pulse of mankind. He perceiveth the disease, and prescribeth, in His
                     unerring wisdom, the remedy. Every age hath its own problem, and every soul its particular
                     aspiration. The remedy the world needeth in its present-day afflictions can never
                     be the same as that which a subsequent age may require. Be anxiously concerned with
                     the needs of the age ye live in, and centre your deliberations on its exigencies and
                     requirements.”<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#749140829">7</a></sup> Every fair-minded soul will testify that these words are to be viewed as a mirror
                     of the knowledge of God, wherein all that hath been inquired is clearly and conspicuously
                     reflected. Blessed is he who hath been endowed with seeing eyes by God, the All-Knowing,
                     the All-Wise.

                     <a class="brl-pnum">2.6</a>
                     <a id="832077725" class="brl-location"></a>Another question raised by the distinguished Ṣáḥib is the following: “There are four
                     schools of thought in the world. One school affirmeth that all the visible worlds,
                     from atoms to suns, constitute God Himself and that naught can be seen but Him. Another
                     school claimeth that God is that Essence that must of necessity exist, that His Messengers
                     are the intermediaries between Him and His creatures, and that their mission is to
                     lead humanity unto Him. Yet another school holdeth that the stars were created by
                     the Necessary Being,<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#797293698">8</a></sup> whilst all other things are their effect and outcome. These things continually appear
                     and disappear, even as the minute creatures that are generated in a pool of water.
                     A further school maintaineth that the Necessary Being hath fashioned Nature through
                     whose effect and agency all things, from atoms to suns, appear and disappear without
                     beginning or end. What need then for an account or reckoning? As the grass groweth
                     with the coming of the rain and vanisheth thereafter, so it is with all things. If
                     the Prophets and the kings have instituted laws and ordinances, the proponents of
                     this school argue, this hath merely been for the sake of preserving the civil order
                     and regulating human society. The Prophets and the kings, however, have acted in different
                     ways: the former have said ‘God hath spoken thus’ that the people might submit and
                     obey, whilst the latter have resorted to the sword and the cannon. Which of these
                     four schools is approved in the sight of God?”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <a class="brl-pnum">2.7</a>
                     <a id="638610190" class="brl-location"></a>The answer to all this falleth under the purview of the first utterance that hath
                     streamed forth from the tongue of the All-Merciful. By God! It embraceth and comprehendeth
                     all that hath been mentioned. He saith: “Be anxiously concerned with the needs of
                     the age ye live in, and centre your deliberations on its exigencies and requirements”.
                     For in this day He Who is the Lord of Revelation hath appeared and He Who spoke on
                     Sinai is calling aloud. Whatsoever He may ordain is the surest foundation for the
                     mansions reared in the cities of human knowledge and wisdom. Whoso holdeth fast unto
                     it will be reckoned in the eyes of the Almighty among them that are endued with insight.

                     <a class="brl-pnum">2.8</a>
                     <a id="384392688" class="brl-location"></a>These sublime words have streamed forth from the Pen of the Most High. He saith, exalted
                     be His glory: “This is the day of vision, for the countenance of God is shining resplendent
                     above the horizon of Manifestation. This is the day of hearing, for the call of God
                     hath been raised. It behoveth everyone in this day to uphold and proclaim that which
                     hath been revealed by Him Who is the Author of all scripture, the Dayspring of revelation,
                     the Fount of knowledge and the Source of divine wisdom.” It is thus clear and evident
                     that the reply to his question hath been revealed in the kingdom of utterance by Him
                     Who is the Exponent of the knowledge of the All-Merciful. Happy are they that understand!
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <a class="brl-pnum">2.9</a>
                     <a id="219006846" class="brl-location"></a>As to the four schools mentioned above, it is clear and evident that the second standeth
                     closer to righteousness.<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#330368176">9</a></sup> For the Apostles and Messengers of God have ever been the channels of His abounding
                     grace, and whatsoever man hath received from God hath been through the intermediary
                     of those Embodiments of holiness and Essences of detachment, those Repositories of
                     His knowledge and Exponents of His Cause. One can, however, provide a justification
                     for the tenets of the other schools, for in a sense all things have ever been and
                     shall ever remain the manifestations of the names and attributes of God.
                  </p>

                     <a id="080563009" class="brl-location"></a>As to the Ṣáḥib’s reference to the kings, they are indeed the manifestations of the
                     name of God “the Almighty” and the revealers of His name “the All-Powerful”. The vesture
                     that beseemeth their glorious temples is justice. Should they become adorned therewith,
                     mankind will partake of perfect tranquillity and infinite blessings.

                     <a id="855801133" class="brl-location"></a>Whoso hath quaffed of the wine of divine knowledge will indeed be able to answer such
                     questions with clear and perspicuous proofs from the world without and with manifest
                     and luminous evidences from the world within. A different Cause, however, hath appeared
                     in this day and a different discourse is required. Indeed, with the inception of the
                     year nine the time for questions and answers came to an end. Thus He, hallowed and
                     magnified be His name, saith: “This is not the day for any man to question his Lord.
                     When thou hearest the call of God voiced by Him Who is the Dayspring of grandeur,
                     cry out: ‘Here am I, O Lord of all names! Here am I, O Maker of the heavens! I testify
                     that Thou hast revealed Thyself and hast revealed whatsoever Thou didst desire at
                     Thine Own behest. Thou, in truth, art the Lord of strength and might.’”

                  <p>
                     <a class="brl-pnum">2.12</a>
                     <a id="310183638" class="brl-location"></a>The answer to all that the distinguished Ṣáḥib hath asked is clear and evident. The
                     intent of that which was sent down in his honour from the heaven of divine providence
                     was that he might give ear to the wondrous melodies of the Dove of Eternity and the
                     gentle murmuring of the inhabitants of the most exalted Paradise, and that he might
                     perceive the sweetness of the call and set foot upon the path. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <a class="brl-pnum">2.13</a>
                     <a id="035979959" class="brl-location"></a>One day the Tongue of Glory uttered a word in regard to the Ṣáḥib indicating that
                     he may erelong be aided to perform a deed that would immortalize his name. When his
                     letter was received in His holy and exalted Court, He said: “O Servant in attendance!
                     Although his honour Mánik<u>ch</u>í hath written only to ask concerning the sayings of others, yet from His letter We
                     inhale the sweet savours of affection. Beseech the one true God to graciously aid
                     him to do His will and pleasure. His might, in truth, is equal to all things.” From
                     this utterance of the All-Merciful there wafteth a fragrant breath. He, verily, is
                     the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.

                     <a id="702720675" class="brl-location"></a>Another inquiry made by him is the following: “The laws of Islam are based on religious
                     principles and jurisprudence,<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#515061609">10</a></sup> but in the Mahábád and Hindu religions there are only principles, and all laws, even
                     those regarding the drinking of water or giving and taking in marriage, are considered
                     a part of these principles, as are all other matters of human life. Kindly indicate
                     which view is acceptable in the sight of God, exalted be His mention.”

                  <p>
                     <a class="brl-pnum">2.15</a>
                     <a id="381148358" class="brl-location"></a>Religious principles have various degrees and stations. The root of all principles
                     and the cornerstone of all foundations hath ever been, and shall remain, the recognition
                     of God. And these days are indeed the vernal season of the recognition of the All-Merciful.
                     Whatsoever proceedeth in this day from the Repository of His Cause and the Manifestation
                     of His Self is, in truth, the fundamental principle unto which all must bear allegiance.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <a class="brl-pnum">2.16</a>
                     <a id="515594870" class="brl-location"></a>The answer to this question is also embodied in these blessed, these weighty and exalted
                     words: “Be anxiously concerned with the needs of the age ye live in, and centre your
                     deliberations on its exigencies and requirements”. For this day is the Lord of all
                     days, and whatsoever hath been revealed therein by the Source of divine Revelation
                     is the truth and the essence of all principles. This day may be likened to a sea and
                     all other days to gulfs and channels that have branched therefrom. That which is uttered
                     and revealed in this day is the foundation, and is accounted as the Mother Book and
                     the Source of all utterance. Although every day is associated with God, magnified
                     be His glory, yet these days have been singled out and adorned with the ornament of
                     intimate association with Him, for they have been extolled in the books of the Chosen
                     Ones of God, as well as of some of His Prophets, as the “Day of God”. In a sense this
                     day and that which appeareth therein are to be regarded as the primary principles,
                     while all other days and whatsoever appeareth in them are to be viewed as the secondary
                     ordinances deduced therefrom, and which as such are subordinate and relative. For
                     instance, attending the mosque is secondary with respect to the recognition of God,
                     for the former is dependent upon and conditioned by the latter. As to the principles
                     current amongst the divines of this age, these are merely a set of rules which they
                     have devised and from which they infer, each according to his own opinions and inclinations,
                     the ordinances of God.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <a class="brl-pnum">2.17</a>
                     <a id="262132997" class="brl-location"></a>Consider for example the question of immediate compliance or postponement. God, exalted
                     be His glory, saith: “Eat and drink….”<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#416575765">11</a></sup> Now, it is not known whether this ordinance must be complied with immediately or
                     if its execution may be justifiably postponed. Some believe that it may be decided
                     by external circumstances. Once one of the distinguished divines of Najaf set out
                     to visit the Shrine of Imám Ḥusayn, peace be upon Him, accompanied by a number of
                     his pupils. In the course of their journey they were waylaid by a group of Bedouin.
                     The aforementioned divine immediately handed over all his possessions. Whereupon his
                     pupils exclaimed: “Your eminence hath always favoured postponement in such matters.
                     What prompteth you now to act with such haste?” Pointing to the spears of the Bedouin,
                     he replied: “The force of external circumstances, my friends!”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <a class="brl-pnum">2.18</a>
                     <a id="470544284" class="brl-location"></a>The founder of the principles of Islamic jurisprudence was Abú-Ḥanífih, who was a
                     prominent leader of the Sunnis. Such principles had existed in former times as well,
                     as hath already been mentioned. In this day, however, the approval or rejection of
                     all things dependeth wholly upon the Word of God. These differences are not worthy
                     of mention. The eye of divine mercy casteth its glance upon all that is past. It behoveth

                     <a id="663648202" class="brl-location"></a>Intellect hath various degrees. As a discussion of the pronouncements made by the
                     philosophers in this connection would pass beyond the scope of our discourse, we have
                     refrained from mentioning them. It is nonetheless indisputably clear and evident that
                     the minds of men have never been, nor shall they ever be, of equal capacity. The Perfect
                     Intellect alone can provide true guidance and direction. Thus were these sublime words
                     revealed by the Pen of the Most High, exalted be His glory, in response to this question:
                     “The Tongue of Wisdom proclaimeth: He that hath Me not is bereft of all things. Turn
                     ye away from all that is on earth and seek none else but Me. I am the Sun of Wisdom
                     and the Ocean of Knowledge. I cheer the faint and revive the dead. I am the guiding
                     Light that illumineth the way. I am the royal Falcon on the arm of the Almighty. I
                     unfold the drooping wings of every broken bird and start it on its flight.”<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#680177371">14</a></sup>

                     <a id="310087080" class="brl-location"></a>Consider how clearly the answer hath been revealed from the heaven of divine knowledge.
                     Blessed are those who ponder it, who reflect upon it, and who apprehend its meaning!
                     By the Intellect mentioned above is meant the universal divine Mind. How often hath
                     it been observed that certain human minds, far from being a source of guidance, have
                     become as fetters upon the feet of the wayfarers and prevented them from treading
                     the straight Path! The lesser intellect being thus circumscribed, one must search
                     after Him Who is the ultimate Source of knowledge and strive to recognize Him. And
                     should one come to acknowledge that Source round Whom every mind doth revolve, then
                     whatsoever He should ordain is the expression of the dictates of a consummate wisdom.
                     His very Being, even as the sun, is distinct from all else beside Him. The whole duty
                     of man is to recognize Him; once this hath been achieved, then whatsoever He may please
                     to ordain is binding and in full accordance with the requirements of divine wisdom.
                     Thus have ordinances and prohibitions of every kind been laid down by the Prophets
                     of the past, even unto the earliest times.

                     Indeed, should any soul breathe but a fleeting breath for the sake of God, his recompense
                     will become manifest, as attested by this mighty verse which was sent down from the

                     hath ever been and shall ever remain with Him. Every fair-minded soul, moreover, will
                     testify that whosoever faileth to embrace the truth of this most great Revelation
                     will find himself powerless and incapable of establishing the validity of any other
                     cause or creed. And as to those who have deprived themselves of the robe of justice
                     and arisen to promote the cause of iniquity, they shall give voice to that which the
                     exponents of hatred and fanaticism have uttered from time immemorial. The knowledge
                     of all things is with God, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.

                     say: ‘Matters have come to such a pass that the people of the world have grown accustomed
                     to iniquity and flee from fair-mindedness. A divine Manifestation Who hath extolled
                     and magnified the one true God, exalted be His glory, Who hath borne witness to His
                     knowledge and confessed that His Essence is sanctified above all things and exalted
                     beyond every comparison—such a Manifestation hath been called at various times a worshipper
                     of the sun or a fire-worshipper. How numerous are those sublime Manifestations and
                     Revealers of the Divine of Whose stations the people remain wholly unaware, of Whose
                     grace they are utterly deprived, nay, God forbid, Whom they curse and revile!’

                     <a id="731711403" class="brl-location"></a>‘One of the great Prophets Whom the foolish ones of Persia in this day reject uttered
                     these sublime words: “The sun is but a dense and spherical mass. It deserveth not
                     to be called God or the Almighty. For the almighty Lord is He Whom no human comprehension
                     can ever conceive, Whom no earthly knowledge can circumscribe, and Whose Essence none
                     hath ever been or shall ever be able to fathom”. Consider how eloquently, how solemnly
                     He hath affirmed the very truth that God is proclaiming in this day. And yet He is
                     not even deemed a believer by these abject and foolish ones, let alone seen as possessed
                     of a sublime station! In another connection He said: “All existence hath appeared
                     from His existence, and were it not for God, no creature would have ever existed and
                     been attired with the raiment of being”. May the Lord shield us all from the wickedness
                     of such as have disputed the truth of God and of His loved ones and turned away from
                     that Dayspring whereunto all the Books of God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting,
                     have testified.’”

                     criterion of truth. The truly wise are, in the first place, the Chosen Ones of God,
                     magnified be His glory—they Whom He hath singled out to be the Treasuries of His knowledge,
                     the Repositories of His Revelation, the Daysprings of His authority and the Dawning-places
                     of His wisdom, they Whom He hath made His representatives on earth and through Whom
                     He revealeth that which He hath purposed. Whoso turneth unto them hath turned unto
                     God, and whoso turneth away shall not be remembered in the presence of God, the All-Knowing,
                     the All-Wise.

                     <a id="523602976" class="brl-location"></a>The universal criterion is that which hath just been mentioned. Whosoever attaineth
                     thereunto, that is, who recognizeth and acknowledgeth the Dawning-place of God’s Revelation,
                     will be recorded in the Book of God among them that are endued with understanding.
                     Otherwise he is naught but an ignorant soul, though he believe himself to be possessed
                     of every wisdom. Now, were a person to see himself standing in the presence of God,
                     were he to sanctify his soul from earthly attachments and evil intentions, and reflect
                     upon that which hath been revealed in this most great Revelation from its inception
                     to this day, he would readily testify that every detached soul, every perfect mind,
                     sanctified being, attentive ear, penetrating eye, eloquent tongue, and joyous and
                     radiant heart circleth round and boweth down, nay prostrateth itself in submission,
                     before the mighty throne of God.

                     in His time, allowed the eating of beef while another hath forbidden it; one hath
                     permitted the eating of pork whereas another hath proscribed it. Thus do their ordinances
                     differ. I entreat the True One, exalted be His name, to graciously specify the appropriate
                     religious prohibitions.”

                  <p>

                     <a id="963019440" class="brl-location"></a>A direct reply and detailed explanation of this matter would have overstepped the
                     bounds of wisdom, inasmuch as people of diverse faiths associate with the distinguished
                     Ṣáḥib and a direct reply would have contravened the laws of Islam. The answer was
                     therefore sent down from the heaven of the Divine Will in an implicit manner. Indeed
                     the statement in the first passage where He saith: “The All-Knowing Physician hath
                     His finger on the pulse of mankind” was, and remaineth, the answer to his question.
                     He further saith: “Be anxiously concerned with the needs of the age ye live in, and
                     centre your deliberations on its exigencies and requirements.” That is, fix your gaze
                     upon the commandments of God, for whatsoever He should ordain in this day and pronounce
                     as lawful is indeed lawful and representeth the very truth. It is incumbent upon all
                     to turn their gaze towards the Cause of God and to observe that which hath dawned
                     above the horizon of His Will, since it is through the potency of His name that the
                     banner of “He doeth what He willeth” hath been unfurled and the standard of “He ordaineth
                     what He pleaseth” hath been raised aloft. For instance, were He to pronounce water
                     itself to be unlawful, it would indeed become unlawful, and the converse holdeth equally
                     true. For upon no thing hath it been inscribed “this is lawful” or “this is unlawful”;
                     nay rather, whatsoever hath been or will be revealed is by virtue of the Word of God,
                     exalted be His glory.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <a class="brl-pnum">2.32</a>
                     <a id="857157045" class="brl-location"></a>These matters are sufficiently clear and require no further elaboration. Even so,
                     certain groups believe that all the ordinances current amongst them are unalterable,
                     that they have ever been valid, and that they will forever remain so. Consider a further
                     passage, glorified and exalted be He: “These words are being uttered in due measure,
                     that the newly born may thrive and the tender shoot flourish. Milk must be given in
                     suitable proportion, that the children of the world may attain to the station of maturity
                     and abide in the court of oneness.”<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#400449428">17</a></sup> For instance, some believe that wine hath ever been and shall remain forbidden. Now,
                     were one to inform them that it might one day be made lawful, they would arise in
                     protest and opposition. In truth, the people of the world have yet not grasped the
                     meaning of “He doeth whatsoever He willeth”, nor have they comprehended the significance
                     of Supreme Infallibility. The suckling child must be nourished with milk. If it be
                     given meat it will assuredly perish, and this would be naught but sheer injustice
                     and unwisdom. Blessed are they that understand. Supreme Infallibility, as I once heard
                     from His blessed lips, is reserved exclusively to the Manifestations of the Cause
                     of God and the Exponents of His Revelation. This matter is mentioned but briefly,
                     for time is short and as scarce as the legendary phoenix.

                     <a id="976151163" class="brl-location"></a>Yet another question: “According to the teachings of the Mahábád and Hindu religions,
                     should a person of whatever faith or nation, of whatever colour, appearance, character
                     or condition, be disposed to associate with you, ye should show forth kindness and
                     treat him as a brother. But in other religions this is not so: their followers ill-treat
                     and oppress the adherents of other faiths, consider their persecution as an act of
                     worship, and regard their kindred and their possessions as lawful unto themselves.
                     Which approach is acceptable in the sight of God?”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <a class="brl-pnum">2.34</a>
                     <a id="199074266" class="brl-location"></a>The former statement hath ever been and will continue to be true. It is not permissible
                     to contend with anyone, nor is it acceptable in the sight of God to ill-treat or oppress
                     any soul. Time and again have these sublime words streamed from the Pen of the Most
                     High, blessed and exalted be He: “O ye children of men! The fundamental purpose animating
                     the Faith of God and His Religion is to safeguard the interests and promote the unity
                     of the human race, and to foster the spirit of love and fellowship amongst men. Suffer
                     it not to become a source of dissension and discord, of hate and enmity”. This subject
                     hath already been set forth and explained in various Tablets.

                     recognizing Him, his name shall be recorded in the Crimson Book among the inmates
                     of the all-highest Paradise. Should a soul fail, however, to accept the truth, it
                     is in no wise permissible to contend with him. In another connection He saith: “Blessed
                     and happy is he that ariseth to promote the best interests of the peoples and kindreds
                     of the earth.” Likewise He saith: “The people of Bahá should soar high above the peoples
                     of the world.” In matters of religion every form of fanaticism, hatred, dissension
                     and strife is strictly forbidden.

                     amongst His servants are consumed, the manifold pursuits of men are harmonized, and
                     mankind is illumined by the light of divine unity and enabled to turn towards the
                     Dayspring of divine knowledge: “The incomparable Friend saith: The path to freedom
                     hath been outstretched; hasten ye thereunto. The wellspring of wisdom is overflowing;
                     quaff ye therefrom. Say: O well-beloved ones! The tabernacle of unity hath been raised;
                     regard ye not one another as strangers. Ye are the fruits of one tree, and the leaves
                     of one branch.”<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#654913424">18</a></sup>

                     receive the reward of his actions, inasmuch as the peace and prosperity of the world
                     depend thereon, even as He saith, exalted be His glory: “The structure of world stability

                     partaketh of the bread of heaven to inform and invite his friends with the utmost
                     love and kindness. If they respond favourably, his object is attained; otherwise he
                     should leave them to themselves without contending with them or uttering a word that

                     This runneth counter to the purpose underlying the advent of the Messengers of God
                     and to that which hath been revealed in their Books. For those Who have appeared at
                     God’s behest have been entrusted with the guidance and education of all people. How

                     to this truth. In their time they summoned, with burning zeal, all the inhabitants

                     the utmost effort in teaching their faith. Their church organizations have an expenditure
                     of about thirty million. Their missionaries have scattered far and wide throughout
                     the globe and are assiduously engaged in teaching Christianity. Thus have they compassed
                     the world. How numerous the schools and churches they have founded to instruct children,
                     yet their unavowed aim is that these children, as they acquire an education, may also
                     become acquainted in their early years with the Gospel of Jesus Christ, and that the
                     unsullied mirrors of their hearts may thus reflect that which their teachers have
                     purposed. Indeed the followers of no other religion are as intent upon the propagation
                     of their faith as the Christians.

                     which was mentioned at the outset. All men have been called into being for the betterment
                     of the world. It behoveth every soul to arise and serve his brethren for the sake
                     of God. Should a brother of his embrace the truth, he should rejoice that the latter
                     hath attained unto everlasting favour. Otherwise he should implore God to guide him
                     without manifesting the least trace of animosity or ill-feeling towards him. The reins
                     of command are in the grasp of God. He doeth what He willeth and ordaineth as He pleaseth.
                     He, verily, is the Almighty, the All-Praised.

                     Whose unerring wisdom pervadeth all things and that we may acknowledge His truth.
                     For once one hath recognized Him and borne witness to His Reality, one will no longer
                     be troubled by the idle fancies and vain imaginings of men. The divine Physician hath
                     the pulse of mankind within His almighty grasp. At one time He may well deem fit to
                     sever certain infected limbs, that the disease may not spread to other parts of the
                     body. This would be the very essence of mercy and compassion, and to none is given

                     faith and religion is superior to every other. The other Prophets and the religions
                     they have instituted are true, but they occupy different stations before God, even
                     as, in the court of a king, there is a gradation of ranks from the prime minister
                     to the common soldier. Whosoever wisheth, let him keep the precepts of his religion.’
                     Nor do they impose upon any soul. The Hindus claim that whosoever partaketh of meat,
                     for whatever reason or under whatever circumstances, shall never catch a glimpse of
                     Paradise. The followers of Muḥammad, Jesus and Moses maintain that a similar fate
                     awaiteth those who fail to bear allegiance to their religions. Which belief is favoured
                     by God, glorified be His mention?”

                     <a id="070159104" class="brl-location"></a>Regarding their statement that “our faith and religion is superior to every other”,
                     by this is meant such Prophets as have appeared before them. Viewed from one perspective
                     these holy Souls are one: the first among them is the same as the last, and the last
                     is the same as the first. All have proceeded from God, unto Him have they summoned
                     all men, and unto Him have they returned. This theme hath been set forth in the Book
                     of Certitude, which is indeed the cynosure of all books, and which streamed from the
                     Pen of Glory in the early years of this Most Great Revelation. Blessed is he that
                     hath beheld it and pondered its contents for the love of God, the Lord of creation.

                     <a id="330466938" class="brl-location"></a>Concerning the remark attributed to the Hindus that whosoever partaketh of meat shall
                     never catch a glimpse of Paradise, this runneth counter to their other assertion that
                     all the Prophets are true. For if their truth be established, then it is absurd to
                     claim that their followers will not ascend unto Paradise. One fain would ask what
                     they intend by Paradise and what they have grasped thereof. In this day whosoever
                     attaineth the good pleasure of the one true God, magnified be His glory, shall be
                     remembered and accounted among the inmates of the all-highest Heaven and the most
                     exalted Paradise, and shall partake of its benefits in all the worlds of God. By Him
                     Who is the Desire of all men! The pen is powerless to portray this station or to expound
                     this theme. How great the blessedness of him who hath attained unto the good-pleasure
                     of God, and woe betide the heedless! Once the validity of a divinely appointed Prophet
                     hath been established, to none is given the right to ask why or wherefore. Rather
                     is it incumbent upon all to accept and obey whatsoever He saith. This is that which
                     God hath decreed in all His Books, Scriptures and Tablets.

                     <a id="248394742" class="brl-location"></a>A further question that he hath asked: “The Hindus assert that God fashioned the Intellect
                     in the form of a man named Brahma, Who came into this world and was the cause of its
                     progress and development, and that all Hindus are His descendants. The followers of
                     Zoroaster say: ‘God, through the agency of the Primal Intellect, created a man whose
                     name is Mahábád and who is our ancestor.’ They believe the modes of creation to be
                     six in number. Two were mentioned above; the others are creation from water, earth,
                     fire, and from bears and monkeys. The Hindus and Zoroastrians both say that they are
                     begotten of the Intellect, and thus do not admit others into their folds. Are these
                     assertions true or not? That wise Master is requested to indicate that which he deemeth
                     appropriate.”

                     <a id="670571743" class="brl-location"></a>The entire creation hath been called into being through the Will of God, magnified
                     be His glory, and peerless Adam hath been fashioned through the agency of His all-compelling
                     Word, a Word which is the source, the wellspring, the repository, and the dawning-place
                     of the intellect. From it all creation hath proceeded, and it is the channel of God’s
                     primal grace. None can grasp the reality of the origin of creation save God, exalted
                     be His glory, Whose knowledge embraceth all things both before and after they come
                     into being. Creation hath neither beginning nor end, and none hath ever unravelled
                     its mystery. Its knowledge hath ever been, and shall remain, hidden and preserved
                     with those Who are the Repositories of divine knowledge.

                     essential preexistence hath ever been, and shall remain, confined to God, magnified
                     be His glory. This statement is being made lest one be inclined to conclude from the
                     earlier assertion, namely that creation hath no beginning and no end, that it is preexistent.
                     True and essential preexistence is exclusively reserved to God, while the preexistence
                     of the world is secondary and relative. All that hath been inferred about firstness,
                     lastness and such hath in truth been derived from the sayings of the Prophets, Apostles,
                     and Chosen Ones of God.

                     aught else is mere superstition and idle fancy. At the time of the Revelation all
                     men are equal in rank. By reason, however, of their acceptance or rejection, rise
                     or fall, motion or stillness, recognition or denial, they come to differ thereafter.
                     For instance, the one true God, magnified be His glory, speaking through the intermediary
                     of His Manifestation, doth ask: “Am I not your Lord?” Every soul that answereth “Yea,
                     verily!” is accounted among the most distinguished of all men in the sight of God.
                     Our meaning is that ere the Word of God is delivered, all men are deemed equal in
                     rank and their station is one and the same. It is only thereafter that differences
                     appear, as thou hast no doubt observed.

                     The truth that shineth bright and resplendent as the sun is this, that all have been
                     created through the operation of the Divine Will and have proceeded from the same
                     source, that all are from Him and that unto Him they shall all return. This is the

                     <a id="347624385" class="brl-location"></a>As is clear and evident to thee, the answer to all of the questions mentioned above
                     was embodied in but one of the passages revealed by the Pen of the Most High. Blessed
                     are they who, freed from worldly matters and sanctified from idle fancies and vain
                     imaginings, traverse the meads of divine knowledge and discern in all things the tokens
                     of His glory.

                     <a id="002512683" class="brl-location"></a>Numerous passages have been revealed in the name of his honour the Ṣáḥib. Were he
                     to appreciate their value and avail himself of their fruits, he would experience such
                     joy that all the sorrows of the world would be powerless to afflict him. God grant
                     that he may be enabled to sincerely voice, and to act in accordance with, the following
                     words: “Say: It is God; then leave them to entertain themselves with their cavilings.”<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#991089858">21</a></sup> May he endeavour to guide those deprived souls who remain secluded in darkness and
                     obscurity towards the light of the Sun. May he seize, through the potency of the Most
                     Great Name, the banner that speaketh of naught save His Revelation and march at the
                     forefront of the people of the former religions, that perchance the darkness of the
                     world may be dispelled and the effulgent rays of the Sun of Truth may shine upon all
                     mankind. This, in truth, is the most perfect bounty and the highest calling. Should
                     man fail to attain unto this sublime station, where then can he find comfort and joy?
                     What will sustain and animate him? With whom will he commune at the hour of repose,
                     and whose name will he invoke when he riseth from slumber? Again: “Verily, we are
                     God’s, and to Him shall we return.”

                     <a id="106290467" class="brl-location"></a>His last question. “Most of the Tablets that we have seen are in Arabic. However,
                     since the Beloved in this age is of Persian descent, the Arabic tongue should be abandoned
                     and discarded. For to this day the Arabs themselves have not understood the meaning
                     of the Qur’án, whereas the Persian language is highly prized, lauded and admired among
                     the dwellers of the inhabited quarter of the globe. And just as the Persian of the
                     present day is superior to Arabic, so too is Old Persian, which is greatly favoured
                     by the people of India and others. It would therefore be preferable if the words of
                     God, magnified be His mention, were hereafter mainly delivered in pure Persian, since
                     it attracteth the hearts to a greater degree. It is moreover requested that the reply
                     to these questions be graciously written in pure Persian.”

                     <a id="808904024" class="brl-location"></a>The Persian tongue is in truth exceedingly sweet and pleasing, and ever since this
                     request was submitted in His most blessed and exalted court, numerous Tablets have
                     been revealed in that language. As to the statement concerning the Qur’án implying
                     that its outward meaning hath not been understood, in reality it hath been interpreted
                     in numerous ways and translated into countless languages. That which men have been
                     unable to grasp are its hidden mysteries and inner meanings. And all that they have
                     said or will say is limited in scope and should be seen as commensurate with their
                     rank and station. For none can fathom its true meaning save God, the One, the Incomparable,
                     the All-Knowing.

                     hath appeared. Let every ear be eager to hearken unto that which will be revealed
                     from the kingdom of His will; let every eye be expectant to gaze upon that which will
                     shine forth from the Daystar of knowledge and wisdom. By Him Who is the Desire of
                     the world! This is the day for eyes to see and for ears to hear, for hearts to perceive
                     and for tongues to speak forth. Blessed are they that have attained thereunto; blessed
                     are they that have sought after and recognized it! This is the day whereon every man
                     may accede unto everlasting honour, for whatsoever hath streamed forth from the Pen
                     of Glory in regard to any soul is adorned with the ornament of immortality. Again,

                     <a id="050265731" class="brl-location"></a>The distinguished Ṣáḥib hath written: “Since the Beloved in this age is of Persian
                     descent, the Arabic tongue should be abandoned and discarded.” In this connection
                     these sublime words issued from the Pen of the Most High, magnified and exalted be
                     His glory: “Both Arabic and Persian are laudable. That which is desired of a language
                     is that it convey the intent of the speaker, and either language can serve this purpose.
                     And since in this day the Orb of knowledge hath risen in the firmament of Persia,
                     this tongue deserveth every praise.”

                     <a id="347349101" class="brl-location"></a>The light of truth is indeed shining resplendent above the horizon of divine utterance,
                     and hence no further elaboration is required from this evanescent soul or from others
                     like unto him. Although there can be no question or doubt as to the sweetness of the
                     Persian tongue, yet it hath not the scope of the Arabic. There are many things which
                     have not been expressed in Persian, that is to say, words referring to such things
                     have not been devised, whilst in Arabic there are several words describing the same
                     thing. Indeed there existeth no language in the world as vast and comprehensive as
                     Arabic. This statement is prompted by truth and fairness; otherwise it is clear that
                     in this day the world is being illumined by the splendours of that Sun which hath
                     dawned above the horizon of Persia, and that the merits of this sweet language can
                     scarcely be overestimated.

                     is but one of the expressions of the former. Verily, justice is a lamp that guideth
                     man aright amidst the darkness of the world and shieldeth him from every danger. It
                     is indeed a shining lamp. God grant that the rulers of the earth may be illumined
                     by its light. This servant further imploreth God to graciously aid all men to do His

                     <a id="324703384" class="brl-location"></a>The beginning of all utterance is the worship of God, and this followeth upon His
                     recognition. Sanctified must be the eye if it is to truly recognize Him, and sanctified
                     must be the tongue if it is to befittingly utter His praise. In this day the faces
                     of the people of insight and understanding are turned in His direction; nay every

                     as comfort itself. Every affliction suffered for His sake is a potent remedy, every
                     bitterness is naught but sweetness and every abasement an exaltation. Were men to
                     apprehend and acknowledge this truth, they would readily lay down their lives for
                     such affliction. For it is the key to inestimable treasures, and no matter how outwardly
                     abhorrent, it hath ever been and will continue to be inwardly prized. We accept and
                     affirm what thou hast said, for the people of the world are indeed bereft of the light
                     of the Orb of justice and regard it as their enemy.

                     <a id="440767791" class="brl-location"></a>If thou desirest to be freed from affliction, recite thou this prayer which hath been
                     revealed by the Pen of the All-Merciful: “O God, my God! I testify to Thy unity and
                     to Thy oneness. I beseech Thee, O Thou Possessor of names and Fashioner of the heavens,
                     by the pervasive influence of Thine exalted Word and the potency of Thy supreme Pen,
                     to aid me with the ensigns of Thy power and might, and to protect me from the mischief
                     of Thine enemies who have violated Thy Covenant and Thy Testament. Thou art, verily,
                     the Almighty, the Most Powerful.” This invocation is an impregnable stronghold and
                     an indomitable army. It conferreth protection and ensureth deliverance.

                     <a id="123653090" class="brl-location"></a>O friend! Whatsoever hath been announced in the Books hath been revealed and made
                     clear. From every direction the signs have been manifested. The Omnipotent One is
                     calling, in this day, and announcing the appearance of the Supreme Heaven. The world
                     hath been illumined with the splendours of His revelation, yet how few are the eyes
                     that can behold it! Beseech the peerless and incomparable Lord to bestow a penetrating
                     insight upon His servants, for insight leadeth to true knowledge and is conducive
                     to salvation. Indeed, the attainments of man’s understanding are dependent upon his
                     keenness of sight. Were the children of men to gaze with the eye of understanding,
                     they would see the world illumined with a new light in this day. Say: The Daystar

                     <a id="741760616" class="brl-location"></a>The fifth question concerneth the Bridge of Ṣiráṭ, Paradise, and Hell. The Prophets
                     of God have come in truth and have spoken the truth. Whatsoever the Messenger of God
                     hath announced hath been and will be made manifest. The world is established upon
                     the foundations of reward and punishment. Knowledge and understanding have ever affirmed
                     and will continue to affirm the reality of Paradise and Hell, for reward and punishment
                     require their existence. Paradise signifieth first and foremost the good-pleasure
                     of God. Whosoever attaineth His good-pleasure is reckoned and recorded among the inhabitants
                     of the most exalted paradise and will attain, after the ascension of his soul, that
                     which pen and ink are powerless to describe. For them that are endued with insight
                     and have fixed their gaze upon the Most Sublime Vision, the Bridge, the Balance, Paradise,
                     Hellfire, and all that hath been mentioned and recorded in the Sacred Scriptures are
                     clear and manifest. At the time of the appearance and manifestation of the rays of
                     the Daystar of Truth, all occupy the same station. God then proclaimeth that which
                     He willeth, and whoso heareth His call and acknowledgeth His truth is accounted among
                     the inhabitants of Paradise. Such a soul hath traversed the Bridge, the Balance, and
                     all that hath been recorded regarding the Day of Resurrection, and hath reached his
                     destination. The Day of God’s Revelation is the Day of the most great Resurrection.
                     We cherish the hope that, quaffing from the choice wine of divine inspiration and
                     the pure waters of heavenly grace, thou mayest attain the station of discovery and
                     witnessing, and behold, both outwardly and inwardly, all that which thou hast mentioned.

                        the day whereon the high priests can command and exercise their authority. In your
                        Book it is stated that the high priests will, on that day, lead men far astray, and
                        will prevent them from drawing nigh unto Him. He indeed is a high priest who hath
                        seen the light and hastened unto the way leading to the Beloved. Such a man is a benevolent
                        priest and a source of illumination to the whole world.
