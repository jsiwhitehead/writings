                        let your manner be sympathetic. Let it be seen that you are filled with universal
                        love. When you meet a Persian or any other stranger, speak to him as to a friend;
                        if he seems to be lonely try to help him, give him of your willing service; if he
                        be sad console him, if poor succor him, if oppressed rescue him, if in misery comfort
                        him. In so doing you will manifest that not in words only, but in deed and in truth,
                        you think of all men as your brothers.

                        (1st) Thought that belongs to the world of thought alone. <br/>

                        <a id="184033132" class="brl-location"></a>Some men and women glory in their exalted thoughts, but if these thoughts never reach
                        the plane of action they remain useless: the power of thought is dependent on its
                        manifestation in deeds. A philosopher’s thought may, however, in the world of progress
                        and evolution, translate itself into the actions of other people, even when they themselves
                        are unable or unwilling to show forth their grand ideals in their own lives. To this
                        class the majority of philosophers belong, their teachings being high above their
                        actions. This is the difference between philosophers who are Spiritual Teachers, and
                        those who are mere philosophers: the Spiritual Teacher is the first to follow His
                        own teaching; He brings down into the world of action His spiritual conceptions and
                        ideals. His Divine thoughts are made manifest to the world. His thought is Himself,
                        from which He is inseparable. When we find a philosopher emphasizing the importance
                        and grandeur of justice, and then encouraging a rapacious monarch in his oppression
                        and tyranny, we quickly realize that he belongs to the first class: for he thinks
                        heavenly thoughts and does not practice the corresponding heavenly virtues.

                        high and noble thoughts in actions.

                        <a id="986042541" class="brl-location"></a>Look also at the animals, how helpless they are in their apparent strength! For the
                        elephant, the largest of all animals, is troubled by the fly, and the lion cannot
                        escape the irritation of the worm. Even man, the highest form of created beings, needs
                        many things for his very life; first of all he needs air, and if he is deprived of
                        it for a few minutes, he dies. He is also dependent on water, food, clothing, warmth,
                        and many other things. On all sides he is surrounded by dangers and difficulties,
                        against which his physical body alone cannot cope. If a man looks at the world around
                        him, he will see how all created things are dependent and are captive to the laws
                        of Nature.

                        The Báb arose in the Eastern land of Persia. Bahá’u’lláh lived and taught in the East.
                        All the great Spiritual Teachers arose in the Eastern world. But although the Sun

                        the world! How is it possible for men to fight from morning until evening, killing
                        each other, shedding the blood of their fellowmen: And for what object? To gain possession
                        of a part of the earth! Even the animals, when they fight, have an immediate and more
                        reasonable cause for their attacks! How terrible it is that men, who are of the higher
                        kingdom, can descend to slaying and bringing misery to their fellow-beings, for the
                        possession of a tract of land!

                        his tomb. It is for their tombs these men are fighting. There is nothing so horrible
                        in this world as the tomb, the abode of the decaying bodies of men.

                        <a id="333662675" class="brl-location"></a>A Greek philosopher living in the days of the youth of Christianity, being full of
                        the Christian element, though not a professing Christian, wrote thus: “It is my belief
                        that religion is the very foundation of true civilization.” For, unless the moral
                        character of a nation is educated, as well as its brain and its talents, civilization
                        has no sure basis.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="584892772" class="brl-location"></a>As religion inculcates morality, it is therefore the truest philosophy, and on it
                        is built the only lasting civilization. As an example of this, he points out the Christians
                        of the time whose morality was on a very high level. The belief of this philosopher
                        conforms to the truth, for the civilization of Christianity was the best and most
                        enlightened in the world. The Christian Teaching was illumined by the Divine Sun of
                        Truth, therefore its followers were taught to love all men as  brothers to fear nothing,
                        not even death! To love their neighbors as themselves, and to forget their own selfish
                        interests in striving for the greater good of humanity. The grand aim of the religion
                        of Christ was to draw the hearts of all men nearer to God’s effulgent Truth.

                        <a id="400293580" class="brl-location"></a>If the followers of the Lord Christ had continued to follow out these principles with
                        steadfast faithfulness, there would have been no need for a renewal of the Christian
                        Message, no necessity for a reawakening of His people, for a great and glorious civilization
                        would now be ruling the world and the Kingdom of Heaven would have come on earth.

                        of men. For, as the body of man depends for life upon the rays of the sun, so cannot
                        the celestial virtues grow in the soul without the radiance of the Sun of Truth.

                        <a id="820730138" class="brl-location"></a>God leaves not His children comfortless, but, when the darkness of winter overshadows
                        them, then again He sends His Messengers, the Prophets, with a renewal of the blessed
                        spring. The Sun of Truth appears again on the horizon of the world shining into the
                        eyes of those who sleep, awaking them to behold the glory of a new dawn. Then again
                        will the tree of humanity blossom and bring forth the fruit of righteousness for the
                        healing of the nations. Because man has stopped his ears to the Voice of Truth and
                        shut his eyes to the Sacred Light, neglecting the Law of God, for this  reason has
                        the darkness of war and tumult, unrest and misery, desolated the earth. I pray that
                        you will all strive to bring each child of God into the radiance of the Sun of Truth,
                        that the darkness may be dissipated by the penetrating rays of its glory, and the
                        winter’s hardness and cold may be melted away by the merciful warmth of its shining.

                        forth good fruit. It is a long time since the Sun of Truth mirrored forth by the Lord
                        Christ has shed its radiance upon the West, for the Face of God has been veiled by
                        the sin and forgetfulness of man. But now again, praise be to God, the Holy Spirit
                        speaks anew to the world! The constellation of love and wisdom and power is once more

                        of God. Bahá’u’lláh has rent the veil of prejudice and superstition which was stifling
                        the souls of men. Let us pray to God that the breath of the Holy Spirit may again
                        give hope and refreshment to the people, awakening in them a desire to do the Will
                        of God. May heart and soul be vivified in every man: so will they all rejoice in a

                        Everyone agrees in saying that love and kindness are best.

                        <a id="921753670" class="brl-location"></a>Love manifests its reality in deeds, not only in words—these alone are without effect.
                        In order that love may manifest its power there must be an object, an instrument,
                        a motive.

                        <a id="081283473" class="brl-location"></a>There are many ways of expressing the love principle; there is love for the family,
                        for the country, for the race, there is political enthusiasm, there is also the love
                        of community of interest in service. These are all ways and means of showing the power
                        of love. Without any such means, love would be unseen, unheard, unfelt—altogether
                        unexpressed, unmanifested! Water shows its power in various ways, in quenching thirst,
                        causing seed to grow, etc. Coal expresses one of its  principles in gaslight, while
                        one of the powers of electricity is shown in the electric light. If there were neither
                        gas nor electricity, the nights of the world would be darkness! So, it is necessary
                        to have an instrument, a motive for love’s manifestation, an object, a mode of expression.

                        Heaven will support you while you work in this ingathering of the scattered peoples
                        of the world beneath the shadow of the almighty tent of unity.

                        his intellect he has discovered means by which he not only traverses great continents
                        in express trains and crosses vast oceans in ships, but, like the fish he travels
                        under water in submarines, and, imitating the birds, he flies through the air in airships.

                        hatred and discord and devastation, for the destruction of his fellow-creatures, whom
                        Christ has commanded that he should love as himself!

                        He was born of Mary, His Mother. But when He  declared that He had come from Heaven,
                        it is clear that He did not mean the blue firmament but that He spoke of the Heaven
                        of the Kingdom of God, and that from this Heaven He descended upon the clouds. As
                        clouds are obstacles to the shining of the sun, so the clouds of the world of humanity
                        hid from the eyes of men the radiance of the Divinity of Christ.

                        of His human body were limited but the strength of His spirit was vast, infinite,
                        immeasurable.

                        they would have known that the body of His humanity was a cloud that hid His Divinity.
                        The world only saw His human form, and therefore wondered how He could have “come
                        down from Heaven.”

                        to you the principal reason of the unrest among nations. The chief cause is the misrepresentation
                        of religion by the religious leaders and teachers. They teach their followers to believe
                        that their own form of religion is the only one pleasing to God, and that followers
                        of any other persuasion are condemned by the All-Loving Father and deprived of His
                        Mercy and Grace. Hence arise among  the peoples, disapproval, contempt, disputes and
                        hatred. If these religious prejudices could be swept away, the nations would soon
                        enjoy peace and concord.

                        opposite the Temple, and there I saw and heard a Rabbi speaking to his congregation
                        of Jews, and he spoke thus:
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="195348228" class="brl-location"></a>“O Jews, you are in truth the people of God! All other races and religions are of
                        the devil. God has created you the descendants of Abraham, and He has showered His
                        blessings upon you. Unto you God sent Moses, Jacob and Joseph, and many other great
                        prophets. These prophets, one and all, were of your race.

                        did He give you water to quench your thirst. You are indeed the chosen people of God,
                        you are above all the races of the earth! Therefore, all other races are abhorrent
                        to God, and condemned by Him. In truth you will govern and subdue the world, and all
                        men shall become your slaves.

                        earth. Today there are millions of people who still worship idols, and the  great
                        religions of the world are at war among themselves. For 1,300 years, Christians and
                        Muslims have been quarreling, when with very little effort their differences and disputes
                        could be overcome and peace and harmony could exist between them and the world could

                        <a id="763237861" class="brl-location"></a>“Why do you not believe in Christ, and in the Gospel? Why will you not accept Moses
                        and the Prophets, for surely the Bible is the Book of God? In truth, Moses was a sublime
                        Prophet, and Jesus was filled with the Holy Spirit. He came to the world through the
                        Power of God, born of the Holy Spirit and of the blessed Virgin Mary. Mary, His mother,
                        was a saint from Heaven. She passed her days in the Temple at prayer and food was
                        sent to her from above. Her father, Zacharias, came to her and asked her from whence
                        the food came, and Mary made answer, ‘From on high.’ Surely God made Mary to be exalted
                        above all other women.”

                        <a id="163157394" class="brl-location"></a>This is what Muḥammad taught His people concerning Jesus and Moses, and He reproached
                        them for their lack of faith in these great Teachers, and taught them the lessons
                        of truth and tolerance. Muḥammad was sent from God to work among a people as savage
                        and uncivilized as the wild beasts. They were quite devoid of understanding, nor had
                        they any feelings of love, sympathy and pity. Women were so degraded and despised
                        that a man could bury his daughter alive, and he had as many wives to be his slaves
                        as he chose.

                        <a id="955064180" class="brl-location"></a>Among these half animal people Muḥammad was sent with His divine Message. He taught
                        the people that idol worship was wrong, and that they should reverence Christ, Moses
                        and the Prophets. Under His influence they became a more enlightened and civilized
                        people and arose from the degraded state in which He found them. Was not this a good
                        work, and worthy of all praise, respect and love?

                        <a id="811869430" class="brl-location"></a>Christ forbade war! When the disciple Peter, thinking to defend his Lord, cut off
                        the ear of the servant of the High Priest, Christ said to him: “Put up thy sword into
                        the sheath.”<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#045258083">1</a></sup> Yet, in spite of the direct command of the Lord they profess to serve—men still dispute,

                        <a id="556429992" class="brl-location"></a>But do not therefore attribute to the Masters and Prophets the evil deeds of their
                        followers. If the priests, teachers and people, lead lives which are contrary to the
                        religion they profess to follow, is that the fault of Christ or the other Teachers?

                        <a id="806839209" class="brl-location"></a>The people of Islám were taught to realize how Jesus came from God and was born of
                        the Spirit, and that He must be glorified of all men. Moses was a prophet of God,
                        and revealed in His day and for the people to whom He was sent, the Book of God.

                        <a id="307469964" class="brl-location"></a>Muḥammad recognized the sublime grandeur of  Christ and the greatness of Moses and
                        the prophets. If only the whole world would acknowledge the greatness of Muḥammad
                        and all the Heaven-sent Teachers, strife and discord would soon vanish from the face
                        of the earth, and God’s Kingdom would come among men.

                        <a id="133369869" class="brl-location"></a>Christ was the Prophet of the Christians, Moses of the Jews—why should not the followers

                        man eats too much, he ruins his digestion; if he takes poison he becomes  ill or dies.
                        If a person gambles he will lose his money; if he drinks too much he will lose his
                        equilibrium. All these sufferings are caused by the man himself, it is quite clear
                        therefore that certain sorrows are the result of our own deeds.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="415906034" class="brl-location"></a>(b) Other sufferings there are, which come upon the Faithful of God. Consider the
                        great sorrows endured by Christ and by His apostles!
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="169651166" class="brl-location"></a>Those who suffer most, attain to the greatest perfection.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="815262059" class="brl-location"></a>Those who declare a wish to suffer much for Christ’s sake must prove their sincerity;
                        those who proclaim their longing to make great sacrifices can only prove their truth
                        by their deeds. Job proved the fidelity of his love for God by being faithful through
                        his great adversity, as well as during the prosperity of his life. The apostles of
                        Christ who steadfastly bore all their trials and sufferings—did they not prove their
                        faithfulness? Was not their endurance the best proof?
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="906629956" class="brl-location"></a>These griefs are now ended.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="119765690" class="brl-location"></a>Caiaphas lived a comfortable and happy life while Peter’s life was full of sorrow
                        and trial; which of these two is the more enviable? Assuredly we should choose the
                        present state of Peter, for he possesses immortal life whilst Caiaphas has won eternal
                        shame. The trials of Peter tested his fidelity. Tests are benefits from God, for which
                        we should thank Him. Grief and sorrow do not come to us by chance, they are sent to
                        us by the Divine Mercy for our own perfecting.
                     </p>

                        <a id="545033327" class="brl-location"></a>While a man is happy he may forget his God; but when grief comes and sorrows overwhelm
                        him, then  will he remember his Father who is in Heaven, and who is able to deliver
                        him from his humiliations.

                        <a id="019442004" class="brl-location"></a>Men who suffer not, attain no perfection. The plant most pruned by the gardeners is
                        that one which, when the summer comes, will have the most beautiful blossoms and the
                        most abundant fruit.

                        and plentiful harvest. The more a man is chastened, the greater is the harvest of
                        spiritual virtues shown forth by him. A soldier is no good General until he has been
                        in the front of the fiercest battle and has received the deepest wounds.

                        the supreme sacrifice.

                        which everything in nature yearns. This conception was embodied in the words of Christ,
                        when He said, “I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end.” Man is the
                        sum of Creation, and the Perfect Man is the expression of the complete thought of
                        the Creator—the Word of God.

                        <a id="162231767" class="brl-location"></a>Consider the world of created beings, how varied  and diverse they are in species,
                        yet with one sole origin. All the differences that appear are those of outward form
                        and color. This diversity of type is apparent throughout the whole of nature.
                     </p>

                        <a id="415735903" class="brl-location"></a>Behold a beautiful garden full of flowers, shrubs, and trees. Each flower has a different
                        charm, a peculiar beauty, its own delicious perfume and beautiful color. The trees
                        too, how varied are they in size, in growth, in foliage—and what different fruits
                        they bear! Yet all these flowers, shrubs and trees spring from the self-same earth,
                        the same sun shines upon them and the same clouds give them rain.
                     </p>

                        <a id="336990740" class="brl-location"></a>So it is with humanity. It is made up of many races, and its peoples are of different
                        color, white, black, yellow, brown and red—but they all come from the same God, and
                        all are servants to Him. This diversity among the children of men has unhappily not
                        the same effect as it has among the vegetable creation, where the spirit shown is
                        more harmonious. Among men exists the diversity of animosity, and it is this that
                        causes war and hatred among the different nations of the world.
                     </p>

                        <a id="659787894" class="brl-location"></a>Differences which are only those of blood also cause them to destroy and kill one
                        another. Alas! that this should still be so. Let us look rather at the beauty in diversity,
                        the beauty of harmony, and learn a lesson from the vegetable creation. If you beheld
                        a garden in which all the plants were the same as to form, color and perfume, it would
                        not seem beautiful to you at all, but, rather, monotonous and dull. The garden which
                        is pleasing to the eye and which makes the heart glad,  is the garden in which are
                        growing side by side flowers of every hue, form and perfume, and the joyous contrast
                        of color is what makes for charm and beauty. So is it with trees. An orchard full
                        of fruit trees is a delight; so is a plantation planted with many species of shrubs.
                        It is just the diversity and variety that constitutes its charm; each flower, each
                        tree, each fruit, beside being beautiful in itself, brings out by contrast the qualities
                        of the others, and shows to advantage the special loveliness of each and all.
                     </p>

                        <a id="268841058" class="brl-location"></a>Thus should it be among the children of men! The diversity in the human family should
                        be the cause of love and harmony, as it is in music where many different notes blend
                        together in the making of a perfect chord. If you meet those of different race and
                        color from yourself, do not mistrust them and withdraw yourself into your shell of
                        conventionality, but rather be glad and show them kindness. Think of them as different
                        colored roses growing in the beautiful garden of humanity, and rejoice to be among
                        them.

                        your face from them. All are seeking truth, and there are many roads leading thereto.
                        Truth has many aspects, but it remains always and forever one.

                        universal unity. This is the work of the Divine Bounty, and we must all strive with
                        heart and soul until we have the reality of unity in our midst, and as we work, so

                        <a id="222730308" class="brl-location"></a>When Christ came they denounced and slew Him, saying: “This is not the One for whom
                        we wait. Behold when the Messiah shall come, signs and wonders shall testify that
                        He is in truth the Christ. We know the signs and conditions, and they have not appeared.
                        The Messiah will arise out of an unknown city. He  shall sit upon the throne of David,
                        and behold, He shall come with a sword of steel, and with a scepter of iron shall
                        He rule! He shall fulfill the law of the Prophets, He shall conquer the East and the
                        West, and shall glorify His chosen people the Jews. He shall bring with Him a reign
                        of peace, during which even the animals shall cease to be at enmity with man. For
                        behold the wolf and the lamb shall drink from the same spring, and the lion and the
                        doe shall lie down in the same pasture, the serpent and the mouse shall share the

                        <a id="995986770" class="brl-location"></a>He came from Nazareth, no unknown place. He carried no sword in His hand, nor even
                        a stick. He did not sit upon the Throne of David, He was a poor man. He reformed the
                        Law of Moses, and broke the Sabbath Day. He did not conquer the East and the West,
                        but was Himself subject to the Roman Law. He did not exalt the Jews, but taught equality
                        and brotherhood, and rebuked the Scribes and Pharisees. He brought in no reign of
                        peace, for during His lifetime injustice and cruelty reached such a height that even
                        He Himself fell a victim to it, and died a shameful death upon the cross.

                        <a id="745087259" class="brl-location"></a>Thus the Jews thought and spoke, for they did not understand the Scriptures nor the
                        glorious truths that were contained in them. The letter they knew by heart, but of
                        the life-giving spirit they understood not a word.

                        <a id="833862888" class="brl-location"></a>Hearken, and I will show you the meaning thereof. Although He came from Nazareth,
                        which was a known place, He also came from Heaven. His body was born of Mary, but
                        His Spirit came from Heaven. The sword He carried was the sword of His tongue, with
                        which He divided the good from the evil, the true from the false, the faithful from
                        the unfaithful, and the light from the darkness. His Word was indeed a sharp sword!
                        The Throne upon which He sat is the Eternal Throne from which Christ reigns forever,
                        a heavenly throne, not an earthly one, for the things of earth pass away but heavenly
                        things pass not away. He reinterpreted and completed the Law of Moses and fulfilled
                        the Law of the Prophets. His word conquered the East and the West. His Kingdom is
                        everlasting. He exalted those Jews who recognized Him. They were men and women of
                        humble birth, but contact with Him made them great and gave them everlasting dignity.
                        The animals who were to live with one another signified the different sects and races,
                        who, once having been at war, were now to dwell in love and charity, drinking together
                        the water of life from Christ the Eternal Spring.

                        not hear, and the Divine Reality of Christ passed through their midst unheard, unloved
                        and unrecognized.

                        us to understand the Holy Books. Let us pray for eyes to see and ears to hear, and

                        <span class="brl-uppercase">Today</span> is a day of rejoicing in Paris! They are celebrating the Festival of “All Saints.”
                        Why do you think that these people were called “Saints?” The word has a very real
                        meaning. A saint is one who leads a life of purity, one who has freed himself from
                        all human weaknesses and imperfections.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="165303977" class="brl-location"></a>In man there are two natures; his spiritual or higher nature and his material or lower
                        nature. In one he approaches God, in the other he lives for the world alone. Signs
                        of both these natures are to be found in men. In his material aspect he expresses
                        untruth, cruelty and injustice; all these are the outcome of his lower nature. The
                        attributes of his Divine nature are shown forth in love, mercy, kindness, truth and
                        justice, one and all being expressions of his higher nature. Every good habit, every
                        noble quality belongs to man’s spiritual nature, whereas all his imperfections and
                        sinful actions are born of his material nature. If a man’s Divine nature dominates
                        his human nature, we have a saint.
                     </p>

                        <a id="793689034" class="brl-location"></a>Man has the power both to do good and to do evil; if his power for good predominates
                        and his inclinations to do wrong are conquered, then man in truth may be called a
                        saint. But if, on the contrary, he rejects the things of God and allows his evil passions
                        to conquer him, then he is no better than a mere animal.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="787356602" class="brl-location"></a>Saints are men who have freed themselves from the  world of matter and who have overcome
                        sin. They live in the world but are not of it, their thoughts being continually in
                        the world of the spirit. Their lives are spent in holiness, and their deeds show forth
                        love, justice and godliness. They are illumined from on high; they are as bright and
                        shining lamps in the dark places of the earth. These are the saints of God. The apostles,
                        who were the disciples of Jesus Christ, were just as other men are; they, like their
                        fellows, were attracted by the things of the world, and each thought only of his own
                        advantage. They knew little of justice, nor were the Divine perfections found in their
                        midst. But when they followed Christ and believed in Him, their ignorance gave place
                        to understanding, cruelty was changed to justice, falsehood to truth, darkness into
                        light. They had been worldly, they became spiritual and divine. They had been children
                        of darkness, they became sons of God, they became saints! Strive therefore to follow
                        in their steps, leaving all worldly things behind, and striving to attain to the Spiritual
                        Kingdom.

                        the Qur’án, and the other Holy Writings have been given by God  as guides into the

                        been sick, he feels once more in his heart the joyous hope of health renewed. All
                        these gifts of nature concern the physical side of man, for it is only his body that
                        can receive material benefits.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="094394882" class="brl-location"></a>If a man is successful in his business, art, or profession he is thereby enabled to
                        increase his physical wellbeing and to give his body the amount of ease and comfort
                        in which it delights. All around us today we see how man surrounds himself with every
                        modern convenience and luxury, and denies nothing to the physical and material side
                        of his nature. But, take heed, lest in thinking too earnestly of the things of the
                        body you forget the things of the soul: for material advantages  do not elevate the
                        spirit of a man. Perfection in worldly things is a joy to the body of a man but in
                        no wise does it glorify his soul.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="249942261" class="brl-location"></a>It may be that a man who has every material benefit, and who lives surrounded by all
                        the greatest comfort modern civilization can give him, is denied the all important
                        gift of the Holy Spirit.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="135963994" class="brl-location"></a>It is indeed a good and praiseworthy thing to progress materially, but in so doing,
                        let us not neglect the more important spiritual progress, and close our eyes to the
                        Divine light shining in our midst.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="790212040" class="brl-location"></a>Only by improving spiritually as well as materially can we make any real progress,
                        and become perfect beings. It was in order to bring this spiritual life and light
                        into the world that all the great Teachers have appeared. They came so that the Sun
                        of Truth might be manifested, and shine in the hearts of men, and that through its
                        wondrous power men might attain unto Everlasting Light.
                     </p>

                        <a id="631115876" class="brl-location"></a>When the Lord Christ came He spread the light of the Holy Spirit on all around Him,
                        and His disciples and all who received His illumination became enlightened, spiritual
                        beings.
                     </p>

                        <a id="166461631" class="brl-location"></a>It was to manifest this light that Bahá’u’lláh was born, and came into the world.
                        He taught Eternal Truth to men, and shed the rays of Divine Light in all lands.
                     </p>

                        <a id="176818825" class="brl-location"></a>Alas! behold how man disregards this Light. He still goes on his way of darkness,
                        and disunity, and quarrels and fierce war are still rife.
                     </p>

                        <a id="507027469" class="brl-location"></a>He uses material progress to gratify his lust for war,  and he makes destructive implements
                        and appliances to destroy his brother man.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="822095300" class="brl-location"></a>But let us rather exert ourselves for the attainment of spiritual advantages, for
                        this is the only way of true progress, that which cometh from God and is alone Godly.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="138729201" class="brl-location"></a>I pray for you one and all that you may receive the Bounties of the Holy Spirit; so
                        will you become in truth enlightened, and progress ever onward and upward to the Kingdom
                        of God. Then shall your hearts be prepared to receive the glad tidings, your eyes
                        shall be opened and you will see the Glory of God; your ears shall be unstopped and
                        you will hear the call of the Kingdom, and with tongue made eloquent shall you call
                        men to the realization of the Divine Power and Love of God!

                        of your love still keeps me here. God willing, I hope to stay among you yet a little
                        while; bodily cold and heat cannot affect the spirit, for it is warmed by the fire
                        of the Love of God. When we understand this, we begin to understand something of our
                        life in the world to come. 
                     </p>

                        <a id="875670682" class="brl-location"></a>We see that cold, heat, suffering, etc., only concern the <span class="brl-italic">body</span>, they do not touch the spirit.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="588163677" class="brl-location"></a>How often do we see a man, poor, sick, miserably clad, and with no means of support,
                        yet spiritually strong. Whatever his body has to suffer, his spirit is free and well!
                        Again, how often do we see a rich man, physically strong and healthy, but with a soul
                        sick unto death.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="546353724" class="brl-location"></a>It is quite apparent to the seeing mind that a man’s spirit is something very different
                        from his physical body.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="851921831" class="brl-location"></a>The spirit is changeless, indestructible. The progress and development of the soul,
                        the joy and sorrow of the soul, are independent of the physical body.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="232529624" class="brl-location"></a>If we are caused joy or pain by a friend, if a love prove true or false, it is the
                        soul that is affected. If our dear ones are far from us—it is the soul that grieves,
                        and the grief or trouble of the soul may react on the body.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="844602363" class="brl-location"></a>Thus, when the spirit is fed with holy virtues, then is the body joyous; if the soul
                        falls into sin, the body is in torment!
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="232471605" class="brl-location"></a>When we find truth, constancy, fidelity, and love, we are happy; but if we meet with
                        lying, faithlessness, and deceit, we are miserable.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="843987329" class="brl-location"></a>These are all things pertaining to the soul, and are not <span class="brl-italic">bodily</span> ills. Thus, it is apparent that the soul, even as the body, has its own individuality.
                        But if the body  undergoes a change, the spirit need not be touched. When you break
                        a glass on which the sun shines, the glass is broken, but the sun still shines! If
                        a cage containing a bird is destroyed, the bird is unharmed! If a lamp is broken,
                        the flame can still burn bright!
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="798976726" class="brl-location"></a>The same thing applies to the spirit of man. Though death destroy his body, it has
                        no power over his spirit—this is eternal, everlasting, both birthless and deathless.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="713674720" class="brl-location"></a>As to the soul of man after death, it remains in the degree of purity to which it
                        has evolved during life in the physical body, and after it is freed from the body
                        it remains plunged in the ocean of God’s Mercy.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="808224221" class="brl-location"></a>From the moment the soul leaves the body and arrives in the Heavenly World, its evolution
                        is spiritual, and that evolution is: <span class="brl-italic">The approaching unto God.</span>

                        <a id="901160003" class="brl-location"></a>In the physical creation, evolution is from one degree of perfection to another. The
                        mineral passes with its mineral perfections to the vegetable; the vegetable, with
                        its perfections, passes to the animal world, and so on to that of humanity. This world
                        is full of seeming contradictions; in each of these kingdoms (mineral, vegetable and
                        animal) life exists in its degree; though when compared to the life in a man, the
                        earth appears to be dead, yet she, too, lives and has a life of her own. In this world
                        things live and die, and live again in other forms of life, but in the world of the
                        spirit it is quite otherwise.

                        <a id="359758525" class="brl-location"></a>The soul does not evolve from degree to degree as a law—it only evolves nearer to
                        God, by the Mercy and Bounty of God.

                        But rarely does a breath from the spirit world breathe upon them. They seem unconscious
                        of the Divine Voice, careless concerning the things of God. But this meeting in Paris
                        is a truly spiritual one. The Divine Breath is poured forth in your midst, the light

                        <a id="552601537" class="brl-location"></a>You are very welcome! From Eastern lands I have come to the West to sojourn awhile
                        among you. In the East it is often said that the people of the West are without spirituality,
                        but I have not found it thus. Thank God, I see and feel that there is much spiritual
                        aspiration among the Western peoples, and that in some cases their spiritual perception
                        is even keener than among their Eastern brothers. If the teaching given in the East
                        had been conscientiously spread in the West the world today would be a more enlightened
                        place. 
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="478714053" class="brl-location"></a>Although in the past all the great Spiritual Teachers have arisen in the East, there
                        are still many men there who are quite devoid of spirituality. With regard to the
                        things of the spirit they are as lifeless as a stone; nor do they wish to be otherwise,
                        for they consider that man is only a higher form of animal and that the things of
                        God concern him not.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="316565675" class="brl-location"></a>But man’s ambition should soar above this—he should ever look higher than himself,
                        ever upward and onward, until through the Mercy of God he may come to the Kingdom
                        of Heaven. Again, there are men whose eyes are only open to physical progress and
                        to the evolution in the world of matter. These men prefer to study the resemblance
                        between their own physical body and that of the ape, rather than to contemplate the
                        glorious affiliation between their spirit and that of God. This is indeed strange,
                        for it is only physically that man resembles the lower creation, with regard to his
                        intellect he is totally unlike it.
                     </p>

                        <a id="009392682" class="brl-location"></a>Man is always progressing. His circle of knowledge is ever widening, and his mental
                        activity flows through many and varied channels. Look what man has accomplished in
                        the field of science, consider his many discoveries and countless inventions and his
                        profound understanding of natural law.

                        <a id="272046480" class="brl-location"></a>In the world of art it is just the same, and this wonderful development of man’s faculties
                        becomes more and more rapid as time goes on. If the discoveries, inventions and material
                        accomplishments of the last fifteen hundred years could be put together, you would
                        see that there has been greater advancement during the  last hundred years than in
                        the previous fourteen centuries. For the rapidity with which man is progressing increases
                        century by century.

                        <a id="563349057" class="brl-location"></a>The power of the intellect is one of God’s greatest gifts to men, it is the power
                        that makes him a higher creature than the animal. For whereas, century by century
                        and age by age man’s intelligence grows and becomes keener, that of the animal remains
                        the same. They are no more intelligent today then they were a thousand years ago!
                        Is there a greater proof than this needed to show man’s dissimilarity to the animal
                        creation? It is surely as clear as day.

                        <a id="535193753" class="brl-location"></a>As for the spiritual perfections they are man’s birthright and belong to him alone
                        of all creation. Man is, in reality, a spiritual being, and only when he lives in
                        the spirit is he truly happy. This spiritual longing and perception belongs to all
                        men alike, and it is my firm conviction that the Western people possess great spiritual
                        aspiration.

                        of God meet together in the fullness of joy, love and unity. They teach the Cause
                        of God, educate the ignorant, and draw heart to heart in brotherly kindness. It is
                        they who help the poor and needy and give to them their daily bread. They love and
                        care for the sick and are messengers of hope and consolation to the desolate and oppressed.

                        <a id="775502697" class="brl-location"></a>I will speak to you today of Bahá’u’lláh. In the third year after the Báb had declared
                        His Mission, Bahá’u’lláh, being accused by fanatical Mullás of believing in the new
                        doctrine, was arrested and thrown into prison. The next day, however, several ministers
                        of the Government and other influential men caused Him to be set free. Later on He
                        was again arrested, and the priests condemned Him to death! The Governor hesitated
                        to have this sentence carried out for fear of a revolution. The priests met together
                        in the Mosque, before which was the place of execution. All the people of the town
                        gathered in crowds outside the Mosque. The carpenters brought their saws and hammers,
                        the butchers came with their knives, the bricklayers and builders shouldered their
                        spades, all these men, incited by the frenzied Mullás, were eager to share in the
                        honor of killing Him. Inside the Mosque were assembled the doctors of religion. Bahá’u’lláh
                        stood before them, and answered all their questions with great wisdom. The chief sage
                        in particular, was completely silenced by Bahá’u’lláh, who refuted all his arguments.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="073317044" class="brl-location"></a>A discussion arose between two of these priests as to the meaning of some words in
                        the writings of the Báb; accusing Him of inaccuracy, they challenged Bahá’u’lláh to
                        defend Him if He were able. These priests were  entirely humiliated, for Bahá’u’lláh
                        proved before the whole assembly that the Báb was absolutely right, and that the accusation
                        was made in ignorance.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="400502853" class="brl-location"></a>The defeated ones now put Him to the torture of the bastinado, and more infuriated
                        than before brought Him out before the walls of the Mosque unto the place of execution,
                        where the misguided people were awaiting His coming.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="438385463" class="brl-location"></a>Still the Governor feared to comply with the demand of the priests for His execution.
                        Realizing the danger in which the dignified prisoner was placed, some men were sent
                        to rescue Him. In this they succeeded by breaking through the wall of the Mosque and
                        leading Bahá’u’lláh through the opening into a place of safety, but not of freedom;
                        for the Governor shifted the responsibility from off his own shoulders by sending
                        Him to Ṭihrán. Here He was imprisoned in an underground dungeon, where the light of
                        day was never seen. A heavy chain was placed about His neck by which He was chained
                        to five other Bábís; these fetters were locked together by strong, very heavy bolts,
                        and screws. His clothes were torn to pieces, also His fez. In this terrible condition
                        He was kept for four months.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="696014779" class="brl-location"></a>During this time none of His friends were able to get access to Him.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="997189328" class="brl-location"></a>A prison official made an attempt to poison Him but, beyond causing Him great suffering,
                        this poison had no effect.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="210910927" class="brl-location"></a>After a time the Government liberated Him and exiled Him and His family to Bag͟hdád,
                        where He remained for eleven years. During this time He  underwent severe persecutions,
                        being surrounded by the watchful hatred of His enemies.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="288201319" class="brl-location"></a>He bore all evils and torments with the greatest courage and fortitude. Often when
                        He arose in the morning, He knew not whether He would live until the sun should set.
                        Meanwhile, each day, the priests came and questioned Him on religion and metaphysics.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="564023430" class="brl-location"></a>At length the Turkish Governor exiled Him to Constantinople, whence He was sent to
                        Adrianople; here He stayed for five years. Eventually, He was sent to the far off
                        prison fortress of St. Jean d’Acre. Here He was imprisoned in the military portion
                        of the fortress and kept under the strictest surveillance. Words would fail me to
                        tell you of the many trials He had to suffer, and all the misery He endured in that
                        prison. Notwithstanding, it was from this prison that Bahá’u’lláh wrote to all the
                        Monarchs of Europe, and these letters with one exception were sent through the post.
                     </p>

                        <a id="055689347" class="brl-location"></a>The Epistle of Náṣiri’d-Dín S͟háh was confided to a Persian Bahá’í, Mírzá Badí‘ K͟hurásání,
                        who undertook to deliver it into the S͟háh’s own hands. This brave man waited in the
                        neighborhood of Ṭihrán for the passing of the S͟háh, who had the intention to journey
                        by that way to his Summer Palace. The courageous messenger followed the S͟háh to his
                        Palace, and waited on the road near the entrance for several days. Always in the same
                        place was he seen waiting on the road, until the people began to wonder why he should
                        be there. At last the S͟háh heard of him, and commanded his servants that the man
                        should be brought before him.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="124890995" class="brl-location"></a>“Oh! servants of the S͟háh, I bring a letter, which I  must deliver into his own hands,”
                        Badí‘ said, and then Badí‘ said to the S͟háh, “I bring you a letter from Bahá’u’lláh!”
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="857384169" class="brl-location"></a>He was immediately seized and questioned by those who wished to elicit information
                        which would help them in the further persecutions of Bahá’u’lláh. Badí‘ would not
                        answer a word; then they tortured him, still he held his peace! After three days they
                        killed him, having failed to force him to speak! These cruel men photographed him
                        whilst he was under torture.<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#727732200">1</a></sup>

                        <a id="713833612" class="brl-location"></a>The S͟háh gave the letter from Bahá’u’lláh to the priests that they might explain
                        it to him. After some days these priests told the S͟háh that the letter was from a
                        political enemy. The S͟háh grew angry and said, “This is no explanation. I pay you
                        to read and answer my letters, therefore obey!”
                     </p>

                        <a id="910969095" class="brl-location"></a>The spirit and meaning of the Tablet to Náṣiri’d-Dín S͟háh was, in short, this: “Now
                        that the time has come, when the Cause of the Glory of God has appeared, I ask that
                        I may be allowed to come to Ṭihrán and answer any questions the priests may put to
                        Me.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="672573472" class="brl-location"></a>“I exhort you to detach yourself from the worldly magnificence of your Empire. Remember
                        all those great kings who have lived before you—their glories have passed away!”
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="746078547" class="brl-location"></a>The letter was written in a most beautiful manner, and continued warning the King
                        and telling him of the future triumph of the Kingdom of Bahá’u’lláh, both in the Eastern
                        and in the Western World. 
                     </p>

                        <a id="414374880" class="brl-location"></a>The S͟háh paid no attention to the warning of this letter and continued to live in
                        the same fashion until the end.
                     </p>

                        men say they love what is good, and hate everything that is evil! Sincerity is to
                        be admired, whilst lying is despicable. Faith is a virtue, and treachery is a disgrace
                        to humanity. It is a blessed thing to gladden the hearts of men, and wrong to be the
                        cause of pain. To be kind and merciful is right, while to hate is sinful. Justice
                        is a noble quality and injustice an iniquity. That it is one’s duty to be pitiful
                        and harm no one, and to avoid jealousy and malice at all costs. Wisdom is the glory
                        of man, not ignorance; light, not darkness! It is a good thing to turn one’s face
                        toward God, and  foolishness to ignore Him. That it is our duty to guide man upward,
                        and not to mislead him and be the cause of his downfall. There are many more examples
                        like unto these.
                     </p>

                        <a id="055120065" class="brl-location"></a>But all these sayings are but words and we see very few of them carried into the world
                        of action. On the contrary, we perceive that men are carried away by passion and selfishness,
                        each man thinking only of what will benefit himself even if it means the ruin of his
                        brother. They are all anxious to make their fortune and care little or nothing for
                        the welfare of others. They are concerned about their <span class="brl-italic">own</span> peace and comfort, while the condition of their fellows troubles them not at all.

                        <a id="700075595" class="brl-location"></a>But Bahá’ís must not be thus; they must rise above this condition. Actions must be
                        more to them than words. By their actions they must be merciful and not merely by
                        their words. They must on all occasions confirm by their actions what they proclaim
                        in words. Their deeds must prove their fidelity, and their actions must show forth
                        Divine light.

                        <a id="762757133" class="brl-location"></a>If we are true Bahá’ís speech is not needed. Our actions will help on the world, will
                        spread civilization, will help the progress of science, and cause the arts to develop.
                        Without action nothing in the material world can be accomplished, neither can words
                        unaided advance a man in the spiritual Kingdom. It is not through  lip-service only
                        that the elect of God have attained to holiness, but by patient lives of active service
                        they have brought light into the world.

                        God, and seek always to do that which is right and noble. Enrich the poor, raise the
                        fallen, comfort the sorrowful, bring healing to the sick, reassure the fearful, rescue
                        the oppressed, bring hope to the hopeless, shelter the destitute!

                        to do all this, then are we true Bahá’ís, but if we neglect it, we are not followers
                        of the Light, and we have no right to the name.

                        <span class="brl-uppercase">In</span> the Gospel according to St. John, Christ has said: “Except a man be born of water
                        and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.”<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#349322992">1</a></sup> The priests have interpreted this into meaning that baptism is necessary for salvation.
                        In another Gospel it is said: “He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire.”<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#261542458">2</a></sup>

                        <a id="472955849" class="brl-location"></a>Thus the water of baptism and the fire are one! It cannot mean that the “water” spoken
                        of is <span class="brl-italic">physical</span> water, for it is the direct opposite of “fire,” and one destroys the other. When
                        in the Gospels, Christ speaks of “water,” He means <span class="brl-italic">that which causes life</span>, for without water no worldly creature can live—mineral, vegetable, animal and man,
                        one and all, depend upon water for their very being. Yes, the latest scientific discoveries
                        prove to us that even mineral has some form of life, and that it also needs water
                        for its existence.

                        <a id="888069350" class="brl-location"></a>Water is the cause of life, and when Christ speaks of water, He is symbolizing that

                        <a id="592560651" class="brl-location"></a>This life-giving water of which He speaks is like unto fire, for it is none other

                        <a id="747238913" class="brl-location"></a>Finally, it was the Love of God that gave to the East Bahá’u’lláh, and is now sending

                        listen to a Divine Message. If you could see with the eye of truth, great waves of
                        spirituality would be visible to you in this place. The power of the Holy Spirit is
                        here for all. Praise be to God that  your hearts are inspired with Divine fervor!
                        Your souls are as waves on the sea of the spirit; although each individual is a distinct

                        but the entire sea. We should rise from the individual to the whole. The spirit is
                        as one great ocean and the waves thereof are the souls of men.

                        it is evident that this celestial city is not built of material stones and mortar,

                        But now, at last, the Holy City of the New Jerusalem has come again to the world,
                        it has appeared anew under an Eastern sky; from the horizon of Persia has its effulgence
                        arisen to be a light to lighten the whole world. We see in these days the fulfillment
                        of the Divine Prophecy. Jerusalem had disappeared. The heavenly city was destroyed,
                        now it is rebuilt; it was razed to the ground, but now its walls and pinnacles have
                        been restored, and are towering aloft in their renewed and glorious beauty.

                        <a id="291963429" class="brl-location"></a>Spirit cannot be perceived by the material senses of the physical body, excepting
                        as it is expressed in outward signs and works. The human body is visible, the soul
                        is invisible. It is the soul nevertheless that directs a man’s faculties, that governs
                        his humanity.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="314676748" class="brl-location"></a>The soul has two main faculties. (a) As outer circumstances are communicated to the
                        soul by the eyes, ears, and brain of a man, so does the soul communicate its desires
                        and purposes through the brain to the hands and tongue of the physical body, thereby
                        expressing itself. The spirit in the soul is the very essence of life. (b) The second
                        faculty of the soul expresses itself in the world of vision, where the soul inhabited
                        by the spirit has its being, and functions without the help of the material bodily
                        senses. There, in the realm of vision, the soul sees without the help of the physical
                        eye, hears without the aid of the physical ear, and travels without dependence upon
                        physical motion. It is, therefore, clear that the spirit in the soul of man can function
                        through the physical body by using the organs of the ordinary senses, and that it
                        is able also to live and act without their aid in the world of vision. This proves
                        without a doubt the superiority of the soul of man over his body, the superiority
                        of spirit over matter.

                        holds it? However beautiful the form of the lamp may be, if the light is not there
                        its purpose is unfulfilled, it is without life—a dead thing. The lamp needs the light,
                        but the light does not need the lamp.

                        <a id="607097966" class="brl-location"></a>Absolute repose does not exist in nature. All things either make progress or lose
                        ground. Everything moves forward or backward, nothing is without motion. From his
                        birth, a man progresses physically until he reaches maturity, then, having arrived
                        at the prime of his life, he begins to decline, the strength and powers of his body
                        decrease, and he gradually arrives at the hour of death. Likewise a plant progresses
                        from the  seed to maturity, then its life begins to lessen until it fades and dies.
                        A bird soars to a certain height and having reached the highest possible point in
                        its flight, begins its descent to earth.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="690671783" class="brl-location"></a>Thus it is evident that movement is essential to all existence. All material things
                        progress to a certain point, then begin to decline. This is the law which governs
                        the whole physical creation.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="982255238" class="brl-location"></a>Now let us consider the soul. We have seen that movement is essential to existence;
                        nothing that has life is without motion. All creation, whether of the mineral, vegetable
                        or animal kingdom, is compelled to obey the law of motion; it must either ascend or
                        descend. But with the human soul, there is no decline. Its only movement is towards
                        perfection; growth and progress alone constitute the motion of the soul.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="610561417" class="brl-location"></a>Divine perfection is infinite, therefore the progress of the soul is also infinite.
                        From the very birth of a human being the soul progresses, the intellect grows and
                        knowledge increases. When the body dies the soul lives on. All the differing degrees
                        of created physical beings are limited, but the soul is limitless!
                     </p>

                        <a id="847257337" class="brl-location"></a>In all religions the belief exists that the soul survives the death of the body. Intercessions
                        are sent up for the beloved dead, prayers are said for their progress and for the
                        forgiveness of their sins. If the soul perished with the body all this would have
                        no meaning. Further, if it were not possible for the soul to advance towards perfection
                        after it had been released from the body, of what avail are all these loving prayers,
                        of devotion?

                        <a id="287486383" class="brl-location"></a>The very fact that our spiritual instinct, surely never given in vain, prompts us
                        to pray for the welfare of those, our loved ones, who have passed out of the material
                        world: does it not bear witness to the continuance of their existence?

                        <a id="572763121" class="brl-location"></a>In the world of spirit there is no retrogression. The world of mortality is a world
                        of contradictions, of opposites; motion being compulsory everything must either go
                        forward or retreat. In the realm of spirit there is no retreat possible, all movement
                        is bound to be towards a perfect state. “Progress” is the expression of spirit in
                        the world of matter. The intelligence of man, his reasoning powers, his knowledge,
                        his scientific achievements, all these being manifestations of the spirit, partake
                        of the inevitable law of spiritual progress and are, therefore, of necessity, immortal.

                        world of matter; that your intelligence will develop, your knowledge will augment,

                        <a id="397365080" class="brl-location"></a>The whole physical creation is perishable. These material bodies are composed of atoms;
                        when these atoms begin to separate decomposition sets in, then comes what we call
                        death. This composition of atoms, which constitutes the body or mortal element of
                        any  created being, is temporary. When the power of attraction, which holds these
                        atoms together, is withdrawn, the body, as such, ceases to exist.

                        <a id="622507033" class="brl-location"></a>With the soul it is different. The soul is not a combination of elements, it is not
                        composed of many atoms, it is of one indivisible substance and therefore eternal.
                        It is entirely out of the order of the physical creation; it is immortal!

                        <a id="112701057" class="brl-location"></a>Scientific philosophy has demonstrated that a <span class="brl-italic">simple</span> element (“simple” meaning “not composed”) is indestructible, eternal. The soul, not
                        being a composition of elements, is, in character, as a simple element, and therefore
                        cannot cease to exist.

                        <a id="905737218" class="brl-location"></a>The soul, being of that one indivisible substance, can suffer neither disintegration
                        nor destruction, therefore there is no reason for its coming to an end. All things
                        living show signs of their existence, and it follows that these signs could not of
                        themselves exist if that which they express or to which they testify had no being.
                        A thing which does not exist, can, of course, give no sign of its existence. The manifold
                        signs of the existence of the spirit are forever before us.

                        must exist—one who does not exist cannot write. Writing is, in itself, a sign of the
                        writer’s soul and intelligence. The Sacred Writings (with ever the same Teaching)
                        prove the continuity of the spirit.

                        through countless ages with this small goal in view—a few years of a man’s life on
                        earth? Is it not unthinkable that this should be the final aim of existence?

                        till finally it loses its life in that of the animal; the animal, in its turn, forming

                        comprehend the vegetable world. Now, that lack of comprehension does not prove the
                        nonexistence of the plant!
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="765596883" class="brl-location"></a>To however great a degree the plant may have evolved, it is unable to understand the
                        animal world; this ignorance is no proof that the animal does not exist!
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="570309299" class="brl-location"></a>The animal, be he never so highly developed, cannot imagine the intelligence of man,
                        neither can he realize  the nature of his soul. But, again, this does not prove that
                        man is without intellect, or without soul. It only demonstrates this, that one form
                        of existence is incapable of comprehending a form superior to itself.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="082991101" class="brl-location"></a>This flower may be unconscious of such a being as man, but the fact of its ignorance
                        does not prevent the existence of humanity.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="316469837" class="brl-location"></a>In the same way, if materialists do not believe in the existence of the soul, their
                        unbelief does not prove that there is no such realm as the world of spirit. The very
                        existence of man’s intelligence proves his immortality; moreover, darkness proves
                        the presence of light, for without light there would be no shadow. Poverty proves
                        the existence of riches, for, without riches, how could we measure poverty? Ignorance
                        proves that knowledge exists, for without knowledge how could there be ignorance?
                     </p>

                        <a id="964269120" class="brl-location"></a>Therefore the idea of mortality presupposes the existence of immortality—for if there
                        were no Life Eternal, there would be no way of measuring the life of this world!

                        If a man reflects he will understand the spiritual significance of the law of progress;
                        how all moves from the inferior to the superior degree.

                        no understanding; having eyes they see not, ears they have, but do not hear. And this
                        lack of sight and hearing is a proof of nothing but their own inferiority; of whom
                        we read in the Qur’án, “They are men who are blind and deaf to the Spirit.” They do
                        not use that great gift of God, the power of the understanding, by which they might

                        <span class="brl-uppercase">There</span> are in the world of humanity three degrees; those of the body, the soul, and spirit.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="805798809" class="brl-location"></a>The body is the physical or animal degree of man. From the bodily point of view man
                        is a sharer of the animal kingdom. The bodies alike of men and animals are composed
                        of elements held together by the law of attraction.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="746616279" class="brl-location"></a>Like the animal, man possesses the faculties of the senses, is subject to heat, cold,
                        hunger, thirst, etc.; unlike the animal, man has a rational soul, the human intelligence.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="642252759" class="brl-location"></a>This intelligence of man is the intermediary between his body and his spirit.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="961947910" class="brl-location"></a>When man allows the spirit, through his soul, to enlighten his understanding, then
                        does he contain all Creation; because man, being the culmination of all that went
                        before and thus superior to all previous  evolutions, contains all the lower world
                        within himself. Illumined by the spirit through the instrumentality of the soul, man’s
                        radiant intelligence makes him the crowning-point of Creation.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="543865101" class="brl-location"></a>But on the other hand, when man does not open his mind and heart to the blessing of
                        the spirit, but turns his soul towards the material side, towards the bodily part
                        of his nature, then is he fallen from his high place and he becomes inferior to the
                        inhabitants of the lower animal kingdom. In this case the man is in a sorry plight!
                        For if the spiritual qualities of the soul, open to the breath of the Divine Spirit,
                        are never used, they become atrophied, enfeebled, and at last incapable; whilst the
                        soul’s material qualities alone being exercised, they become terribly powerful—and
                        the unhappy, misguided man, becomes more savage, more unjust, more vile, more cruel,
                        more malevolent than the lower animals themselves. All his aspirations and desires
                        being strengthened by the lower side of the soul’s nature, he becomes more and more
                        brutal, until his whole being is in no way superior to that of the beasts that perish.
                        Men such as this plan to work evil, to hurt and to destroy; they are entirely without
                        the spirit of Divine compassion, for the celestial quality of the soul has been dominated
                        by that of the material. If, on the contrary, the spiritual nature of the soul has
                        been so strengthened that it holds the material side in subjection, then does the
                        man approach the Divine; his humanity becomes so glorified that the virtues of the
                        Celestial Assembly are manifested in him; he radiates the Mercy of God, he stimulates
                        the  spiritual progress of mankind, for he becomes a lamp to show light on their path.
                     </p>

                        <a id="466606329" class="brl-location"></a>You perceive how the soul is the intermediary between the body and the spirit. In
                        like manner is this tree<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#884446327">1</a></sup> the intermediary between the seed and the fruit. When the fruit of the tree appears
                        and becomes ripe, then we know that the tree is perfect; if the tree bore no fruit
                        it would be merely a useless growth, serving no purpose!

                        <a id="935086171" class="brl-location"></a>When a soul has in it the life of the spirit, then does it bring forth good fruit
                        and become a Divine tree. I wish you to try to understand this example. I hope that
                        the unspeakable goodness of God will so strengthen you that the celestial quality
                        of your soul, which relates it to the spirit, will forever dominate the material side,

                        Radiance dominating your souls, so that in the gatherings of the world you will show
                        perfection in your life.

                        <a id="247298635" class="brl-location"></a>Some men’s lives are solely occupied with the things of this world; their minds are
                        so circumscribed by exterior manners and traditional interests that they are blind
                        to any other realm of existence, to the spiritual significance of all things! They
                        think and dream of earthly fame, of material progress. Sensuous delights and comfortable
                        surroundings bound their horizon,  their highest ambitions center in successes of
                        worldly conditions and circumstances! They curb not their lower propensities; they
                        eat, drink, and sleep! Like the animal, they have no thought beyond their own physical
                        well-being. It is true that these necessities must be dispatched. Life is a load which
                        must be carried on while we are on earth, but the cares of the lower things of life
                        should not be allowed to monopolize all the thoughts and aspirations of a human being.
                        The heart’s ambitions should ascend to a more glorious goal, mental activity should
                        rise to higher levels! Men should hold in their souls the vision of celestial perfection,
                        and there prepare a dwelling-place for the inexhaustible bounty of the Divine Spirit.

                        the garden, and behold, he finds it well tilled; the branches of the trees are sturdy

                        Moses was a murderer, that he had slain a man and deserved to be executed! He also
                        declared that Moses and Aaron were fomenters of discord, that they tried to destroy
                        the religion of Egypt and therefore must be put to death. These words of Pharaoh were
                        vainly spoken. The light of Moses shone. The radiance of the Law of God has encircled

                        <span class="brl-uppercase">Ferocity</span> and savagery are natural to animals, but men should show forth the qualities of love
                        and affection. God sent all His Prophets into the world with one aim, to sow in the
                        hearts of men love and goodwill, and for this great purpose they were willing to suffer
                        and to die. All the sacred Books were written to lead and direct man into the ways
                        of love and unity; and yet, in spite of all this, we have the sad spectacle of war
                        and bloodshed in our midst.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="430199240" class="brl-location"></a>When we look into the pages of history, past and present, we see the black earth reddened
                        by human  blood. Men kill each other like the savage wolves, and forget the laws of
                        love and tolerance.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="059050939" class="brl-location"></a>Now this luminous age has come, bringing with it wonderful civilization and material
                        progress. Men’s intellects have widened, their perceptions grown, but alas, in spite
                        of all this, fresh blood is being spilt day by day. Look at the present Turco-Italian
                        war; consider for a moment the fate of these unhappy people! How many have been killed
                        during this sad time? How many homes are ruined, wives desolate, and children orphans!
                        And what is to be gained in exchange for all this anguish and heartache? Only a corner
                        of the earth!
                     </p>

                        <a id="047973057" class="brl-location"></a>This all shows that material progress alone does not tend to uplift man. On the contrary,
                        the more he becomes immersed in material progress, the more does his spirituality
                        become obscured.
                     </p>

                        <a id="818619672" class="brl-location"></a>In times gone by progress on the material plane was not so rapid, neither was there
                        bloodshed in such profusion. In ancient warfare there were no cannons, no guns, no
                        dynamite, no shells, no torpedo boats, no battleships, no submarines. Now, owing to
                        material civilization, we have all these inventions, and war goes from bad to worse!
                        Europe itself has become like one immense arsenal, full of explosives, and may God
                        prevent its ignition—for, should this happen, the whole world would be involved.

                        <a id="407182695" class="brl-location"></a>I want to make you understand that <span class="brl-italic">material</span> progress and spiritual progress are two very different things, and that only if material
                        progress goes hand in hand with spirituality can any real progress come about, and
                        the Most Great Peace reign in the world. If men followed the Holy Counsels and the
                        Teachings of the Prophets, if Divine Light shone in all hearts and men were really
                        religious, we should soon see peace on earth and the Kingdom of God among men. The
                        laws of God may be likened unto the soul and material progress unto the body. If the
                        body were not animated by the soul, it would cease to exist. It is my earnest prayer
                        that spirituality may ever grow and increase in the world, so that customs may become
                        enlightened and peace and concord may be established.

                        <a id="032260883" class="brl-location"></a>War and rapine with their attendant cruelties are an abomination to God, and bring
                        their own punishment, for the God of love is also a God of justice and each man must
                        inevitably reap what he sows. Let us try to understand the commands of the Most High
                        and to order our lives as He directs. True happiness depends on spiritual good and
                        having the heart ever open to receive the Divine Bounty.
                     </p>

                        <a id="010271882" class="brl-location"></a>If the heart turns away from the blessings God offers how can it hope for happiness?
                        If it does not put its hope and trust in God’s Mercy, where can it find rest? Oh,
                        trust in God! for His Bounty is everlasting, and in His Blessings, for they are superb.
                        Oh! put your faith in the Almighty, for He faileth not and His goodness endureth forever!
                        His Sun giveth Light continually, and the Clouds of His Mercy are full of the Waters
                        of Compassion with which He waters the hearts of all who trust in Him. His refreshing
                        Breeze ever carries healing in its wings to the parched souls of men! Is it wise to
                        turn away from such a loving Father, Who  showers His blessings upon us, and to choose
                        rather to be slaves of matter?

                        <a id="350441448" class="brl-location"></a>God in His infinite goodness has exalted us to so much honor, and has made us masters
                        over the material world. Shall we then become her slaves? Nay, rather let us claim
                        our birthright, and strive to live the life of the spiritual sons of God. The glorious
                        Sun of Truth has once again risen in the East. From the far horizon of Persia its
                        radiance is spreading far and wide, dispersing the dense clouds of superstition. The
                        light of the unity of mankind is beginning to illumine the world, and soon the banner
                        of Divine harmony and the solidarity of nations will be flying high in the Heavens.
                        Yea, the breezes of the Holy Spirit will inspire the whole world!

                        leaves us, our comprehension is dim and our intelligence veiled. The actualities of
                        life seem to elude our grasp,  the eyes of our spirits fail to discover the sacred

                        <a id="292573874" class="brl-location"></a>When our thoughts are filled with the bitterness of this world, let us turn our eyes
                        to the sweetness of God’s compassion and He will send us heavenly calm! If we are
                        imprisoned in the material world, our spirit can soar into the Heavens and we shall
                        be free indeed!
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="536741092" class="brl-location"></a>When our days are drawing to a close let us think of the eternal worlds, and we shall
                        be full of joy!
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="263920664" class="brl-location"></a>You see all round you proofs of the inadequacy of material things—how joy, comfort,
                        peace and consolation are not to be found in the transitory things of the world. Is
                        it not then foolishness to refuse to seek these treasures where they may be found?
                        The doors of the spiritual Kingdom are open to all, and without is absolute darkness.
                     </p>

                        <a id="906201340" class="brl-location"></a>Thank God that you in this assembly have this knowledge, for in all the sorrows of
                        life you can obtain supreme consolation. If your days on earth are numbered, you know
                        that everlasting life awaits you. If material anxiety envelops you in a dark cloud,
                        spiritual radiance lightens your path. Verily, those whose minds are illumined by
                        the Spirit of the Most High have supreme consolation.

                        <a id="857225832" class="brl-location"></a>I myself was in prison forty years—one year alone would have been impossible to bear—nobody
                        survived that imprisonment more than a year! But, thank God, during all those forty
                        years I was supremely happy!  Every day, on waking, it was like hearing good tidings,
                        and every night infinite joy was mine. Spirituality was my comfort, and turning to
                        God was my greatest joy. If this had not been so, do you think it possible that I
                        could have lived through those forty years in prison?
                     </p>

                        <a id="417194892" class="brl-location"></a>Thus, spirituality is the greatest of God’s gifts, and “Life Everlasting” means “Turning
                        to God.” May you, one and all, increase daily in spirituality, may you be strengthened
                        in all goodness, may you be helped more and more by the Divine consolation, be made
                        free by the Holy Spirit of God, and may the power of the Heavenly Kingdom live and
                        work among you.

                        happiness  to others. Your greatest longing is to comfort those who mourn, to strengthen
                        the weak, and to be the cause of hope to the despairing soul. Day and night your thoughts
                        are turned to the Kingdom, and your hearts are full of the Love of God.

                        <a id="256807289" class="brl-location"></a>I have just been told that there has been a terrible accident in this country. A train
                        has fallen into the river and at least twenty people have been killed. This is going
                        to be a matter for discussion in the French Parliament today, and the Director of
                        the State Railway will be called upon to speak. He will be cross-examined as to the
                        condition of the railroad and as to what caused the accident, and there will be a
                        heated argument. I am filled with wonder and surprise to notice what interest and
                        excitement has been aroused throughout the whole country on account of the death of
                        twenty people, while they remain cold and indifferent to the fact that thousands of
                        Italians, Turks,  and Arabs are killed in Tripoli! The horror of this wholesale slaughter
                        has not disturbed the Government at all! Yet these unfortunate people are human beings
                        too.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="668392360" class="brl-location"></a>Why is there so much interest and eager sympathy shown towards these twenty individuals,
                        while for five thousand persons there is none? They are all men, they all belong to
                        the family of mankind, but they are of other lands and races. It is no concern of
                        the disinterested countries if these men are cut to pieces, this wholesale slaughter
                        does not affect them! How unjust, how cruel is this, how utterly devoid of any good
                        and true feeling! The people of these other lands have children and wives, mothers,
                        daughters, and little sons! In these countries today there is hardly a house free
                        from the sound of bitter weeping, scarcely can one find a home untouched by the cruel
                        hand of war.
                     </p>

                        <a id="671688276" class="brl-location"></a>Alas! we see on all sides how cruel, prejudiced and unjust is man, and how slow he
                        is to believe in God and follow His commandments.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="117084930" class="brl-location"></a>If these people would love and help one another instead of being so eager to destroy
                        with sword and cannon, how much nobler would it be! How much better if they would
                        live like a flock of doves in peace and harmony, instead of being like wolves and
                        tearing each other to pieces.

                        <a id="148105928" class="brl-location"></a>Why is man so hard of heart? It is because he does not yet know God. If he had knowledge
                        of God he could not act in direct opposition to His laws; if he were spiritually minded
                        such a line of conduct would be impossible to him. If only the laws and precepts of
                        the prophets of God had been believed, understood and followed, wars would no longer
                        darken the face of the earth.

                        <a id="791515675" class="brl-location"></a>Therefore, I say unto you pray—pray and turn your faces to God, that He, in His infinite
                        compassion and mercy, may help and succor these misguided ones. Pray that He will
                        grant them spiritual understanding and teach them tolerance and mercy, that the eyes
                        of their minds may be opened and that they may be endued with the gift of the spirit.
                        Then would peace and love walk hand in hand through the lands, and these poor unhappy
                        people might have rest.

                        <a id="689005945" class="brl-location"></a>Let us all strive night and day to help in the bringing about of better conditions.
                        My heart is broken by these terrible things and cries aloud—may this cry reach other
                        hearts!

                        of God, He invited them to Eternal Life and He told them to acquire human perfections.
                        The Light of Guidance  was shed forth by that radiant Star, and He at length gave
                        His life in sacrifice for humanity.

                        <a id="821443517" class="brl-location"></a>All through His blessed life He suffered oppression and hardship, and in spite of
                        all this humanity was His enemy!

                        <a id="860190281" class="brl-location"></a>They denied Him, scorned Him, ill-treated Him and cursed Him. He was not treated like
                        a man—and yet in spite of all this He was the embodiment of pity and of supreme goodness
                        and love.
                     </p>

                        <a id="869212812" class="brl-location"></a>He loved all humanity, but they treated Him as an enemy and were incapable of appreciating
                        Him. They set no value on His words and were not illumined by the flame of His love.
                     </p>

                        <a id="683836379" class="brl-location"></a>Later they realized who He was; that He was the Sacred and Divine Light, and that

                        <a id="606204252" class="brl-location"></a>His heart was full of love for all the world, His goodness was destined to reach each
                        one—and as they began to realize these things, they repented—but He had been crucified!
                     </p>

                        <a id="267332287" class="brl-location"></a>It was not until many years after His ascension that they knew who He was, and at
                        the time of His ascension He had only a very few disciples; only a comparatively small
                        following believed His precepts and followed His laws. The ignorant said, “Who is
                        this individual; He has only a few disciples!” But those who knew said: “He is the
                        Sun who will shine in the East and in the West, He is the Manifestation who shall
                        give life to the world.”

                        people think that your Cause is of no importance. If few people come to your gatherings
                        do not lose heart, and if you are ridiculed and contradicted be not distressed, for
                        the apostles of Christ had the same to bear. They were reviled and persecuted, cursed
                        and ill-treated, but in the end they were victorious and their enemies were found
                        to be wrong.

                        not be saddened but be full of joy, and thank God that you are called upon to suffer
                        as holy men of old suffered. If they oppose you be gentle with them, if they contradict
                        be firm in your faith, if they desert you and flee from before you, seek them out
                        and treat them kindly. Do harm to nobody; pray for all; try to make your light shine
                        in the world and let your banner fly high in the Heavens. The beautiful perfume of
                        your noble lives will permeate everywhere. The light of truth kindled in your hearts
                        will shine out to the distant horizon!

                        that day by day true love and affection may grow among us. God has willed that love
                        should be a vital force in the world, and you all know how I rejoice to speak of love.

                        <a id="376570282" class="brl-location"></a>All down the ages the prophets of God have been sent into the world to serve the cause
                        of truth—Moses brought the law of truth, and all the prophets of Israel after him
                        sought to spread it.
                     </p>

                        <a id="285458566" class="brl-location"></a>When Jesus came He lighted the flaming torch of truth, and carried it aloft so that
                        the whole world might be illumined thereby. After Him came His chosen apostles, and
                        they went far and wide, carrying the light of their Master’s teaching into a dark
                        world—and, in their turn, passed on.

                        <a id="633107621" class="brl-location"></a>Then came Muḥammad, who in His time and way spread the knowledge of truth among a
                        savage people; for this has always been the mission of God’s elect.

                        <a id="928991948" class="brl-location"></a>So, at last, when Bahá’u’lláh arose in Persia, this was His most ardent desire, to
                        rekindle the waning light of truth in all lands. All the holy ones of God have tried
                        with heart and soul to spread the light of love and unity throughout the world, so
                        that the darkness of materiality might disappear and the light of spirituality might
                        shine forth among the children of men. Then  would hate, slander and murder disappear,
                        and in their stead love, unity and peace would reign.

                        to lead men into the paths of virtue. Yet we, their servants, still dispute among
                        ourselves! Why is it thus? Why do we not love one another and live in unity?

                        <a id="193468580" class="brl-location"></a>It is because we have shut our eyes to the underlying principle of all religions,
                        that God is one, that He is the Father of us all, that we are all immersed in the
                        ocean of His mercy and sheltered and protected by His loving care.

                        <a id="536568737" class="brl-location"></a>This loving God desires peace for all His creatures—why, then, do they spend their

                        <a id="647061393" class="brl-location"></a>He loves and protects all His children—why do they forget Him?

                        <a id="314613061" class="brl-location"></a>He bestows His Fatherly care on us all—why do we neglect our brothers?
                     </p>

                        <a id="553803723" class="brl-location"></a>Surely, when we realize how God loves and cares for us, we should so order our lives
                        that we may become more like Him.
                     </p>

                        <a id="995719640" class="brl-location"></a>God has created us, one and all—why do we act in opposition to His wishes, when we
                        are all His children, and love the same Father? All these divisions we see on all
                        sides, all these disputes and opposition, are caused because men cling to <span class="brl-italic">ritual</span> and outward observances, and forget the simple, underlying truth. It is the <span class="brl-italic">outward practices</span> of religion that are so different, and  it is they that cause disputes and enmity—while
                        the <span class="brl-italic">reality</span> is always the same, and one. The Reality is the Truth, and truth has no division.
                        Truth is God’s guidance, it is the light of the world, it is love, it is mercy. These
                        attributes of truth are also human virtues inspired by the Holy Spirit.

                        <a id="248319187" class="brl-location"></a>So let us one and all hold fast to truth, and we shall be free indeed!

                        <a id="484930644" class="brl-location"></a>The day is coming when all the religions of the world will unite, for in principle
                        they are one already. There is no need for division, seeing that it is only the outward
                        forms that separate them. Among the sons of men some souls are suffering through ignorance,
                        let us hasten to teach them; others are like children needing care and education until
                        they are grown, and some are sick—to these we must carry Divine healing.
                     </p>

                        <a id="911533512" class="brl-location"></a>Whether ignorant, childish or sick, they must be loved and helped, and not disliked
                        because of their imperfection.

                        <a id="807910828" class="brl-location"></a>Doctors of religion were instituted to bring spiritual healing to the peoples and
                        to be the cause of unity among the nations. If they become the cause of division they
                        had better not exist! A remedy is given to cure a disease, but if it only succeeds
                        in aggravating the complaint, it is better to leave it alone. If religion is only
                        to be a cause of disunion it had better not exist.

                        <a id="332209653" class="brl-location"></a>All the Divine Manifestations sent by God into the world would have gone through their
                        terrible hardships and sufferings for the single hope of spreading Truth, unity and
                        concord among men. Christ endured a life of sorrow, pain and grief, to bring a perfect
                        example of love into the world—and in spite of this we continue to act in a contrary
                        spirit one towards the other!

                        <a id="662700837" class="brl-location"></a>Love is the fundamental principle of God’s purpose for man, and He has commanded us
                        to love each other even as He loves us. All these discords and disputes which we hear
                        on all sides only tend to increase materiality.

                        <a id="398795421" class="brl-location"></a>The world for the most part is sunk in materialism, and the blessings of the Holy
                        Spirit are ignored. There is so little real spiritual feeling, and the progress of
                        the world is for the most part merely material. Men are becoming like unto beasts
                        that perish, for we know that they have no spiritual feeling—they do not turn to God,
                        they have no religion! These things belong to man alone, and if he is without them
                        he is a prisoner of nature, and no whit better than an animal.

                        <a id="738839307" class="brl-location"></a>How can man be content to lead only an animal existence when God has made him so high
                        a creature? All creation is made subject to the laws of nature, but man has been able
                        to conquer these laws. The sun, in spite of its power and glory, is bound by the laws
                        of nature, and cannot change its course by so much as a hair’s breadth. The great
                        and mighty ocean is powerless to change the ebb and flow of its tides—nothing can
                        stand against nature’s laws but man!

                        imprisons it in a lamp! The human voice is made to speak across short distances, but
                        man’s power is such that he has made instruments and can speak from East to West!
                        All these examples show you how man can govern nature, and how, as it were, he wrests
                        a sword from the hand of nature and uses it against herself. Seeing that man has been
                        created master of nature, how foolish it is of him to become her slave! What ignorance
                        and stupidity it is to worship and adore nature, when God in His goodness has made
                        us masters thereof. God’s power is visible to all, yet men shut their eyes and see
                        it not. The Sun of Truth is shining in all His splendor, but man with fast shut eyes
                        cannot behold His glory! It is my earnest prayer to God that by His Mercy and Loving
                        Kindness you may all be united, and filled with the utmost joy.

                        it is composed of honored and respected men. You are men of intellect and thought,
                        men with spiritual ideals, and it is a great pleasure for me to be among you.

                        <a id="914290725" class="brl-location"></a>Let us thank God who has drawn us together this evening. It gives me great joy, for
                        I see that you are seekers after truth. You are not held in bondage by the chains
                        of prejudice, and your greatest longing is to know the truth. Truth may be likened
                        to the sun! The sun is the luminous body that disperses all  shadows; in the same
                        way does truth scatter the shadows of our imagination. As the sun gives life to the
                        body of humanity so does truth give life to their souls. Truth is a sun that rises
                        from different points on the horizon.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="894557472" class="brl-location"></a>Sometimes the sun rises from the center of the horizon, then in summer it rises farther
                        north, in winter farther south—but it is always the self-same sun, however different
                        are the points of its rising.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="707867940" class="brl-location"></a>In like manner truth is one, although its manifestations may be very different. Some
                        men have eyes and see. These worship the sun, no matter from which point on the horizon
                        it may dawn; and when the sun has left the winter sky to appear in the summer one,
                        they know how to find it again. Others there are who worship only the spot from which
                        the sun arose, and when it arises in its glory from another place they remain in contemplation
                        before the spot of its former rising. Alas! these men are deprived of the blessings
                        of the sun. Those who in truth adore the sun itself will recognize it from whatsoever
                        dawning-place it may appear, and will straightway turn their faces towards its radiance.
                     </p>

                        <a id="661828997" class="brl-location"></a>We must adore the sun itself and not merely the place of its appearance. In the same
                        way men of enlightened heart worship truth on whatever horizon it appears. They are
                        not bound by personality, but they follow the truth, and are able to recognize it
                        no matter from whence it may come. It is this same truth which helps humanity to progress,
                        which gives life to all created beings, for it is the Tree of Life!

                        <a id="334444343" class="brl-location"></a>Man must cut himself free from all prejudice and from the result of his own imagination,
                        so that he may be able to search for truth unhindered. Truth is one in all religions,
                        and by means of it the unity of the world can be realized.

                        and the differences that appear to exist among the nations only result from their
                        attachment to prejudice. If only men would search out truth, they would find themselves
                        united.

                        <a id="599308795" class="brl-location"></a>The one all-loving God bestows His divine Grace and Favor on all mankind; one and
                        all are servants of the Most High, and His Goodness, Mercy and loving Kindness are
                        showered upon all His creatures. The glory of humanity is the heritage of each one.

                        same warm sun makes them grow, they are all refreshed by the same breeze. The only
                        differences that exist and that keep them apart are these: there are the  children
                        who need guidance, the ignorant to be instructed, the sick to be tended and healed;
                        thus, I say that the whole of humanity is enveloped by the Mercy and Grace of God.
                        As the Holy Writings tell us: All men are equal before God. He is no respecter of
                        persons.

                        <a id="073612315" class="brl-location"></a>The third principle of Bahá’u’lláh is: <br/>
                        <span class="brl-align-center brl-italic brl-displayblock brl-topmargin brl-btmmargin">Religion should be the Cause of Love and Affection</span>

                        <a id="089115387" class="brl-location"></a>Religion should unite all hearts and cause wars and disputes to vanish from the face
                        of the earth, give birth to spirituality, and bring life and light to each heart.
                        If religion becomes a cause of dislike, hatred and division, it were better to be
                        without it, and to withdraw from such a religion would be a truly religious act. For
                        it is clear that the purpose of a remedy is to cure; but if the remedy should only
                        aggravate the complaint it had better be left alone. Any religion which is not a cause
                        of love and unity is no religion. All the holy prophets were as doctors to the soul;
                        they gave prescriptions for the healing of mankind; thus any remedy that causes disease
                        does not come from the great and supreme Physician.

                        for flight, one alone would be useless. Any religion that contradicts science  or
                        that is opposed to it, is only ignorance—for ignorance is the opposite of knowledge.

                        religion ought not to accept. Religion and science walk hand in hand, and any religion
                        contrary to science is not the truth.

                        of man’s making only, and are necessary only in his thought; before God there are
                        neither Persians, Arabs, French nor English; God is God for all, and to Him all creation

                        and the greatest comfort, so should a poor man be able to have the necessaries of
                        life. Nobody should die of hunger; everybody should have sufficient clothing; one
                        man should not live in excess while another has no possible means of existence.

                        it is the soul that animates the body; the body alone has no real significance. Deprived
                        of the blessings of the Holy Spirit the material body would be inert.

                        <a id="378940843" class="brl-location"></a>In short, it behooves us all to be lovers of truth. Let us seek her in every season
                        and in every country, being  careful never to attach ourselves to personalities. Let
                        us see the light wherever it shines, and may we be enabled to recognize the light
                        of truth no matter where it may arise. Let us inhale the perfume of the rose from
                        the midst of thorns which surround it; let us drink the running water from every pure
                        spring.

                        you are, for praise be to God, you are intelligent, unprejudiced, and you long to
                        know the truth. You have in your hearts the love of humanity, and as far as you are
                        able, you exert yourselves in the cause of charitable work and in the bringing about
                        of unity; this is especially what Bahá’u’lláh desired.

                        <a id="339436637" class="brl-location"></a>The Jews have traditional superstitions, the Buddhists and the Zoroastrians are not
                        free from them, neither are the Christians! All religions have gradually become bound
                        by tradition and dogma.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="875711332" class="brl-location"></a>All consider themselves, respectively, the only guardians of the truth, and that every
                        other religion is composed of errors. They themselves are right, all others are wrong!
                        The Jews believe that they are the only possessors of the truth and condemn all other
                        religions. The Christians affirm that their religion is the only true one, that all
                        others are false. Likewise the Buddhists and Muḥammadans; all limit themselves. If
                        all condemn one another, where shall we search for truth? All contradicting one another,
                        all cannot be true. If each believe his particular religion to be the only true one,
                        he blinds his eyes to the truth in the others. If, for instance, a Jew is bound by
                        the external practice of the religion of Israel, he does not permit himself to perceive
                        that truth <span class="brl-italic">can</span> exist in any other religion; it must be <span class="brl-italic">all</span> contained in his own! 
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="542114388" class="brl-location"></a>We should, therefore, detach ourselves from the external forms and practices of religion.
                        We must realize that these forms and practices, however beautiful, are but garments
                        clothing the warm heart and the living limbs of Divine truth. We must abandon the
                        prejudices of tradition if we would succeed in finding the truth at the core of all
                        religions. If a Zoroastrian believes that the Sun is God, how can he be united to
                        other religions? While idolaters believe in their various idols, how can they understand
                        the oneness of God?
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="956983272" class="brl-location"></a>It is, therefore, clear that in order to make any progress in the search after truth
                        we must relinquish superstition. If all seekers would follow this principle they would
                        obtain a clear vision of the truth.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="068113036" class="brl-location"></a>If five people meet together to seek for truth, they must begin by cutting themselves
                        free from all their own special conditions and renouncing all preconceived ideas.
                        In order to find truth we must give up our prejudices, our own small trivial notions;
                        an open receptive mind is essential. If our chalice is full of self, there is no room
                        in it for the water of life. The fact that we imagine ourselves to be right and everybody
                        else wrong is the greatest of all obstacles in the path towards unity, and unity is
                        necessary if we would reach truth, for truth is <span class="brl-italic">one.</span>
                        
                     </p>

                        <a id="360118382" class="brl-location"></a>Therefore it is imperative that we should renounce our own particular prejudices and
                        superstitions if we earnestly desire to seek the truth. Unless we make a distinction
                        in our minds between dogma, superstition and prejudice on the one hand, and truth
                        on the other, we cannot succeed. When we are in earnest in our  search for anything
                        we look for it everywhere. This principle we must carry out in our search for truth.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="141863418" class="brl-location"></a>Science must be accepted. No one truth can contradict another truth. Light is good
                        in whatsoever lamp it is burning! A rose is beautiful in whatsoever garden it may
                        bloom! A star has the same radiance if it shines from the East or from the West. Be
                        free from prejudice, so will you love the Sun of Truth from whatsoever point in the
                        horizon it may arise! You will realize that if the Divine light of truth shone in
                        Jesus Christ it also shone in Moses and in Buddha. The earnest seeker will arrive
                        at this truth. This is what is meant by the “Search after Truth.”
                     </p>

                        <a id="388697817" class="brl-location"></a>It means, also, that we must be willing to clear away all that we have previously
                        learned, all that would clog our steps on the way to truth; we must not shrink if
                        necessary from beginning our education all over again. We must not allow our love
                        for any one religion or any one personality to so blind our eyes that we become fettered
                        by superstition! When we are freed from all these bonds, seeking with liberated minds,
                        then shall we be able to arrive at our goal.

                        <span class="brl-uppercase">I spoke</span> yesterday of the first principle of the Teaching of Bahá’u’lláh, “The Search for
                        Truth”; how it is necessary for a man to put aside all in the nature of superstition,
                        and every tradition which would blind his eyes to the existence of truth in all religions.
                        He must not, while loving and clinging to one form of religion, permit himself to
                        detest all others. It is essential that he search for truth in all religions, and,
                        if his seeking be in earnest, he will assuredly succeed.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="609693944" class="brl-location"></a>Now the first discovery which we make in our “Search after Truth,” will lead us to
                        the second principle, which is the “Unity of Mankind.” All men are servants of the
                        One God. One God reigns over all the nations of the world and has pleasure in all
                        His children. All men are of one family; the crown of humanity rests on the head of
                        every human being.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="047985280" class="brl-location"></a>In the eyes of the Creator all His children are equal; His goodness is poured forth
                        on all. He does not favor this nation nor that nation, all alike are His creatures.
                        This being so, why should we make divisions, separating one race from another? Why
                        should we create barriers of superstition and tradition bringing discord and hatred
                        among the people?
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="126150641" class="brl-location"></a>The only difference between members of the human family is that of degree. Some are
                        like children who are ignorant, and must be educated until they arrive at maturity.
                        Some are like the sick and must be treated  with tenderness and care. None are bad
                        or evil! We must not be repelled by these poor children. We must treat them with great
                        kindness, teaching the ignorant and tenderly nursing the sick.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="471776836" class="brl-location"></a>Consider: Unity is necessary to existence. Love is the very cause of life; on the
                        other hand, separation brings death. In the world of material creation, for instance,
                        all things owe their actual life to unity. The elements which compose wood, mineral,
                        or stone, are held together by the law of attraction. If this law should cease for
                        one moment to operate these elements would not hold together, they would fall apart,
                        and the object would in that particular form cease to exist. The law of attraction
                        has brought together certain elements in the form of this beautiful flower, but when
                        that attraction is withdrawn from this center the flower will decompose, and, as a
                        flower, cease to exist.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="593841904" class="brl-location"></a>So it is with the great body of humanity. The wonderful Law of Attraction, Harmony
                        and Unity, holds together this marvelous Creation.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="865640966" class="brl-location"></a>As with the whole, so with the parts; whether a flower or a human body, when the attracting
                        principle is withdrawn from it, the flower or the man dies. It is therefore clear
                        that attraction, harmony, unity and Love, are the cause of life, whereas repulsion,
                        discord, hatred and separation bring death.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="612197641" class="brl-location"></a>We have seen that whatever brings division into the world of existence causes death.
                        Likewise in the world of the spirit does the same law operate.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="673748696" class="brl-location"></a>Therefore should every servant of the One God be obedient to the law of love, avoiding
                        all hatred,  discord, and strife. We find when we observe nature, that the gentler
                        animals group themselves together into flocks and herds, whereas the savage, ferocious
                        creatures, such as the lion, the tiger, and the wolf, live in wild forests, apart
                        from civilization. Two wolves, or two lions, may live amicably together; but a thousand
                        lambs may share the same fold and a large number of deer can form one herd. Two eagles
                        can dwell in the same place, but a thousand doves can gather into one habitation.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="671841839" class="brl-location"></a>Man should, at least, be numbered among the gentler animals; but when he becomes ferocious
                        he is more cruel and malicious than the most savage of the animal creation!
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="906837142" class="brl-location"></a>Now Bahá’u’lláh has proclaimed the “Unity of the World of Mankind.” All peoples and
                        nations are of one family, the children of one Father, and should be to one another
                        as brothers and sisters! I hope that you will endeavor in your lives to show forth
                        and spread this teaching.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="671510708" class="brl-location"></a>Bahá’u’lláh said that we should love even our enemies and be to them as friends. If
                        all men were obedient to this principle, the greatest unity and understanding would
                        be established in the hearts of mankind.

                        <a id="589872266" class="brl-location"></a>I have spoken to you of some of the principles of Bahá’u’lláh: <span class="brl-italic">The Search after Truth</span> and <span class="brl-italic">The Unity of Mankind</span>. I will now explain the <span class="brl-italic">Fourth Principle</span>, which is <span class="brl-italic">The Acceptance of the Relation between Religion and Science</span>.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="538553680" class="brl-location"></a>There is no contradiction between true religion and science. When a religion is opposed
                        to science it becomes mere superstition: that which is contrary to knowledge is ignorance.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="071525162" class="brl-location"></a>How can a man believe to be a fact that which science has proved to be impossible?
                        If he believes in spite of his reason, it is rather ignorant superstition than faith.
                        The true principles of all religions are in conformity with the teachings of science.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="915568907" class="brl-location"></a>The Unity of God is logical, and this idea is not antagonistic to the conclusions
                        arrived at by scientific study.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="727098050" class="brl-location"></a>All religions teach that we must do good, that we must be generous, sincere, truthful,
                        law-abiding, and faithful; all this is reasonable, and logically the only way in which
                        humanity can progress.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="468002649" class="brl-location"></a>All religious laws conform to reason, and are suited  to the people for whom they
                        are framed, and for the age in which they are to be obeyed.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="773753686" class="brl-location"></a>Religion has two main parts:
                        <span class="brl-linegroup brl-margin-4">
                           <span class="brl-linegroupline">(1) The Spiritual.</span>
                           <span class="brl-linegroupline">(2) The Practical.</span>
                           </span>
                        
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="117122505" class="brl-location"></a>The spiritual part never changes. All the Manifestations of God and His Prophets have
                        taught the same truths and given the same spiritual law. They all teach the one code
                        of morality. There is no division in the truth. The Sun has sent forth many rays to
                        illumine human intelligence, the light is always the same.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="416304088" class="brl-location"></a>The practical part of religion deals with exterior forms and ceremonies, and with
                        modes of punishment for certain offences. This is the material side of the law, and
                        guides the customs and manners of the people.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="542194845" class="brl-location"></a>In the time of Moses, there were ten crimes punishable by death. When Christ came
                        this was changed; the old axiom “an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth” was converted
                        into “Love your enemies, do good to them that hate you,” the stern old law being changed
                        into one of love, mercy and forbearance!
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="370277131" class="brl-location"></a>In the former days the punishment for theft was the cutting off of the right hand;
                        in our time this law could not be so applied. In this age, a man who curses his father
                        is allowed to live, when formerly he would have been put to death. It is therefore
                        evident that whilst the spiritual law never alters, the practical rules must change
                        their application with the necessities of the time. The spiritual aspect of religion
                        is the greater, the more important of the two, and this is the same for all time.
                        It never changes! It is the same, yesterday, today, and  forever! “As it was the beginning,
                        is now, and ever shall be.”
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="352527373" class="brl-location"></a>Now, all questions of morality contained in the spiritual, immutable law of every
                        religion are logically right. If religion were contrary to logical reason then it
                        would cease to be a religion and be merely a tradition. Religion and science are the
                        two wings upon which man’s intelligence can soar into the heights, with which the
                        human soul can progress. It is not possible to fly with one wing alone! Should a man
                        try to fly with the wing of religion alone he would quickly fall into the quagmire
                        of superstition, whilst on the other hand, with the wing of science alone he would
                        also make no progress, but fall into the despairing slough of materialism. All religions
                        of the present day have fallen into superstitious practices, out of harmony alike
                        with the true principles of the teaching they represent and with the scientific discoveries
                        of the time. Many religious leaders have grown to think that the importance of religion
                        lies mainly in the adherence to a collection of certain dogmas and the practice of
                        rites and ceremonies! Those whose souls they profess to cure are taught to believe
                        likewise, and these cling tenaciously to the outward forms, confusing them with the
                        inward truth.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="310217958" class="brl-location"></a>Now, these forms and rituals differ in the various churches and amongst the different
                        sects, and even contradict one another; giving rise to discord, hatred, and disunion.
                        The outcome of all this dissension is the belief of many cultured men that religion
                        and science are contradictory terms, that religion needs no powers  of reflection,
                        and should in no wise be regulated by science, but must of necessity be opposed, the
                        one to the other. The unfortunate effect of this is that science has drifted apart
                        from religion, and religion has become a mere blind and more or less apathetic following
                        of the precepts of certain religious teachers, who insist on their own favorite dogmas
                        being accepted even when they are contrary to science. This is foolishness, for it
                        is quite evident that science is the light, and, being so, religion <span class="brl-italic">truly</span> so-called does not oppose knowledge.

                        <a id="113426875" class="brl-location"></a>We are familiar with the phrases “Light and Darkness,” “Religion and Science.” But
                        the religion which does not walk hand in hand with science is itself in the darkness
                        of superstition and ignorance.

                        <a id="335710686" class="brl-location"></a>Much of the discord and disunion of the world is created by these man-made oppositions
                        and contradictions. If religion were in harmony with science and they walked together,
                        much of the hatred and bitterness now bringing misery to the human race would be at
                        an end.

                        a creature apart. Is it not his reasoning power, his intelligence? Shall he not make
                        use of these in his study of religion? I say unto you: weigh carefully in the balance
                        of reason and science everything that is presented to you as religion. If it passes
                        this test, then accept it, for it is truth! If, however, it does not so conform, then
                        reject it, for it is ignorance!

                        Mighty Maker of all things visible and invisible! Others worship the sun or trees,
                        also stones! In past ages there were those who adored the sea, the clouds, and even
                        clay!

                        that they dispute over this point of ritual or that particular practice, until one
                        hears on all sides of wearisome arguments and unrest. There are individuals who have
                        weak intellects and their powers of reasoning have not developed, but the strength
                        and power of religion must not be doubted because of the incapacity of these persons
                        to understand.

                        the earth revolves round the sun, but, when his intelligence is awakened, the fact
                        is clear and plain to him.

                        is one. When religion, shorn of its superstitions, traditions, and unintelligent dogmas,
                        shows its conformity with science, then will there be a great unifying, cleansing
                        force in the world which will sweep before it all wars, disagreements, discords and
                        struggles—and then will mankind be united in the power of the Love of God.

                        these prejudices have caused the world’s sickness. It is a grave malady which, unless
                        arrested, is capable of causing the destruction of the whole human race. Every ruinous
                        war, with its terrible bloodshed and misery, has been caused by one or other of these
                        prejudices.

                        <a id="159128621" class="brl-location"></a>The deplorable wars going on in these days are caused by the fanatical religious hatred
                        of one people for another, or the prejudices of race or color.

                        <a id="606265053" class="brl-location"></a>Until all these barriers erected by prejudice are swept away, it is not possible for
                        humanity to be at peace. For this reason Bahá’u’lláh has said, “These Prejudices are
                        destructive to mankind.”
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="161946957" class="brl-location"></a>Contemplate first the prejudice of religion: consider the nations of so-called religious
                        people; if they were truly worshippers of God they would obey His law which forbids
                        them to kill one another.

                        <a id="986157516" class="brl-location"></a>If priests of religion really adored the God of love and served the Divine Light,
                        they would teach their people to keep the chief Commandment, “To be in love and charity
                        with all men.” But we find the contrary, for it is often the priests who encourage
                        nations to fight. Religious hatred is ever the most cruel!
                     </p>

                        <a id="180044465" class="brl-location"></a>All religions teach that we should love one another; that we should seek out our own
                        shortcomings before we presume to condemn the faults of others, that we must not consider
                        ourselves superior to our neighbors! We must be careful not to exalt ourselves lest
                        we be humiliated.

                        our thoughts! How many men who have seemed saint-like to their friends have fallen
                        into the greatest humiliation. Think of Judas Iscariot; he began well, but remember
                        his end! On the other hand, Paul, the Apostle, was in his early life an enemy of Christ,
                        whilst later he became His most faithful servant. How then can we flatter ourselves
                        and despise others?

                        <a id="702609333" class="brl-location"></a>Let us therefore be humble, without prejudices,  preferring others’ good to our own!
                        Let us never say, “I am a believer but he is an infidel,” “I am near to God, whilst
                        he is an outcast.” We can never know what will be the final judgment! Therefore let
                        us help all who are in need of any kind of assistance.

                        When we find a person fallen into the depths of misery or sin we must be kind to him,
                        take him by the hand, help him to regain his footing, his strength; we must guide
                        him with love and tenderness, treat him as a friend not as an enemy.

                        <a id="906952907" class="brl-location"></a>Concerning the prejudice of race: it is an illusion, a superstition pure and simple!
                        For God created us all of one race. There were no differences in the beginning, for
                        we are all descendants of Adam. In the beginning, also, there were no limits and boundaries
                        between the different lands; no part of the earth belonged more to one people than
                        to another. In the sight of God there is no difference between the various races.
                        Why should man invent such a prejudice? How can we uphold war caused by an illusion?
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="131303848" class="brl-location"></a>God has not created men that they should destroy one another. All races, tribes, sects
                        and classes share equally in the Bounty of their Heavenly Father.
                     </p>

                        <a id="189265146" class="brl-location"></a>The only difference lies in the degree of faithfulness, of obedience to the laws of
                        God. There are some who are as lighted torches, there are others who shine as stars
                        in the sky of humanity. The lovers of mankind, these are the superior men, of whatever
                        nation, creed, or color they may be. For it is they to whom God will say these blessed
                        words, “Well done, My good and faithful servants.” In that day He will not ask, “Are
                        you English, French, or perhaps Persian? Do you come from the East, or from the West?”
                     </p>

                        <a id="077978781" class="brl-location"></a>The only division that is real is this: There are heavenly men and earthly men; self-sacrificing
                        servants of humanity in the love of the Most High, bringing harmony and unity, teaching
                        peace and goodwill to men. On the other hand there are those selfish men, haters of
                        their brethren, in whose hearts prejudice has replaced loving kindness, and whose
                        influence breeds discord and strife.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="354413762" class="brl-location"></a>To which race or to which color belong these two divisions of men, to the White, to
                        the Yellow, to the Black, to the East or to the West, to the North or to the South?
                        If these are God’s divisions, why should we invent others? Political prejudice is
                        equally mischievous, it is one of the greatest causes of bitter strife amongst the
                        children of men. There are people who find pleasure in breeding discord, who constantly
                        endeavor to goad their country into making war upon other nations—and why? They think
                        to advantage their own country to the detriment of all others. They send armies to
                        harass and destroy the land, in order to become famous in the world, for the joy of
                        conquest. That it may be said: “Such a country has defeated another, and brought it
                        under the yoke of their stronger, more superior rule.” This victory, bought at the
                        price of much bloodshed, is not lasting! The conqueror  shall one day be conquered;
                        and the vanquished ones victorious! Remember the history of the past: did not France
                        conquer Germany more than once—then did not the German nation overcome France?
                     </p>

                        <a id="862165599" class="brl-location"></a>We learn also that France conquered England; then was the English nation victorious
                        over France!
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="278586512" class="brl-location"></a>These glorious conquests are so ephemeral! Why attach so great importance to them
                        and to their fame, as to be willing to shed the blood of the people for their attainment?
                        Is any victory worth the inevitable train of evils consequent upon human slaughter,
                        the grief and sorrow and ruin which must overwhelm so many homes of both nations?
                        For it is not possible that one country alone should suffer.
                     </p>

                        <a id="756448802" class="brl-location"></a>Oh! why will man, the disobedient child of God, who should be an example of the power

                        courses of costly and dainty food; whilst others can scarce find sufficient crusts
                        to keep them alive. Whilst some are clothed in velvets, furs and fine linen, others

                        would be destroyed. The law of order must always obtain in the world of humanity.

                        How could it be possible that wisdom and stupidity should be equal? Humanity, like
                        a great army, requires a general, captains, under-officers in their degree, and soldiers,
                        each with their own appointed duties. Degrees are absolutely necessary to ensure an
                        orderly organization. An army could not be composed of generals alone, or of captains
                        only, or of nothing but soldiers without one in authority. The certain result of such
                        a plan would be that disorder and demoralization would overtake the whole army.

                        <a id="181571401" class="brl-location"></a>King Lycurgus, the philosopher, made a great plan to equalize the subjects of Sparta;
                        with self-sacrifice and wisdom was the experiment begun. Then the king called the
                        people of his kingdom, and made them swear a great oath to maintain the same order
                        of government if he should leave the country, also that nothing should make them alter
                        it until his return. Having secured this oath, he left his kingdom of Sparta and never
                        returned. Lycurgus abandoned the situation, renouncing his high position, thinking
                        to achieve the permanent good of his country by the equalization of the property and
                        of the conditions of life in his kingdom.  All the self-sacrifice of the king was
                        in vain. The great experiment failed. After a time all was destroyed; his carefully
                        thought-out constitution came to an end.

                        <a id="359876513" class="brl-location"></a>The futility of attempting such a scheme was shown and the impossibility of attaining

                        To be seated in the mean<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#180188975">1</a></sup> is most desirable. If it be right for a capitalist to possess a large fortune, it

                        grinding poverty to a very large number of the people. The rich must give of their
                        abundance, they must soften their hearts and cultivate a compassionate intelligence,
                        taking thought for those sad ones who are suffering from lack of the very necessities

                        in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas forty years ago. It is there pointed out that the question of
                        diversity of tongues is a very difficult one. There are more than eight  hundred languages

                        this means of intercourse. Difference of speech is one of the most fruitful causes
                        of dislike and distrust that exists between nations, which are kept apart by their
                        inability to understand each other’s language more than by any other reason.

                        no fear of God before their eyes, who think not of the consequences of their actions,
                        working for their own desires, and these have brought Persia into great trouble and

                        <a id="326422444" class="brl-location"></a>Justice is not limited, it is a universal quality. Its operation must be carried out
                        in all classes, from the highest to the lowest. Justice must be sacred, and the rights
                        of all the people must be considered. Desire for others only that which you desire
                        for yourselves. Then  shall we rejoice in the Sun of Justice, which shines from the

                        <a id="934865468" class="brl-location"></a>In the animal kingdom we see that the male and the female have equal rights; and that

                        <a id="212800344" class="brl-location"></a>Now in the two lower kingdoms of nature we have seen that there is no question of
                        the superiority of one sex over the other. In the world of humanity we find a great
                        difference; the female sex is treated as though inferior, and is not allowed equal
                        rights and privileges. This condition is due not to nature, but to education. In the
                        Divine Creation there is no such distinction. Neither sex is superior to the other
                        in the sight of God. Why then should one sex assert the inferiority of the other,
                        withholding just rights and privileges as though God had given His authority for such
                        a course of action? If women received the same educational advantages as those of
                        men, the result would demonstrate the equality of capacity of both for scholarship.
                     </p>

                        <a id="534413161" class="brl-location"></a>In some respects woman is superior to man. She is more tenderhearted, more receptive,
                        her intuition is more intense.
                     </p>

                        <a id="881715099" class="brl-location"></a>It is not to be denied that in various directions woman at present is more backward
                        than man, also that this temporary inferiority is due to the lack of educational opportunity.
                        In the necessity of life, woman is more  instinct with power than man, for to her
                        he owes his very existence.
                     </p>

                        <a id="323975889" class="brl-location"></a>If the mother is educated then her children will be well taught. When the mother is
                        wise, then will the children be led into the path of wisdom. If the mother be religious
                        she will show her children how they should love God. If the mother is moral she guides
                        her little ones into the ways of uprightness.
                     </p>

                        <a id="659862374" class="brl-location"></a>It is clear therefore that the future generation depends on the mothers of today.
                        Is not this a vital responsibility for the woman? Does she not require every possible
                        advantage to equip her for such a task?
                     </p>

                        <a id="938423305" class="brl-location"></a>Therefore, surely, God is not pleased that so important an instrument as woman should
                        suffer from want of training in order to attain the perfections desirable and necessary
                        for her great life’s work! Divine Justice demands that the rights of both sexes should
                        be equally respected since neither is superior to the other in the eyes of Heaven.
                        Dignity before God depends, not on sex, but on purity and luminosity of heart. Human

                        <a id="693581051" class="brl-location"></a>Woman must endeavor then to attain greater perfection, to be man’s equal in every
                        respect, to make progress in all in which she has been backward, so that man will
                        be compelled to acknowledge her equality of capacity and attainment.

                        <a id="873645729" class="brl-location"></a>In Europe women have made greater progress than in the East, but there is still much
                        to be done! When students have arrived at the end of their school term an examination
                        takes place, and the result thereof determines the knowledge and capacity of each
                        student.  So will it be with woman; her actions will show her power, there will no
                        longer be any need to proclaim it by words.
                     </p>

                        <a id="256754187" class="brl-location"></a>It is my hope that women of the East, as well as their Western sisters, will progress
                        rapidly until humanity shall reach perfection.

                        <a id="693905218" class="brl-location"></a>God’s Bounty is for all and gives power for all progress. When men own the equality
                        of women there will be no need for them to struggle for their rights! One of the principles
                        then of Bahá’u’lláh is the equality of sex.

                        <a id="758283027" class="brl-location"></a>Women must make the greatest effort to acquire spiritual power and to increase in
                        the virtue of wisdom and holiness until their enlightenment and striving succeeds
                        in bringing about the unity of mankind. They must work with a burning enthusiasm to
                        spread the Teaching of Bahá’u’lláh among the peoples, so that the radiant light of
                        the Divine Bounty may envelop the souls of all the nations of the world!

                        is man able to progress, for the power of man is limited and the Divine Power is boundless.”
                        The reading of history  brings us to the conclusion that all truly great men, the
                        benefactors of the human race, those who have moved men to love the right and hate
                        the wrong and who have caused real progress, all these have been inspired by the force
                        of the Holy Spirit.

                        <a id="608508805" class="brl-location"></a>The Prophets of God have not all graduated in the schools of learned philosophy; indeed
                        they were often men of humble birth, to all appearance ignorant, unknown men of no
                        importance in the eyes of the world; sometimes even lacking the knowledge of reading
                        and writing.

                        Teachers of the truth, was the power of the Holy Spirit. Their influence on humanity,
                        by virtue of this mighty inspiration, was great and penetrating.

                        <a id="839074781" class="brl-location"></a>The influence of the wisest philosophers, without this Spirit Divine, has been comparatively
                        unimportant, however extensive their learning and deep their scholarship.

                        <a id="620600013" class="brl-location"></a>The unusual intellects, for instance, of Plato, Aristotle, Pliny and Socrates, have
                        not influenced men so greatly that they have been anxious to sacrifice their lives
                        for their teachings; whilst some of those simple men so moved humanity that thousands
                        of men have become willing martyrs to uphold their words; for these words were inspired
                        by the Divine Spirit of God! The prophets of Judah and Israel, Elijah, Jeremiah, Isaiah
                        and Ezekiel, were humble men, as were also the apostles of Jesus Christ.

                        <a id="990627719" class="brl-location"></a>Peter, the chief of the apostles, used to divide the  proceeds of his fishing into
                        seven parts, and when, having taken one part for each day’s use, he arrived at the
                        seventh portion, he knew it was the Sabbath day. Consider this! and then think of
                        his future position; to what glory he attained because the Holy Spirit wrought great
                        works through him.

                        <a id="310122874" class="brl-location"></a>We understand that the Holy Spirit is the energizing factor in the life of man. Whosoever

                        <a id="412518768" class="brl-location"></a>The greatest philosophers without this Spirit are powerless, their souls lifeless,
                        their hearts dead! Unless the Holy Spirit breathes into their souls, they can do no
                        good work. No system of philosophy has ever been able to change the manners and customs
                        of a people for the better. Learned philosophers, unenlightened by the Divine Spirit,
                        have often been men of inferior morality; they have not proclaimed in their actions
                        the reality of their beautiful phrases.

                        the most nobly-born profound scholar without that inspiration. He who is educated

                        your own finite selves and fix your eyes upon the Everlasting Radiance; then will
                        your souls receive in full measure the Divine Power of the Spirit and the Blessings

                        <span class="brl-uppercase">When</span> I arrived in Paris some time ago for the first time, I looked around me with much
                        interest, and in my mind I likened this beautiful city to a large garden.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="515674628" class="brl-location"></a>With loving care and much thought I examined the soil, and found it to be very good
                        and full of possibility for steadfast faith and firm belief, for a seed of God’s love
                        has been cast into the ground.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="597618229" class="brl-location"></a>Clouds of Heavenly Mercy showered their rain upon it, and the Sun of Truth fell warmly
                        upon the young seeds, and today one can see in your midst the birth  of belief. The
                        seed cast into the ground has begun to spring up, and day by day you will see it grow.
                        The bounties of the Kingdom of Bahá’u’lláh shall indeed bring forth a wondrous harvest!
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="266745203" class="brl-location"></a>Behold! I bring you glad and joyful tidings! Paris will become a garden of roses!
                        All kinds of beautiful flowers will spring up and flourish in this garden, and the
                        fame of their fragrance and beauty will be spread in all lands. When I think of Paris
                        in the future, I seem to see her bathed in the light of the Holy Spirit! Verily, the
                        day is dawning when Paris will receive her illumination, and the Goodness and Mercy
                        of God will be visible to every living creature.
                     </p>

                        <a id="469193559" class="brl-location"></a>Do not allow your minds to dwell on the present, but with eyes of faith look into
                        the future, for in truth the Spirit of God is working in your midst.

                        <a id="801167783" class="brl-location"></a>Since my arrival a few weeks ago, I can see the growth of spirituality. At the beginning
                        only a few souls came to me for Light, but during my short sojourn among you the numbers
                        have increased and doubled. This is a promise for the future!
                     </p>

                        <a id="851689448" class="brl-location"></a>When Christ was crucified and left this world, He had only eleven disciples and a
                        very few followers; but as He served the Cause of truth, look today at the result
                        of His life’s work! He has illumined the world, and given life to dead humanity. After
                        His ascension little by little His Cause grew, the souls of His followers became more
                        and more luminous, and the exquisite perfume of their saintly lives spread on all
                        sides.
                     </p>

                        <a id="726122041" class="brl-location"></a>Now today, thank God, a similar condition has begun in Paris. There are many souls
                        who have turned to  the Kingdom of God, and who are attracted to unity, love and truth.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="981363647" class="brl-location"></a>Try so to work that the goodness and mercy of the Most Glorious may enfold the whole
                        of Paris. The Breath of the Holy Spirit will help you, the Celestial Light of the
                        Kingdom will shine in your hearts, and the blessed angels of God from Heaven will
                        bring you strength and will succor you. Then thank God with all your hearts that you
                        have attained to this supreme benefit. A great part of the world is plunged in sleep,
                        but you have been awakened. Many are blind, but you see!
                     </p>

                        <a id="893376525" class="brl-location"></a>The call of the Kingdom is heard in your midst. Glory be to God, you have been born
                        again, you have been baptized by the fire of the Love of God; you have been plunged
                        in the Sea of Life and regenerated by the Spirit of Love!
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="552957551" class="brl-location"></a>Having received such favor be thankful unto God, and never doubt His Goodness and
                        Loving Kindness but have undying faith in the Bounties of the Kingdom. Consort together
                        in brotherly love, be ready to lay down your lives one for the other, and not only
                        for those who are dear to you, but for all humanity. Look upon the whole human race
                        as members of one family, all children of God; and, in so doing, you will see no difference
                        between them.

                        Think of all men as being flowers, leaves or buds of this tree, and try to help each
                        and all to realize and enjoy God’s blessings. God neglects none: He loves all.

                        <a id="568565770" class="brl-location"></a>The only real difference that exists between people  is that they are at various stages
                        of development. Some are imperfect—these must be brought to perfection. Some are asleep—they
                        must be awakened; some are negligent—they must be roused; but one and all are the
                        children of God. Love them all with your whole heart; no one is a stranger to the
                        other, all are friends. Tonight I come to say farewell to you—but bear this in your
                        minds, that although our bodies may be far apart, in spirit we shall always be together.

                        <a id="087732025" class="brl-location"></a>I bear you one and all in my heart, and will forget none of you—and I hope that none
                        of you will forget me.

                        <a id="847604358" class="brl-location"></a>I in the East, and you in the West, let us try with heart and soul that unity may
                        dwell in the world, that all the peoples may become one people, and that the whole
                        surface of the earth may be like one country—for the Sun of Truth shines on all alike.

                        <a id="786857796" class="brl-location"></a>Look how Abraham strove to bring faith and love among the people; how Moses tried
                        to unite the people by sound laws; how the Lord Christ suffered unto death to bring
                        the light of love and truth into a darkened world; how Muḥammad sought to bring unity
                        and peace between the various uncivilized tribes among whom He dwelt. And last of
                        all, Bahá’u’lláh has suffered forty years for the same cause—the single noble purpose
                        of spreading love among the children of men—and for the peace and unity of the world
                        the Báb gave up His life.

                        <a id="724564554" class="brl-location"></a>Thus, strive to follow the example of these Divine  Beings, drink from Their fountain,
                        be illumined by Their Light, and to the world be as symbols of the Mercy and Love
                        of God. Be unto the world as rain and clouds of mercy, as suns of truth; be a celestial
                        army, and you shall indeed conquer the city of hearts.
                     </p>

                        <a id="829440302" class="brl-location"></a>Be thankful unto God that Bahá’u’lláh has given us a firm and solid foundation. He
                        left no place for sadness in hearts, and the writings of His sacred pen contain consolation
                        for the whole world. He had the words of truth, and anything that is contrary to His
                        teaching is false. The chief aim of all His work was to do away with division.
                     </p>

                        <a id="171936205" class="brl-location"></a>The testament of Bahá’u’lláh is a Rain of Goodness, a Sun of Truth, Water of Life,
                        the Holy Spirit. Thus open your hearts to receive the full power of His Beauty, and
                        I will pray for you all that this joy may be yours.

                        <a id="298683615" class="brl-location"></a>Now I say “Good-bye.”

                        <a id="570769129" class="brl-location"></a>This I say only to your outer selves; I do not say it to your souls, for our souls

                        <span class="brl-uppercase">About</span> one thousand years ago a society was formed in Persia called the Society of the Friends,
                        who gathered together for silent communion with the Almighty.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="919148162" class="brl-location"></a>They divided Divine philosophy into two parts: one kind is that of which the knowledge
                        can be acquired through lectures and study in schools and colleges. The second kind
                        of philosophy was that of the Illuminati, or followers of the inner light. The schools
                        of this philosophy were held in silence. Meditating, and turning their faces to the
                        Source of Light, from that central Light the mysteries of the Kingdom were reflected
                        in the hearts of these people. All the Divine problems were solved by this power of
                        illumination.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="567877208" class="brl-location"></a>This Society of Friends increased greatly in Persia, and up to the present time their
                        societies exist. Many books and epistles were written by their leaders. When they
                        assemble in their meeting-house they sit silently and contemplate; their leader opens
                        with a certain proposition, and says to the assembly “You must meditate on this problem.”
                        Then, freeing their minds from everything else, they sit and reflect, and before long
                        the answer is revealed to them. Many abstruse divine questions are solved by this
                        illumination. 
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="838455018" class="brl-location"></a>Some of the great questions unfolding from the rays of the Sun of Reality upon the
                        mind of man are: the problem of the reality of the spirit of man; of the birth of
                        the spirit; of its birth from this world into the world of God; the question of the
                        inner life of the spirit and of its fate after its ascension from the body.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="400402370" class="brl-location"></a>They also meditate upon the scientific questions of the day, and these are likewise
                        solved.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="398256597" class="brl-location"></a>These people, who are called “Followers of the inner light,” attain to a superlative
                        degree of power, and are entirely freed from blind dogmas and imitations. Men rely
                        on the statements of these people: by themselves—within themselves—they solve all
                        mysteries.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="964071274" class="brl-location"></a>If they find a solution with the assistance of the inner light, they accept it, and
                        afterwards they declare it: otherwise they would consider it a matter of blind imitation.
                        They go so far as to reflect upon the essential nature of the Divinity, of the Divine
                        revelation, of the manifestation of the Deity in this world. All the divine and scientific
                        questions are solved by them through the power of the spirit.

                        <a id="359367592" class="brl-location"></a>Bahá’u’lláh says there is a sign (from God) in every phenomenon: the sign of the intellect
                        is contemplation and the sign of contemplation is silence, because it is impossible
                        for a man to do two things at one time—he cannot both speak and meditate.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="896911561" class="brl-location"></a>It is an axiomatic fact that while you meditate you are speaking with your own spirit.
                        In that state of mind you put certain questions to your spirit and the spirit answers:
                        the light breaks forth and the reality is revealed. 
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="805346944" class="brl-location"></a>You cannot apply the name “man” to any being void of this faculty of meditation; without
                        it he would be a mere animal, lower than the beasts.
                     </p>

                        <a id="045586672" class="brl-location"></a>Through the faculty of meditation man attains to eternal life; through it he receives
                        the breath of the Holy Spirit—the bestowal of the Spirit is given in reflection and
                        meditation.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="742753817" class="brl-location"></a>The spirit of man is itself informed and strengthened during meditation; through it
                        affairs of which man knew nothing are unfolded before his view. Through it he receives
                        Divine inspiration, through it he receives heavenly food.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="176156972" class="brl-location"></a>Meditation is the key for opening the doors of mysteries. In that state man abstracts
                        himself: in that state man withdraws himself from all outside objects; in that subjective
                        mood he is immersed in the ocean of spiritual life and can unfold the secrets of things-in-themselves.
                        To illustrate this, think of man as endowed with two kinds of sight; when the power
                        of insight is being used the outward power of vision does not see.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="644302218" class="brl-location"></a>This faculty of meditation frees man from the animal nature, discerns the reality
                        of things, puts man in touch with God.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="346977748" class="brl-location"></a>This faculty brings forth from the invisible plane the sciences and arts. Through
                        the meditative faculty inventions are made possible, colossal undertakings are carried
                        out; through it governments can run smoothly. Through this faculty man enters into
                        the very Kingdom of God.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="231017994" class="brl-location"></a>Nevertheless some thoughts are useless to man; they are like waves moving in the sea
                        without result. But  if the faculty of meditation is bathed in the inner light and
                        characterized with divine attributes, the results will be confirmed.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="961957264" class="brl-location"></a>The meditative faculty is akin to the mirror; if you put it before earthly objects
                        it will reflect them. Therefore if the spirit of man is contemplating earthly subjects
                        he will be informed of these.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="234047324" class="brl-location"></a>But if you turn the mirror of your spirits heavenwards, the heavenly constellations
                        and the rays of the Sun of Reality will be reflected in your hearts, and the virtues
                        of the Kingdom will be obtained.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="547795502" class="brl-location"></a>Therefore let us keep this faculty rightly directed—turning it to the heavenly Sun
                        and not to earthly objects—so that we may discover the secrets of the Kingdom, and
                        comprehend the allegories of the Bible and the mysteries of the spirit.

                        Books have been written, so that man may be made free. Just as he is born into this

                        <a id="337559080" class="brl-location"></a>Love gives life to the lifeless. Love lights a flame in the heart that is cold. Love
                        brings hope to the hopeless and gladdens the hearts of the sorrowful.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="894391376" class="brl-location"></a>In the world of existence there is indeed no greater power than the power of love.
                        When the heart of man is aglow with the flame of love, he is ready to sacrifice  all—even
                        his life. In the Gospel it is said God is love.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="505039427" class="brl-location"></a>There are four kinds of love. The first is the love that flows from God to man; it
                        consists of the inexhaustible graces, the Divine effulgence and heavenly illumination.
                        Through this love the world of being receives life. Through this love man is endowed
                        with physical existence, until, through the breath of the Holy Spirit—this same love—he
                        receives eternal life and becomes the image of the Living God. This love is the origin
                        of all the love in the world of creation.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="496891770" class="brl-location"></a>The second is the love that flows from man to God. This is faith, attraction to the
                        Divine, enkindlement, progress, entrance into the Kingdom of God, receiving the Bounties
                        of God, illumination with the lights of the Kingdom. This love is the origin of all
                        philanthropy; this love causes the hearts of men to reflect the rays of the Sun of
                        Reality.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="260652165" class="brl-location"></a>The third is the love of God towards the Self or Identity of God. This is the transfiguration
                        of His Beauty, the reflection of Himself in the mirror of His Creation. This is the
                        reality of love, the Ancient Love, the Eternal Love. Through one ray of this Love
                        all other love exists.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="954457891" class="brl-location"></a>The fourth is the love of man for man. The love which exists between the hearts of
                        believers is prompted by the ideal of the unity of spirits. This love is attained
                        through the knowledge of God, so that men see the Divine Love reflected in the heart.
                        Each sees in the other the Beauty of God reflected in the soul, and finding this point
                        of similarity, they are attracted to one another in love. This love will make all
                        men the  waves of one sea, this love will make them all the stars of one heaven and
                        the fruits of one tree. This love will bring the realization of true accord, the foundation
                        of real unity.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="774283138" class="brl-location"></a>But the love which sometimes exists between friends is not (true) love, because it
                        is subject to transmutation; this is merely fascination. As the breeze blows, the
                        slender trees yield. If the wind is in the East the tree leans to the West, and if
                        the wind turns to the West the tree leans to the East. This kind of love is originated
                        by the accidental conditions of life. This is not love, it is merely acquaintanceship;
                        it is subject to change.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="968357691" class="brl-location"></a>Today you will see two souls apparently in close friendship; tomorrow all this may
                        be changed. Yesterday they were ready to die for one another, today they shun one
                        another’s society! This is not love; it is the yielding of the hearts to the accidents
                        of life. When that which has caused this “love” to exist passes, the love passes also;
                        this is not in reality love.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="497975270" class="brl-location"></a>Love is only of the four kinds that I have explained. (a) The love of God towards
                        the identity of God. Christ has said God is Love. (b) The love of God for His children—for
                        His servants. (c) The love of man for God and (d) the love of man for man. These four
                        kinds of love originate from God. These are rays from the Sun of Reality; these are
                        the Breathings of the Holy Spirit; these are the Signs of the Reality.

                     <p>
                        <a id="966841693" class="brl-location"></a>In this Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh, the women go neck and neck with the men. In no
                        movement will they be left behind. Their rights with men are equal in degree. They
                        will enter all the administrative branches of politics. They will attain in all such
                        a degree as will be considered the very highest station of the world of humanity and
                        will take part in all affairs. Rest ye assured. Do ye not look upon the present conditions;
                        in the not far distant future the world of women will become all-refulgent and all-glorious,
                        <span class="brl-italic">For His Holiness Bahá’u’lláh Hath Willed It so!</span> At the time of elections the right to vote is the inalienable right of women, and
                        the entrance of women into all human departments  is an irrefutable and incontrovertible
                        question. No soul can retard or prevent it.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="751128598" class="brl-location"></a>But there are certain matters, the participation in which is not worthy of women.
                        For example, at the time when the community is taking up vigorous defensive measures
                        against the attack of foes, the women are exempt from military engagements. It may
                        so happen that at a given time warlike and savage tribes may furiously attack the
                        body politic with the intention of carrying on a wholesale slaughter of its members;
                        under such a circumstance defense is necessary, but it is the duty of men to organize
                        and execute such defensive measures and not the women—because their hearts are tender
                        and they cannot endure the sight of the horror of carnage, even if it is for the sake
                        of defense. From such and similar undertakings the women are exempt.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="593125787" class="brl-location"></a>As regards the constitution of the House of Justice, Bahá’u’lláh addresses the men.
                        He says: “O ye men of the House of Justice!”
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="142087358" class="brl-location"></a>But when its members are to be elected, the right which belongs to women, so far as
                        their voting and their voice is concerned, is indisputable. When the women attain
                        to the ultimate degree of progress, then, according to the exigency of the time and
                        place and their great capacity, they shall obtain extraordinary privileges. Be ye
                        confident on these accounts. His Holiness Bahá’u’lláh has greatly strengthened the
                        cause of women, and the rights and privileges of women is one of the greatest principles
                        of ‘Abdu’l‑Bahá. Rest ye assured! Erelong the days shall come  when the men addressing
                        the women, shall say: <span class="brl-italic">“Blessed are ye! Blessed are ye! Verily ye are worthy of every gift. Verily ye deserve
                           to adorn your heads with the crown of everlasting glory, because in sciences and arts,
                           in virtues and perfections ye shall become equal to man, and as regards tenderness
                           of heart and the abundance of mercy and sympathy ye are superior.”</span>
