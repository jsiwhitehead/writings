                     <a id="392897800" class="brl-location"></a>To an extent unimaginable a decade ago, the ideal of world peace is taking on form
                     and substance. Obstacles that long seemed immovable have collapsed in humanity’s path;
                     apparently irreconcilable conflicts have begun to surrender to processes of consultation
                     and resolution; a willingness to counter military aggression through unified international
                     action is emerging. The effect has been to awaken in both the masses of humanity and
                     many world leaders a degree of hopefulness about the future of our planet that had
                     been nearly extinguished.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <a id="314934856" class="brl-location"></a>Throughout the world, immense intellectual and spiritual energies are seeking expression,
                     energies whose gathering pressure is in direct proportion to the frustrations of recent
                     decades. Everywhere the signs multiply that the earth’s peoples yearn for an end to
                     conflict and to the suffering and ruin from which no land is any longer immune. These
                     rising impulses for change must be seized upon and channeled into overcoming the remaining
                     barriers that block realization of the age-old dream of global peace. The effort of
                     will required for such a task cannot be summoned up merely by appeals for action against
                     the countless ills afflicting society. It must be galvanized by a vision of human
                     prosperity in the fullest sense of the term—an awakening to the possibilities of the
                     spiritual and material well-being now brought within grasp. Its beneficiaries must
                     be all of the planet’s inhabitants, without distinction, without the imposition of
                     conditions unrelated to the fundamental goals of such a reorganization of human affairs.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <a id="298039078" class="brl-location"></a>History has thus far recorded principally the experience of tribes, cultures, classes,
                     and nations. With the physical unification of the planet in this century and acknowledgement
                     of the interdependence of all who live on it, the history of humanity as one people
                     is now beginning. The long, slow civilizing of human character has been a sporadic
                     development, uneven and admittedly inequitable in the material advantages it has conferred.
                     Nevertheless, endowed with the wealth of all the genetic and cultural diversity that
                     has evolved through past ages, the earth’s inhabitants are now challenged to draw
                     on their collective inheritance to take up, consciously and systematically, the responsibility
                     for the design of their future.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <a id="465787862" class="brl-location"></a>It is unrealistic to imagine that the vision of the next stage in the advancement
                     of civilization can be formulated without a searching reexamination of the attitudes
                     and assumptions that currently underlie approaches to social and economic development.
                     At the most obvious level, such rethinking will have to address practical matters
                     of policy, resource utilization, planning procedures, implementation methodologies,
                     and organization. As it proceeds, however, fundamental issues will quickly emerge,
                     related to the long-term goals to be pursued, the social structures required, the
                     implications for development of principles of social justice, and the nature and role
                     of knowledge in effecting enduring change. Indeed, such a reexamination will be driven
                     to seek a broad consensus of understanding about human nature itself. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <a id="644700596" class="brl-location"></a>Two avenues of discussion open directly onto all of these issues, whether conceptual
                     or practical, and it is along these two avenues that we wish to explore, in the pages
                     that follow, the subject of a strategy of global development. The first is prevailing
                     beliefs about the nature and purpose of the development process; the second is the
                     roles assigned in it to the various protagonists.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <a id="846541685" class="brl-location"></a>The assumptions directing most of current development planning are essentially materialistic.
                     That is to say, the purpose of development is defined in terms of the successful cultivation
                     in all societies of those means for the achievement of material prosperity that have,
                     through trial and error, already come to characterize certain regions of the world.
                     Modifications in development discourse do indeed occur, accommodating differences
                     of culture and political system and responding to the alarming dangers posed by environmental
                     degradation. Yet the underlying materialistic assumptions remain essentially unchallenged.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <a id="728961735" class="brl-location"></a>As the twentieth century draws to a close, it is no longer possible to maintain the
                     belief that the approach to social and economic development to which the materialistic
                     conception of life has given rise is capable of meeting humanity’s needs. Optimistic
                     forecasts about the changes it would generate have vanished into the ever-widening
                     abyss that separates the living standards of a small and relatively diminishing minority
                     of the world’s inhabitants from the poverty experienced by the vast majority of the
                     globe’s population.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <a id="766477708" class="brl-location"></a>This unprecedented economic crisis, together with the social breakdown it has helped
                     to engender, reflects a profound error of conception about human nature itself. For
                     the levels of response elicited from human beings by the incentives of the prevailing
                     order are not only inadequate, but seem almost irrelevant in the face of world events.
                     We are being shown that, unless the development of society finds a purpose beyond
                     the mere amelioration of material conditions, it will fail of attaining even these
                     goals. That purpose must be sought in spiritual dimensions of life and motivation
                     that transcend a constantly changing economic landscape and an artificially imposed
                     division of human societies into “developed” and “developing”.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <a id="037534807" class="brl-location"></a>As the purpose of development is being redefined, it will become necessary also to
                     look again at assumptions about the appropriate roles to be played by the protagonists
                     in the process. The crucial role of government, at whatever level, requires no elaboration.
                     Future generations, however, will find almost incomprehensible the circumstance that,
                     in an age paying tribute to an egalitarian philosophy and related democratic principles,
                     development planning should view the masses of humanity as essentially recipients
                     of benefits from aid and training. Despite acknowledgement of participation as a principle,
                     the scope of the decision making left to most of the world’s population is at best
                     secondary, limited to a range of choices formulated by agencies inaccessible to them
                     and determined by goals that are often irreconcilable with their perceptions of reality.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <a id="618093050" class="brl-location"></a>This approach is even endorsed, implicitly if not explicitly, by established religion.
                     Burdened by traditions of paternalism, prevailing religious thought seems incapable
                     of translating an expressed faith in the spiritual dimensions of human nature into
                     confidence in humanity’s collective capacity to transcend material conditions. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <a id="009679498" class="brl-location"></a>Such an attitude misses the significance of what is likely the most important social
                     phenomenon of our time. If it is true that the governments of the world are striving
                     through the medium of the United Nations system to construct a new global order, it
                     is equally true that the peoples of the world are galvanized by this same vision.
                     Their response has taken the form of a sudden efflorescence of countless movements
                     and organizations of social change at local, regional, and international levels. Human
                     rights, the advance of women, the social requirements of sustainable economic development,
                     the overcoming of prejudices, the moral education of children, literacy, primary health
                     care, and a host of other vital concerns each commands the urgent advocacy of organizations
                     supported by growing numbers in every part of the globe.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <a id="475346529" class="brl-location"></a>This response of the world’s people themselves to the crying needs of the age echoes
                     the call that Bahá’u’lláh raised over a hundred years ago: “Be anxiously concerned
                     with the needs of the age ye live in, and center your deliberations on its exigencies
                     and requirements.” The transformation in the way that great numbers of ordinary people
                     are coming to see themselves—a change that is dramatically abrupt in the perspective
                     of the history of civilization—raises fundamental questions about the role assigned
                     to the general body of humanity in the planning of our planet’s future.

                     <a id="018930835" class="brl-location"></a>The bedrock of a strategy that can engage the world’s population in assuming responsibility
                     for its collective destiny must be the consciousness of the oneness of humankind.
                     Deceptively simple in popular discourse, the concept that humanity constitutes a single
                     people presents fundamental challenges to the way that most of the institutions of
                     contemporary society carry out their functions. Whether in the form of the adversarial
                     structure of civil government, the advocacy principle informing most of civil law,
                     a glorification of the struggle between classes and other social groups, or the competitive
                     spirit dominating so much of modern life, conflict is accepted as the mainspring of
                     human interaction. It represents yet another expression in social organization of
                     the materialistic interpretation of life that has progressively consolidated itself
                     over the past two centuries.

                     <a id="047910823" class="brl-location"></a>In a letter addressed to Queen Victoria over a century ago, and employing an analogy
                     that points to the one model holding convincing promise for the organization of a
                     planetary society, Bahá’u’lláh compared the world to the human body. There is, indeed,
                     no other model in phenomenal existence to which we can reasonably look. Human society
                     is composed not of a mass of merely differentiated cells but of associations of individuals,
                     each one of whom is endowed with intelligence and will; nevertheless, the modes of
                     operation that characterize man’s biological nature illustrate fundamental principles
                     of existence. Chief among these is that of unity in diversity. Paradoxically, it is
                     precisely the wholeness and complexity of the order constituting the human body—and
                     the perfect integration into it of the body’s cells—that permit the full realization
                     of the distinctive capacities inherent in each of these component elements. No cell
                     lives apart from the body, whether in contributing to its functioning or in deriving
                     its share from the well-being of the whole. The physical well-being thus achieved
                     finds its purpose in making possible the expression of human consciousness; that is
                     to say, the purpose of biological development transcends the mere existence of the
                     body and its parts.

                     <a id="406673721" class="brl-location"></a>What is true of the life of the individual has its parallels in human society. The
                     human species is an organic whole, the leading edge of the evolutionary process. That
                     human consciousness necessarily operates through an infinite diversity of individual
                     minds and motivations detracts in no way from its essential unity. Indeed, it is precisely
                     an inhering diversity that distinguishes unity from homogeneity or uniformity. What
                     the peoples of the world are today experiencing, Bahá’u’lláh said, is their collective
                     coming- of-age, and it is through this emerging maturity of the race that the principle
                     of unity in diversity will find full expression. From its earliest beginnings in the
                     consolidation of family life, the process of social organization has successively
                     moved from the simple structures of clan and tribe, through multitudinous forms of
                     urban society, to the eventual emergence of the nation-state, each stage opening up
                     a wealth of new opportunities for the exercise of human capacity.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <a id="181834053" class="brl-location"></a>Clearly, the advancement of the race has not occurred at the expense of human individuality.
                     As social organization has increased, the scope for the expression of the capacities
                     latent in each human being has correspondingly expanded. Because the relationship
                     between the individual and society is a reciprocal one, the transformation now required
                     must occur simultaneously within human consciousness and the structure of social institutions.
                     It is in the opportunities afforded by this twofold process of change that a strategy
                     of global development will find its purpose. At this crucial stage of history, that
                     purpose must be to establish enduring foundations on which planetary civilization
                     can gradually take shape.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <a id="683714729" class="brl-location"></a>Laying the groundwork for global civilization calls for the creation of laws and institutions
                     that are universal in both character and authority. The effort can begin only when
                     the concept of the oneness of humanity has been wholeheartedly embraced by those in
                     whose hands the responsibility for decision making rests, and when the related principles
                     are propagated through both educational systems and the media of mass communication.
                     Once this threshold is crossed, a process will have been set in motion through which
                     the peoples of the world can be drawn into the task of formulating common goals and
                     committing themselves to their attainment. Only so fundamental a reorientation can
                     protect them, too, from the age-old demons of ethnic and religious strife. Only through
                     the dawning consciousness that they constitute a single people will the inhabitants
                     of the planet be enabled to turn away from the patterns of conflict that have dominated
                     social organization in the past and begin to learn the ways of collaboration and conciliation.
                     “The well-being of mankind,” Bahá’u’lláh writes, “its peace and security, are unattainable
                     unless and until its unity is firmly established.”

                     life can be confidently erected. An age that sees the people of the world increasingly
                     gaining access to information of every kind and to a diversity of ideas will find
                     justice asserting itself as the ruling principle of successful social organization.
                     With ever greater frequency, proposals aiming at the development of the planet will
                     have to submit to the candid light of the standards it requires.

                     <a id="369717846" class="brl-location"></a>At the individual level, justice is that faculty of the human soul that enables each
                     person to distinguish truth from falsehood. In the sight of God, Bahá’u’lláh avers,
                     justice is “the best beloved of all things” since it permits each individual to see
                     with his own eyes rather than the eyes of others, to know through his own knowledge
                     rather than the knowledge of his neighbor or his group. It calls for fair-mindedness
                     in one’s judgments, for equity in one’s treatment of others, and is thus a constant
                     if demanding companion in the daily occasions of life.

                     <a id="011818634" class="brl-location"></a>At the group level, a concern for justice is the indispensable compass in collective
                     decision making, because it is the only means by which unity of thought and action
                     can be achieved. Far from encouraging the punitive spirit that has often masqueraded
                     under its name in past ages, justice is the practical expression of awareness that,
                     in the achievement of human progress, the interests of the individual and those of
                     society are inextricably linked. To the extent that justice becomes a guiding concern
                     of human interaction, a consultative climate is encouraged that permits options to
                     be examined dispassionately and appropriate courses of action selected. In such a
                     climate the perennial tendencies toward manipulation and partisanship are far less
                     likely to deflect the decision-making process.
                  </p>

                     <a id="162991470" class="brl-location"></a>The implications for social and economic development are profound. Concern for justice
                     protects the task of defining progress from the temptation to sacrifice the well-being
                     of the generality of humankind—and even of the planet itself—to the advantages which
                     technological breakthroughs can make available to privileged minorities. In design
                     and planning, it ensures that limited resources are not diverted to the pursuit of
                     projects extraneous to a community’s essential social or economic priorities. Above
                     all, only development programs that are perceived as meeting their needs and as being
                     just and equitable in objective can hope to engage the commitment of the masses of
                     humanity, upon whom implementation depends. The relevant human qualities such as honesty,
                     a willingness to work, and a spirit of cooperation are successfully harnessed to the
                     accomplishment of enormously demanding collective goals when every member of society—indeed
                     every component group within society—can trust that they are protected by standards
                     and assured of benefits that apply equally to all.

                     <a id="467881578" class="brl-location"></a>At the heart of the discussion of a strategy of social and economic development, therefore,
                     lies the issue of human rights. The shaping of such a strategy calls for the promotion
                     of human rights to be freed from the grip of the false dichotomies that have for so
                     long held it hostage. Concern that each human being should enjoy the freedom of thought
                     and action conducive to his or her personal growth does not justify devotion to the
                     cult of individualism that so deeply corrupts many areas of contemporary life. Nor
                     does concern to ensure the welfare of society as a whole require a deification of
                     the state as the supposed source of humanity’s well-being. Far otherwise: the history
                     of the present century shows all too clearly that such ideologies and the partisan
                     agendas to which they give rise have been themselves the principal enemies of the
                     interests they purport to serve. Only in a consultative framework made possible by
                     the consciousness of the organic unity of humankind can all aspects of the concern
                     for human rights find legitimate and creative expression.

                     <a id="801982146" class="brl-location"></a>Today, the agency on whom has devolved the task of creating this framework and of
                     liberating the promotion of human rights from those who would exploit it is the system
                     of international institutions born out of the tragedies of two ruinous world wars
                     and the experience of worldwide economic breakdown. Significantly, the term “human
                     rights” has come into general use only since the promulgation of the United Nations
                     Charter in 1945 and the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights three
                     years later. In these history-making documents, formal recognition has been given
                     to respect for social justice as a correlative of the establishment of world peace.
                     The fact that the Declaration passed without a dissenting vote in the General Assembly
                     conferred on it from the outset an authority that has grown steadily in the intervening
                     years.

                     <a id="294052580" class="brl-location"></a>The activity most intimately linked to the consciousness that distinguishes human
                     nature is the individual’s exploration of reality for himself or herself. The freedom
                     to investigate the purpose of existence and to develop the endowments of human nature
                     that make it achievable requires protection. Human beings must be free to know. That
                     such freedom is often abused and such abuse grossly encouraged by features of contemporary
                     society does not detract in any degree from the validity of the impulse itself.
                  </p>

                     <a id="647174262" class="brl-location"></a>It is this distinguishing impulse of human consciousness that provides the moral imperative
                     for the enunciation of many of the rights enshrined in the Universal Declaration and
                     the related Covenants. Universal education, freedom of movement, access to information,
                     and the opportunity to participate in political life are all aspects of its operation
                     that require explicit guarantee by the international community. The same is true of
                     freedom of thought and belief, including religious liberty, along with the right to
                     hold opinions and express these opinions appropriately.

                  <p>
                     <a id="616572370" class="brl-location"></a>Since the body of humankind is one and indivisible, each member of the race is born
                     into the world as a trust of the whole. This trusteeship constitutes the moral foundation
                     of most of the other rights—principally economic and social—which the instruments
                     of the United Nations are attempting similarly to define. The security of the family
                     and the home, the ownership of property, and the right to privacy are all implied
                     in such a trusteeship. The obligations on the part of the community extend to the
                     provision of employment, mental and physical health care, social security, fair wages,
                     rest and recreation, and a host of other reasonable expectations on the part of the
                     individual members of society.

                  <p>
                     <a id="032533119" class="brl-location"></a>The principle of collective trusteeship creates also the right of every person to
                     expect that those cultural conditions essential to his or her identity enjoy the protection
                     of national and international law. Much like the role played by the gene pool in the
                     biological life of humankind and its environment, the immense wealth of cultural diversity
                     achieved over thousands of years is vital to the social and economic development of
                     a human race experiencing its collective coming-of-age. It represents a heritage that
                     must be permitted to bear its fruit in a global civilization. On the one hand, cultural
                     expressions need to be protected from suffocation by the materialistic influences
                     currently holding sway. On the other, cultures must be enabled to interact with one
                     another in ever-changing patterns of civilization, free of manipulation for partisan
                     political ends.

                     among men. The ocean of divine wisdom surgeth within this exalted word, while the

                     community of nations to be promoted and established as prevailing international norms,
                     a fundamental redefinition of human relationships is called for. Present-day conceptions
                     of what is natural and appropriate in relationships—among human beings themselves,
                     between human beings and nature, between the individual and society, and between the
                     members of society and its institutions—reflect levels of understanding arrived at
                     by the human race during earlier and less mature stages in its development. If humanity
                     is indeed coming of age, if all the inhabitants of the planet constitute a single
                     people, if justice is to be the ruling principle of social organization—then existing
                     conceptions that were born out of ignorance of these emerging realities have to be
                     recast.

                     <a id="587882190" class="brl-location"></a>Movement in this direction has barely begun. It will lead, as it unfolds, to a new
                     understanding of the nature of the family and of the rights and responsibilities of
                     each of its members. It will entirely transform the role of women at every level of
                     society. Its effect in reordering people’s relation to the work they do and their
                     understanding of the place of economic activity in their lives will be sweeping. It
                     will bring about far-reaching changes in the governance of human affairs and in the
                     institutions created to carry it out. Through its influence, the work of society’s
                     rapidly proliferating nongovernmental organizations will be increasingly rationalized.
                     It will ensure the creation of binding legislation that will protect both the environment
                     and the development needs of all peoples. Ultimately, the restructuring or transformation
                     of the United Nations system that this movement is already bringing about will no
                     doubt lead to the establishment of a world federation of nations with its own legislative,
                     judicial, and executive bodies.

                     process that Bahá’u’lláh refers to as consultation. “In all things it is necessary
                     to consult,” is His advice. “The maturity of the gift of understanding is made manifest
                     through consultation.”

                     It cannot be achieved—indeed, its attainment is severely handicapped—by the culture
                     of protest that is another widely prevailing feature of contemporary society. Debate,
                     propaganda, the adversarial method, the entire apparatus of partisanship that have

                     as members of a body with its own interests and goals. In such an atmosphere, characterized
                     by both candor and courtesy, ideas belong not to the individual to whom they occur
                     during the discussion but to the group as a whole, to take up, discard, or revise
                     as seems to best serve the goal pursued. Consultation succeeds to the extent that
                     all participants support the decisions arrived at, regardless of the individual opinions
                     with which they entered the discussion. Under such circumstances an earlier decision
                     can be readily reconsidered if experience exposes any shortcomings.

                     <a id="156777934" class="brl-location"></a>Viewed in such a light, consultation is the operating expression of justice in human
                     affairs. So vital is it to the success of collective endeavor that it must constitute
                     a basic feature of a viable strategy of social and economic development. Indeed, the
                     participation of the people on whose commitment and efforts the success of such a
                     strategy depends becomes effective only as consultation is made the organizing principle
                     of every project. “No man can attain his true station”, is Bahá’u’lláh’s counsel,
                     “except through his justice. No power can exist except through unity. No welfare and
                     no well-being can be attained except through consultation.”

                     <a id="997162694" class="brl-location"></a>The tasks entailed in the development of a global society call for levels of capacity
                     far beyond anything the human race has so far been able to muster. Reaching these
                     levels will require an enormous expansion in access to knowledge, on the part of individuals
                     and social organizations alike. Universal education will be an indispensable contributor
                     to this process of capacity building, but the effort will succeed only as human affairs
                     are so reorganized as to enable both individuals and groups in every sector of society
                     to acquire knowledge and apply it to the shaping of human affairs.

                     <a id="990371077" class="brl-location"></a>Throughout recorded history, human consciousness has depended upon two basic knowledge
                     systems through which its potentialities have progressively been expressed: science
                     and religion. Through these two agencies, the race’s experience has been organized,
                     its environment interpreted, its latent powers explored, and its moral and intellectual
                     life disciplined. They have acted as the real progenitors of civilization. With the
                     benefit of hindsight, it is evident, moreover, that the effectiveness of this dual
                     structure has been greatest during those periods when, each in its own sphere, religion
                     and science were able to work in concert. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <a id="681107687" class="brl-location"></a>Given the almost universal respect in which science is currently held, its credentials
                     need no elaboration. In the context of a strategy of social and economic development,
                     the issue rather is how scientific and technological activity is to be organized.
                     If the work involved is viewed chiefly as the preserve of established elites living
                     in a small number of nations, it is obvious that the enormous gap which such an arrangement
                     has already created between the world’s rich and poor will only continue to widen,
                     with the disastrous consequences for the world’s economy already noted. Indeed, if
                     most of humankind continue to be regarded mainly as users of products of science and
                     technology created elsewhere, then programs ostensibly designed to serve their needs
                     cannot properly be termed “development”.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <a id="258643714" class="brl-location"></a>A central challenge, therefore—and an enormous one—is the expansion of scientific
                     and technological activity. Instruments of social and economic change so powerful
                     must cease to be the patrimony of advantaged segments of society, and must be so organized
                     as to permit people everywhere to participate in such activity on the basis of capacity.
                     Apart from the creation of programs that make the required education available to
                     all who are able to benefit from it, such reorganization will require the establishment
                     of viable centers of learning throughout the world, institutions that will enhance
                     the capability of the world’s peoples to participate in the generation and application
                     of knowledge. Development strategy, while acknowledging the wide differences of individual
                     capacity, must take as a major goal the task of making it possible for all of the
                     earth’s inhabitants to approach on an equal basis the processes of science and technology
                     which are their common birthright. Familiar arguments for maintaining the status quo
                     grow daily less compelling as the accelerating revolution in communication technologies
                     now brings information and training within reach of vast numbers of people around
                     the globe, wherever they may be, whatever their cultural backgrounds.

                     <a id="789485371" class="brl-location"></a>The challenges facing humanity in its religious life, if different in character, are
                     equally daunting. For the vast majority of the world’s population, the idea that human
                     nature has a spiritual dimension—indeed that its fundamental identity is spiritual—is
                     a truth requiring no demonstration. It is a perception of reality that can be discovered
                     in the earliest records of civilization and that has been cultivated for several millenia
                     by every one of the great religious traditions of humanity’s past. Its enduring achievements
                     in law, the fine arts, and the civilizing of human intercourse are what give substance
                     and meaning to history. In one form or another its promptings are a daily influence
                     in the lives of most people on earth and, as events around the world today dramatically
                     show, the longings it awakens are both inextinguishable and incalculably potent.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <a id="067747275" class="brl-location"></a>It would seem obvious, therefore, that efforts of any kind to promote human progress
                     must seek to tap capacities so universal and so immensely creative. Why, then, have
                     spiritual issues facing humanity not been central to the development discourse? Why
                     have most of the priorities—indeed most of the underlying assumptions—of the international
                     development agenda been determined so far by materialistic world views to which only
                     small minorities of the earth’s population subscribe? How much weight can be placed
                     on a professed devotion to the principle of universal participation that denies the
                     validity of the participants’ defining cultural experience? 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <a id="439074895" class="brl-location"></a>It may be argued that, since spiritual and moral issues have historically been bound
                     up with contending theological doctrines which are not susceptible of objective proof,
                     these issues lie outside the framework of the international community’s development
                     concerns. To accord them any significant role would be to open the door to precisely
                     those dogmatic influences that have nurtured social conflict and blocked human progress.
                     There is doubtless a measure of truth in such an argument. Exponents of the world’s
                     various theological systems bear a heavy responsibility not only for the disrepute
                     into which faith itself has fallen among many progressive thinkers, but for the inhibitions
                     and distortions produced in humanity’s continuing discourse on spiritual meaning.
                     To conclude, however, that the answer lies in discouraging the investigation of spiritual
                     reality and ignoring the deepest roots of human motivation is a self-evident delusion.
                     The sole effect, to the degree that such censorship has been achieved in recent history,
                     has been to deliver the shaping of humanity’s future into the hands of a new orthodoxy,
                     one which argues that truth is amoral and facts are independent of values.

                     <a id="015873556" class="brl-location"></a>So far as earthly existence is concerned, many of the greatest achievements of religion
                     have been moral in character. Through its teachings and through the examples of human
                     lives illumined by these teachings, masses of people in all ages and lands have developed
                     the capacity to love. They have learned to discipline the animal side of their natures,
                     to make great sacrifices for the common good, to practise forgiveness, generosity,
                     and trust, to use wealth and other resources in ways that serve the advancement of
                     civilization. Institutional systems have been devised to translate these moral advances
                     into the norms of social life on a vast scale. However obscured by dogmatic accretions
                     and diverted by sectarian conflict, the spiritual impulses set in motion by such transcendent
                     figures as Krishna, Moses, Buddha, Zoroaster, Jesus, and Muhammad have been the chief
                     influence in the civilizing of human character.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <a id="016776673" class="brl-location"></a>Since, then, the challenge is the empowerment of humankind through a vast increase
                     in access to knowledge, the strategy that can make this possible must be constructed
                     around an ongoing and intensifying dialogue between science and religion. It is—or
                     by now should be—a truism that, in every sphere of human activity and at every level,
                     the insights and skills that represent scientific accomplishment must look to the
                     force of spiritual commitment and moral principle to ensure their appropriate application.
                     People need, for example, to learn how to separate fact from conjecture—indeed to
                     distinguish between subjective views and objective reality; the extent to which individuals
                     and institutions so equipped can contribute to human progress, however, will be determined
                     by their devotion to truth and their detachment from the promptings of their own interests
                     and passions. Another capacity that science must cultivate in all people is that of
                     thinking in terms of process, including historical process; however, if this intellectual
                     advancement is to contribute ultimately to promoting development, its perspective
                     must be unclouded by prejudices of race, culture, sex, or sectarian belief. Similarly,
                     the training that can make it possible for the earth’s inhabitants to participate
                     in the production of wealth will advance the aims of development only to the extent
                     that such an impulse is illumined by the spiritual insight that service to humankind
                     is the purpose of both individual life and social organization.

                     <a id="216448140" class="brl-location"></a>It is in the context of raising the level of human capacity through the expansion
                     of knowledge at all levels that the economic issues facing humankind need to be addressed.
                     As the experience of recent decades has demonstrated, material benefits and endeavors
                     cannot be regarded as ends in themselves. Their value consists not only in providing
                     for humanity’s basic needs in housing, food, health care, and the like, but in extending
                     the reach of human abilities. The most important role that economic efforts must play
                     in development lies, therefore, in equipping people and institutions with the means
                     through which they can achieve the real purpose of development: that is, laying foundations
                     for a new social order that can cultivate the limitless potentialities latent in human
                     consciousness.
                  </p>

                     <a id="935023914" class="brl-location"></a>The challenge to economic thinking is to accept unambiguously this purpose of development—and
                     its own role in fostering creation of the means to achieve it. Only in this way can
                     economics and the related sciences free themselves from the undertow of the materialistic
                     preoccupations that now distract them, and fulfill their potential as tools vital
                     to achieving human well-being in the full sense of the term. Nowhere is the need for
                     a rigorous dialogue between the work of science and the insights of religion more
                     apparent.

                     <a id="189507989" class="brl-location"></a>The problem of poverty is a case in point. Proposals aimed at addressing it are predicated
                     on the conviction that material resources exist, or can be created by scientific and
                     technological endeavor, which will alleviate and eventually entirely eradicate this
                     age-old condition as a feature of human life. A major reason why such relief is not
                     achieved is that the necessary scientific and technological advances respond to a
                     set of priorities only tangentially related to the real interests of the generality
                     of humankind. A radical reordering of these priorities will be required if the burden
                     of poverty is finally to be lifted from the world. Such an achievement demands a determined
                     quest for appropriate values, a quest that will test profoundly both the spiritual
                     and scientific resources of humankind. Religion will be severely hampered in contributing
                     to this joint undertaking so long as it is held prisoner by sectarian doctrines which
                     cannot distinguish between contentment and mere passivity and which teach that poverty
                     is an inherent feature of earthly life, escape from which lies only in the world beyond.
                     To participate effectively in the struggle to bring material well-being to humanity,
                     the religious spirit must find—in the Source of inspiration from which it flows—new
                     spiritual concepts and principles relevant to an age that seeks to establish unity
                     and justice in human affairs.

                     <a id="116136206" class="brl-location"></a>Unemployment raises similar issues. In most of contemporary thinking, the concept
                     of work has been largely reduced to that of gainful employment aimed at acquiring
                     the means for the consumption of available goods. The system is circular: acquisition
                     and consumption resulting in the maintenance and expansion of the production of goods
                     and, in consequence, in supporting paid employment. Taken individually, all of these
                     activities are essential to the well-being of society. The inadequacy of the overall
                     conception, however, can be read in both the apathy that social commentators discern
                     among large numbers of the employed in every land and the demoralization of the growing
                     armies of the unemployed.

                  <p>
                     <a id="591202069" class="brl-location"></a>Not surprisingly, therefore, there is increasing recognition that the world is in
                     urgent need of a new “work ethic”. Here again, nothing less than insights generated
                     by the creative interaction of the scientific and religious systems of knowledge can
                     produce so fundamental a reorientation of habits and attitudes. Unlike animals, which
                     depend for their sustenance on whatever the environment readily affords, human beings
                     are impelled to express the immense capacities latent within them through productive
                     work designed to meet their own needs and those of others. In acting thus they become
                     participants, at however modest a level, in the processes of the advancement of civilization.
                     They fulfill purposes that unite them with others. To the extent that work is consciously
                     undertaken in a spirit of service to humanity, Bahá’u’lláh says, it is a form of prayer,
                     a means of worshiping God. Every individual has the capacity to see himself or herself
                     in this light, and it is to this inalienable capacity of the self that development
                     strategy must appeal, whatever the nature of the plans being pursued, whatever the
                     rewards they promise. No narrower a perspective will ever call up from the people
                     of the world the magnitude of effort and commitment that the economic tasks ahead
                     will require.

                     <a id="414452699" class="brl-location"></a>A challenge of similar nature faces economic thinking as a result of the environmental
                     crisis. The fallacies in theories based on the belief that there is no limit to nature’s
                     capacity to fulfill any demand made on it by human beings have now been coldly exposed.
                     A culture which attaches absolute value to expansion, to acquisition, and to the satisfaction
                     of people’s wants is being compelled to recognize that such goals are not, by themselves,
                     realistic guides to policy. Inadequate, too, are approaches to economic issues whose
                     decision-making tools cannot deal with the fact that most of the major challenges

                     <a id="935039368" class="brl-location"></a>The earnest hope that this moral crisis can somehow be met by deifying nature itself
                     is an evidence of the spiritual and intellectual desperation that the crisis has engendered.
                     Recognition that creation is an organic whole and that humanity has the responsibility
                     to care for this whole, welcome as it is, does not represent an influence which can
                     by itself establish in the consciousness of people a new system of values. Only a
                     breakthrough in understanding that is scientific and spiritual in the fullest sense
                     of the terms will empower the human race to assume the trusteeship toward which history
                     impels it.

                     <a id="287252200" class="brl-location"></a>All people will have sooner or later to recover, for example, the capacity for contentment,
                     the welcoming of moral discipline, and the devotion to duty that, until relatively
                     recently, were considered essential aspects of being human. Repeatedly throughout
                     history, the teachings of the Founders of the great religions have been able to instill
                     these qualities of character in the mass of people who responded to them. The qualities
                     themselves are even more vital today, but their expression must now take a form consistent
                     with humanity’s coming-of-age. Here again, religion’s challenge is to free itself
                     from the obsessions of the past: contentment is not fatalism; morality has nothing
                     in common with the life-denying puritanism that has so often presumed to speak in
                     its name; and a genuine devotion to duty brings feelings not of self-righteousness
                     but of self-worth.

                     <a id="265608525" class="brl-location"></a>The effect of the persistent denial to women of full equality with men sharpens still
                     further the challenge to science and religion in the economic life of humankind. To
                     any objective observer the principle of the equality of the sexes is fundamental to
                     all realistic thinking about the future well-being of the earth and its people. It
                     represents a truth about human nature that has waited largely unrecognized throughout
                     the long ages of the race’s childhood and adolescence. “Women and men”, is Bahá’u’lláh’s
                     emphatic assertion, “have been and will always be equal in the sight of God.” The
                     rational soul has no sex, and whatever social inequities may have been dictated by
                     the survival requirements of the past, they clearly cannot be justified at a time
                     when humanity stands at the threshold of maturity. A commitment to the establishment
                     of full equality between men and women, in all departments of life and at every level
                     of society, will be central to the success of efforts to conceive and implement a
                     strategy of global development.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <a id="885617576" class="brl-location"></a>Indeed, in an important sense, progress in this area will itself be a measure of the
                     success of any development program. Given the vital role of economic activity in the
                     advancement of civilization, visible evidence of the pace at which development is
                     progressing will be the extent to which women gain access to all avenues of economic
                     endeavor. The challenge goes beyond ensuring an equitable distribution of opportunity,
                     important as that is. It calls for a fundamental rethinking of economic issues in
                     a manner that will invite the full participation of a range of human experience and
                     insight hitherto largely excluded from the discourse. The classical economic models
                     of impersonal markets in which human beings act as autonomous makers of self-regarding
                     choices will not serve the needs of a world motivated by ideals of unity and justice.
                     Society will find itself increasingly challenged to develop new economic models shaped
                     by insights that arise from a sympathetic understanding of shared experience, from
                     viewing human beings in relation to others, and from a recognition of the centrality
                     to social well-being of the role of the family and the community. Such an intellectual
                     breakthrough—strongly altruistic rather than self-centered in focus—must draw heavily
                     on both the spiritual and scientific sensibilities of the race, and millenia of experience
                     have prepared women to make crucial contributions to the common effort.

                     <a id="853505357" class="brl-location"></a>To contemplate a transformation of society on this scale is to raise both the question
                     of the power that can be harnessed to accomplish it and the issue inextricably linked
                     to it, the authority to exercise that power. As with all other implications of the
                     accelerating integration of the planet and its people, both of these familiar terms
                     stand in urgent need of redefinition.

                     <a id="252841835" class="brl-location"></a>Throughout history—and despite theologically or ideologically inspired assurances
                     to the contrary—power has been largely interpreted as advantage enjoyed by persons
                     or groups. Often, indeed, it has been expressed simply in terms of means to be used
                     against others. This interpretation of power has become an inherent feature of the
                     culture of division and conflict that has characterized the human race during the
                     past several millenia, regardless of the social, religious, or political orientations
                     that have enjoyed ascendancy in given ages, in given parts of the world. In general,
                     power has been an attribute of individuals, factions, peoples, classes, and nations.
                     It has been an attribute especially associated with men rather than women. Its chief
                     effect has been to confer on its beneficiaries the ability to acquire, to surpass,
                     to dominate, to resist, to win. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <a id="171689240" class="brl-location"></a>The resulting historical processes have been responsible for both ruinous setbacks
                     in human well-being and extraordinary advances in civilization. To appreciate the
                     benefits is to acknowledge also the setbacks, as well as the clear limitations of
                     the behavioral patterns that have produced both. Habits and attitudes related to the
                     use of power which emerged during the long ages of humanity’s infancy and adolescence
                     have reached the outer limits of their effectiveness. Today, in an era most of whose
                     pressing problems are global in nature, persistence in the idea that power means advantage
                     for various segments of the human family is profoundly mistaken in theory and of no
                     practical service to the social and economic development of the planet. Those who
                     still adhere to it—and who could in earlier eras have felt confident in such adherence—now
                     find their plans enmeshed in inexplicable frustrations and hindrances. In its traditional,
                     competitive expression, power is as irrelevant to the needs of humanity’s future as
                     would be the technologies of railway locomotion to the task of lifting space satellites
                     into orbits around the earth.

                  <p>
                     <a id="369585433" class="brl-location"></a>The analogy is more than a little apt. The human race is being urged by the requirements
                     of its own maturation to free itself from its inherited understanding and use of power.
                     That it can do so is demonstrated by the fact that, although dominated by the traditional
                     conception, humanity has always been able to conceive of power in other forms critical
                     to its hopes. History provides ample evidence that, however intermittently and ineptly,
                     people of every background, throughout the ages, have tapped a wide range of creative
                     resources within themselves. The most obvious example, perhaps, has been the power
                     of truth itself, an agent of change associated with some of the greatest advances
                     in the philosophical, religious, artistic, and scientific experience of the race.
                     Force of character represents yet another means of mobilizing immense human response,
                     as does the influence of example, whether in the lives of individual human beings
                     or in human societies. Almost wholly unappreciated is the magnitude of the force that
                     will be generated by the achievement of unity, an influence “so powerful”, in Bahá’u’lláh’s
                     words, “that it can illuminate the whole Earth.”

                     <a id="089642027" class="brl-location"></a>The institutions of society will succeed in eliciting and directing the potentialities
                     latent in the consciousness of the world’s peoples to the extent that the exercise
                     of authority is governed by principles that are in harmony with the evolving interests
                     of a rapidly maturing human race. Such principles include the obligation of those
                     in authority to win the confidence, respect, and genuine support of those whose actions
                     they seek to govern; to consult openly and to the fullest extent possible with all
                     whose interests are affected by decisions being arrived at; to assess in an objective
                     manner both the real needs and the aspirations of the communities they serve; to benefit
                     from scientific and moral advancement in order to make appropriate use of the community’s
                     resources, including the energies of its members. No single principle of effective
                     authority is so important as giving priority to building and maintaining unity among
                     the members of a society and the members of its administrative institutions. Reference
                     has already been made to the intimately associated issue of commitment to the search
                     for justice in all matters.

                     <a id="188436234" class="brl-location"></a>Clearly, such principles can operate only within a culture that is essentially democratic
                     in spirit and method. To say this, however, is not to endorse the ideology of partisanship
                     that has everywhere boldly assumed democracy’s name and which, despite impressive
                     contributions to human progress in the past, today finds itself mired in the cynicism,
                     apathy, and corruption to which it has given rise. In selecting those who are to take
                     collective decisions on its behalf, society does not need and is not well served by
                     the political theater of nominations, candidature, electioneering, and solicitation.
                     It lies within the capacity of all people, as they become progressively educated and
                     convinced that their real development interests are being served by programs proposed
                     to them, to adopt electoral procedures that will gradually refine the selection of
                     their decision-making bodies.

                     <a id="893651012" class="brl-location"></a>As the integration of humanity gains momentum, those who are thus selected will increasingly
                     have to see all their efforts in a global perspective. Not only at the national, but
                     also at the local level, the elected governors of human affairs should, in Bahá’u’lláh’s
                     view, consider themselves responsible for the welfare of all of humankind.

                     coming-of-age constitutes a challenge to reshape fundamentally all the institutions
                     of society. The protagonists to whom the challenge addresses itself are all of the
                     inhabitants of the planet: the generality of humankind, members of governing institutions
                     at all levels, persons serving in agencies of international coordination, scientists
                     and social thinkers, all those endowed with artistic talents or with access to the
                     media of communication, and leaders of nongovernmental organizations. The response
                     called for must base itself on an unconditioned recognition of the oneness of humankind,
                     a commitment to the establishment of justice as the organizing principle of society,

                     dialogue between the scientific and religious genius of the race can bring to the
                     building of human capacity. The enterprise requires a radical rethinking of most of
                     the concepts and assumptions currently governing social and economic life. It must
                     be wedded, as well, to a conviction that, however long the process and whatever setbacks
                     may be encountered, the governance of human affairs can be conducted along lines that
                     serve humanity’s real needs.

                     adulthood is dawning does such a prospect represent more than another utopian mirage.
                     To imagine that an effort of the magnitude envisioned here can be summoned up by despondent
                     and mutually antagonistic peoples and nations runs counter to the whole of received
                     wisdom. Only if, as Bahá’u’lláh asserts to be the case, the course of social evolution
                     has arrived at one of those decisive turning points through which all of the phenomena
                     of existence are impelled suddenly forward into new stages of their development, can
                     such a possibility be conceived. A profound conviction that just so great a transformation

                     To all who recognize in it familiar promptings from within their own hearts, Bahá’u’lláh’s
                     words bring assurance that God has, in this matchless day, endowed humanity with spiritual
                     resources fully equal to the challenge:

                     humanity. The greatest error that the world’s leadership could make at this juncture,
                     however, would be to allow the crisis to cast doubt on the ultimate outcome of the
                     process that is occurring. A world is passing away and a new one is struggling to
                     be born. The habits, attitudes, and institutions that have accumulated over the centuries
                     are being subjected to tests that are as necessary to human development as they are
                     inescapable. What is required of the peoples of the world is a measure of faith and
                     resolve to match the enormous energies with which the Creator of all things has endowed
                     this spiritual springtime of the race. “Be united in counsel,” is Bahá’u’lláh’s appeal,
