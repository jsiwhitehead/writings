                  <p class="brl-firstline-noindent">
                     <a id="084463976" class="brl-location"></a>At Riḍván 2002, we addressed an open letter to the world’s religious leaders. Our
                     action arose out of awareness that the disease of sectarian hatreds, if not decisively
                     checked, threatens harrowing consequences that will leave few areas of the world unaffected.
                     The letter acknowledged with appreciation the achievements of the interfaith movement,
                     to which Bahá’ís have sought to contribute since an early point in the movement’s
                     emergence. Nevertheless, we felt we must be forthright in saying that, if the religious
                     crisis is to be addressed as seriously as is occurring with respect to other prejudices
                     afflicting humankind, organized religion must find within itself a comparable courage
                     to rise above fixed conceptions inherited from a distant past.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <a id="093219334" class="brl-location"></a>Above all, we expressed our conviction that the time has come when religious leadership
                     must face honestly and without further evasion the implications of the truth that
                     God is one and that, beyond all diversity of cultural expression and human interpretation,
                     religion is likewise one. It was intimations of this truth that originally inspired
                     the interfaith movement and that have sustained it through the vicissitudes of the
                     past one hundred years. Far from challenging the validity of any of the great revealed
                     faiths, the principle has the capacity to ensure their continuing relevance. In order
                     to exert its influence, however, recognition of this reality must operate at the heart
                     of religious discourse, and it was with this in mind that we felt that our letter
                     should be explicit in articulating it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <a id="583370226" class="brl-location"></a>Response has been encouraging. Bahá’í institutions throughout the world ensured that
                     thousands of copies of the document were delivered to influential figures in the major
                     faith communities. While it was perhaps not surprising that the message it contained
                     was dismissed out of hand in a few circles, Bahá’ís report that, in general, they
                     were warmly welcomed. Particularly affecting has been the obvious sincerity of many
                     recipients’ distress over the failure of religious institutions to assist humanity
                     in dealing with challenges whose essential nature is spiritual and moral. Discussions
                     have turned readily to the need for fundamental change in the way the believing masses
                     of humankind relate to one another, and in a significant number of instances, those
                     receiving the letter have been moved to reproduce and distribute it to other clerics
                     in their respective traditions. We feel hopeful that our initiative may serve as a
                     catalyst opening the way to new understanding of religion’s purpose.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <a id="099545027" class="brl-location"></a>However rapidly or slowly this change occurs, the concern of Bahá’ís must be with
                     their own responsibility in the matter. The task of ensuring that His message is engaged
                     by people everywhere is one that Bahá’u’lláh has laid primarily on the shoulders of
                     those who have recognized Him. This, of course, has been the work that the Bahá’í
                     community has been pursuing throughout the history of the Faith, but the accelerating
                     breakdown in social order calls out desperately for the religious spirit to be freed
                     from the shackles that have so far prevented it from bringing to bear the healing
                     influence of which it is capable.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <a id="165855408" class="brl-location"></a>If they are to respond to the need, Bahá’ís must draw on a deep understanding of the
                     process by which humanity’s spiritual life evolves. Bahá’u’lláh’s writings provide
                     insights that can help to elevate discussion of religious issues above sectarian and
                     transient considerations. The responsibility to avail oneself of this spiritual resource
                     is inseparable from the gift of faith itself. “Religious fanaticism and hatred”, Bahá’u’lláh
                     warns, “are a world-devouring fire, whose violence none can quench. The Hand of Divine
                     power can, alone, deliver mankind from this desolating affliction.…” Far from feeling
                     unsupported in their efforts to respond, Bahá’ís will come increasingly to appreciate
                     that the Cause they serve represents the arrowhead of an awakening taking place among
                     people everywhere, regardless of religious background and indeed among many with no
                     religious leaning.

                     <a id="956974287" class="brl-location"></a>Reflection on the challenge has prompted us to commission the commentary that follows.
                     <em>One Common Faith</em>, prepared under our supervision, reviews relevant passages from both the writings
                     of Bahá’u’lláh and the scriptures of other faiths against the background of the contemporary
                     crisis. We commend it to the thoughtful study of the friends.

                     <a id="882295758" class="brl-location"></a>There is every reason for confidence that the period of history now opening will be
                     far more receptive to efforts to spread Bahá’u’lláh’s message than was the case in
                     the century just ended. All the signs indicate that a sea change in human consciousness
                     is under way.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <a id="197259257" class="brl-location"></a>Early in the twentieth century, a materialistic interpretation of reality had consolidated
                     itself so completely as to become the dominant world faith insofar as the direction
                     of society was concerned. In the process, the civilizing of human nature had been
                     violently wrenched out of the orbit it had followed for millennia. For many in the
                     West, the Divine authority that had functioned as the focal centre of guidance—however
                     diverse the interpretations of its nature—seemed simply to have dissolved and vanished.
                     In large measure, the individual was left free to maintain whatever relationship he
                     believed connected his life to a world transcending material existence, but society
                     as a whole proceeded with growing confidence to sever dependence on a conception of
                     the universe that was judged to be at best a fiction and at worst an opiate, in either
                     case inhibiting progress. Humanity had taken its destiny into its own hands. It had
                     solved through rational experimentation and discourse—so people were given to believe—all
                     of the fundamental issues related to human governance and development.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <a id="083670001" class="brl-location"></a>This posture was reinforced by the assumption that the values, ideals and disciplines
                     cultivated over the centuries were now reliably fixed and enduring features of human
                     nature. They needed merely to be refined by education and reinforced by legislative
                     action. The moral legacy of the past was just that: humanity’s indefeasible inheritance,
                     requiring no further religious interventions. Admittedly, undisciplined individuals,
                     groups or even nations would continue to threaten the stability of the social order
                     and call for correction. The universal civilization towards the realization of which
                     all the forces of history had been bearing the human race, however, was irresistibly
                     emerging, inspired by secular conceptions of reality. People’s happiness would be
                     the natural result of better health, better food, better education, better living
                     conditions—and the attainment of these unquestionably desirable goals now seemed to
                     be within the reach of a society single-mindedly focused on their pursuit.

                     <a id="998943724" class="brl-location"></a>Throughout that part of the world where the vast majority of the earth’s population
                     live, facile announcements that “God is Dead” had passed largely unnoticed. The experience
                     of the peoples of Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Pacific had long confirmed them
                     in the view not only that human nature is deeply influenced by spiritual forces, but
                     that its very identity is spiritual. Consequently, religion continued, as had always
                     been the case, to function as the ultimate authority in life. These convictions, while
                     not directly confronted by the ideological revolution taking place in the West, were
                     effectively marginalized by it, insofar as interaction among peoples and nations was
                     concerned. Having penetrated and captured all significant centres of power and information
                     at the global level, dogmatic materialism ensured that no competing voices would retain
                     the ability to challenge projects of world wide economic exploitation. To the cultural
                     damage already inflicted by two centuries of colonial rule was added an agonizing
                     disjunction between the inner and outer experience of the masses affected, a condition
                     invading virtually all aspects of life. Helpless to exercise any real influence over
                     the shaping of their futures or even to preserve the moral well-being of their children,
                     these populations were plunged into a crisis different from but in many ways even
                     more devastating than the one gathering momentum in Europe and North America. Although
                     retaining its central role in consciousness, faith appeared impotent to influence
                     the course of events.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <a id="282683105" class="brl-location"></a>As the twentieth century approached its close, therefore, nothing seemed less likely
                     than a sudden resurgence of religion as a subject of consuming global importance.
                     Yet that is precisely what has now occurred in the form of a groundswell of anxiety
                     and discontent, much of it still only dimly conscious of the sense of spiritual emptiness
                     that is producing it. Ancient sectarian conflicts, apparently unresponsive to the
                     patient arts of diplomacy, have re-emerged with a virulence as great as anything known
                     before. Scriptural themes, miraculous phenomena and theological dogmas that, until
                     recently, had been dismissed as relics of an age of ignorance find themselves solemnly,
                     if indiscriminately, explored in influential media. In many lands, religious credentials
                     take on new and compelling significance in the candidature of aspirants to political
                     office. A world, which had assumed that with the collapse of the Berlin Wall an age
                     of international peace had dawned, is warned that it is in the grip of a war of civilizations
                     whose defining character is irreconcilable religious antipathies. Bookstores, magazine
                     stands, Web sites and libraries struggle to satisfy an apparently inexhaustible public
                     appetite for information on religious and spiritual subjects. Perhaps the most insistent
                     factor in producing the change is reluctant recognition that there is no credible
                     replacement for religious belief as a force capable of generating self-discipline
                     and restoring commitment to moral behaviour.

                     <a id="651093940" class="brl-location"></a>Beyond the attention that religion, as formally conceived, has begun to command is
                     a widespread revival of spiritual search. Expressed most commonly as an urge to discover
                     a personal identity that transcends the merely physical, the development encourages
                     a multitude of pursuits, both positive and negative in character. On the one hand,
                     the search for justice and the promotion of the cause of international peace tend
                     to have the effect of also arousing new perceptions of the individual’s role in society.
                     Similarly, although focused on the mobilization of support for changes in social decision-making,
                     movements like environmentalism and feminism induce a re-examination of people’s sense
                     of themselves and of their purpose in life. A reorientation occurring in all the major
                     religious communities is the accelerating migration of believers from traditional
                     branches of the parent faiths to sects that attach primary importance to the spiritual
                     search and personal experiences of their members. At the opposite pole, extraterrestrial
                     sightings, “self-discovery” regimens, wilderness retreats, charismatic exaltation,
                     various New Age enthusiasms, and the consciousness-raising efficacy attributed to
                     narcotics and hallucinogens attract followings far larger and more diverse than anything
                     enjoyed by spiritualism or theosophy at a similar historical turning point a century
                     ago. For a Bahá’í, the proliferation even of cults and practices that may arouse aversion
                     in the minds of many serves primarily as a reminder of the insight embodied in the
                     ancient tale of Majnún, who sifted the dust in his search for the beloved Laylí, although
                     aware that she was pure spirit: “I seek her everywhere; haply somewhere I shall find
                     her.”<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#573339202">1</a></sup>

                     <a id="630828940" class="brl-location"></a>The reawakened interest in religion is clearly far from having reached its peak, in
                     either its explicitly religious or its less definable spiritual manifestations. On
                     the contrary. The phenomenon is the product of historical forces that steadily gather
                     momentum. Their common effect is to erode the certainty, bequeathed to the world by
                     the twentieth century, that material existence represents ultimate reality.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <a id="212834175" class="brl-location"></a>The most obvious cause of these re-evaluations has been the bankruptcy of the materialist
                     enterprise itself. For well over a hundred years, the idea of progress was identified
                     with economic development and with its capacity to motivate and shape social improvement.
                     Those differences of opinion that existed did not challenge this world view, but only
                     conceptions as to how its goals might best be attained. Its most extreme form, the
                     iron dogma of “scientific materialism”, sought to reinterpret every aspect of history
                     and human behaviour in its own narrow terms. Whatever humanitarian ideals may have
                     inspired some of its early proponents, the universal consequence was to produce regimes
                     of totalitarian control prepared to use any means of coercion in regulating the lives
                     of hapless populations subjected to them. The goal held up as justification of such
                     abuses was the creation of a new kind of society that would ensure not only freedom
                     from want but fulfilment for the human spirit. At the end, after eight decades of
                     mounting folly and brutality, the movement collapsed as a credible guide to the world’s
                     future.

                     <a id="812499550" class="brl-location"></a>Other systems of social experimentation, while repudiating recourse to inhumane methods,
                     nevertheless derived their moral and intellectual thrust from the same limited conception
                     of reality. The view took root that, since people were essentially self-interested
                     actors in matters pertaining to their economic well-being, the building of just and
                     prosperous societies could be ensured by one or another scheme of what was described
                     as modernization. The closing decades of the twentieth century, however, sagged under
                     a mounting burden of evidence to the contrary: the breakdown of family life, soaring
                     crime, dysfunctional educational systems, and a catalogue of other social pathologies
                     that bring to mind the sombre words of Bahá’u’lláh’s warning about the impending condition
                     of human society: “Such shall be its plight, that to disclose it now would not be
                     meet and seemly.”<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#162291477">2</a></sup>

                     <a id="497819376" class="brl-location"></a>The fate of what the world has learned to call social and economic development has
                     left no doubt that not even the most idealistic motives can correct materialism’s
                     fundamental flaws. Born in the wake of the chaos of the Second World War, “development”
                     became by far the largest and most ambitious collective undertaking on which the human
                     race has ever embarked. Its humanitarian motivation matched its enormous material
                     and technological investment. Fifty years later, while acknowledging the impressive
                     benefits development has brought, the enterprise must be adjudged, by its own standards,
                     a disheartening failure. Far from narrowing the gap between the well-being of the
                     small segment of the human family who enjoy the benefits of modernity and the condition
                     of the vast populations mired in hopeless want, the collective effort that began with
                     such high hopes has seen the gap widen into an abyss.

                     <a id="067921453" class="brl-location"></a>Consumer culture, today’s inheritor by default of materialism’s gospel of human betterment,
                     is unembarrassed by the ephemeral nature of the goals that inspire it. For the small
                     minority of people who can afford them, the benefits it offers are immediate, and
                     the rationale unapologetic. Emboldened by the breakdown of traditional morality, the
                     advance of the new creed is essentially no more than the triumph of animal impulse,
                     as instinctive and blind as appetite, released at long last from the restraints of
                     supernatural sanctions. Its most obvious casualty has been language. Tendencies once
                     universally castigated as moral failings mutate into necessities of social progress.
                     Selfishness becomes a prized commercial resource; falsehood reinvents itself as public
                     information; perversions of various kinds unabashedly claim the status of civil rights.
                     Under appropriate euphemisms, greed, lust, indolence, pride—even violence—acquire
                     not merely broad acceptance but social and economic value. Ironically, as words have
                     been drained of meaning, so have the very material comforts and acquisitions for which
                     truth has been casually sacrificed.

                     <a id="435808806" class="brl-location"></a>Clearly, materialism’s error has lain not in the laudable effort to improve the conditions
                     of life, but in the narrowness of mind and unjustified self-confidence that have defined
                     its mission. The importance both of material prosperity and of the scientific and
                     technological advances necessary to its achievement is a theme that runs through the
                     writings of the Bahá’í Faith. As was inevitable from the outset, however, arbitrary
                     efforts to disengage such physical and material well-being from humanity’s spiritual
                     and moral development have ended by forfeiting the allegiance of the very populations
                     whose interests a materialistic culture purports to serve. “Witness how the world
                     is being afflicted with a fresh calamity every day”, Bahá’u’lláh warns. “Its sickness
                     is approaching the stage of utter hopelessness, inasmuch as the true Physician is
                     debarred from administering the remedy, whilst unskilled practitioners are regarded
                     with favour, and are accorded full freedom to act.”<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#073589584">3</a></sup>

                     undermining the misconceptions about reality that humanity brought into the twenty-first
                     century is global integration. At the simplest level, it takes the form of advances
                     in communication technologies that open broad avenues of interaction among the planet’s
                     diverse populations. Along with facilitating interpersonal and intersocial exchanges,
                     general access to information has the effect of transmuting the cumulative learning
                     of the ages, until recently the preserve of privileged elites, into the patrimony
                     of the entire human family, without distinction of nation, race or culture. With all
                     the gross inequities that global integration perpetuates—indeed intensifies—no informed
                     observer can fail to acknowledge the stimulus to reflection about reality that such
                     changes have produced. With reflection has come a questioning of all established authority,
                     no longer merely that of religion and morality, but also of government, academia,
                     commerce, the media and, increasingly, scientific opinion.

                     more direct effects on thought. It would be impossible to exaggerate, for example,
                     the transformative impact on global consciousness that has resulted from mass travel
                     on an international scale. Greater still have been the consequences of the enormous
                     migrations that the world has witnessed during the century and a half since the Báb
                     declared His mission. Millions of refugees fleeing from persecution have swept like
                     tidal waves back and forth across the European, African and Asiatic continents, particularly.
                     Amid the suffering such turmoil has caused, one perceives the progressive integration
                     of the world’s races and cultures as the citizenry of a single global homeland. As
                     a result, people of every background have been exposed to the cultures and norms of
                     others about whom their forefathers knew little or nothing, exciting a search for
                     meaning that cannot be evaded.

                     <a id="776967881" class="brl-location"></a>It is impossible to imagine how different the history of the past century and a half
                     would have been had any of the leading arbiters of world affairs addressed by Bahá’u’lláh
                     spared time for reflection on a conception of reality supported by the moral credentials
                     of its Author, moral credentials of the kind they professed to hold in the highest
                     regard. What is unmistakable to a Bahá’í is that, despite such failure, the transformations
                     announced in Bahá’u’lláh’s message are resistlessly accomplishing themselves. Through
                     shared discoveries and shared travails, peoples of diverse cultures are brought face
                     to face with the common humanity lying just beneath the surface of imagined differences
                     of identity. Whether stubbornly opposed in some societies or welcomed elsewhere as
                     a release from meaningless and suffocating limitations, the sense that the earth’s
                     inhabitants are indeed “the leaves of one tree”<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#224671113">4</a></sup> is slowly becoming the standard by which humanity’s collective efforts are now judged.

                     are surrendered; once unthinkable demands are accepted. It is this universal upheaval,
                     Bahá’u’lláh explains, for which the scriptures of past religions employed the imagery

                     achievements in music, architecture, and the other arts, endlessly replicating the
                     soul’s experience for millions of their fellow believers. No other force in existence
                     has been able to elicit from people comparable qualities of heroism, self-sacrifice
                     and self-discipline. At the social level, the resulting moral principles have repeatedly
                     translated themselves into universal codes of law, regulating and elevating human
                     relationships. Viewed in perspective, the major religions emerge as the primary driving
                     forces of the civilizing process. To argue otherwise is surely to ignore the evidence
                     of history.

                     <a id="621182228" class="brl-location"></a>Why, then, does this immensely rich heritage not serve as the central stage for today’s
                     reawakening of spiritual quest? On the periphery, earnest attempts are being made
                     to reformulate the teachings that gave rise to the respective faiths, in the hope
                     of imbuing them with new appeal, but the greater part of the search for meaning is
                     diffused, individualistic and incoherent in character. The scriptures have not changed;
                     the moral principles they contain have lost none of their validity. No one who sincerely
                     poses questions to Heaven, if he persists, will fail to detect an answering voice
                     in the Psalms or in the Upanishads. Anyone with some intimation of the Reality that
                     transcends this material one will be touched to the heart by the words in which Jesus
                     or Buddha speaks so intimately of it. The Qur’án’s apocalyptic visions continue to
                     provide compelling assurance to its readers that the realization of justice is central
                     to the Divine purpose. Nor, in their essential features, do the lives of heroes and
                     saints seem any less meaningful than they did when those lives were lived centuries
                     ago. For many religious people, therefore, the most painful aspect of the current
                     crisis of civilization is that the search for truth has not turned with confidence
                     into religion’s familiar avenues.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <a id="560852238" class="brl-location"></a>The problem is, of course, twofold. The rational soul does not merely occupy a private
                     sphere, but is an active participant in a social order. Although the received truths
                     of the great faiths remain valid, the daily experience of an individual in the twenty-first
                     century is unimaginably removed from the one that he or she would have known in any
                     of those ages when this guidance was revealed. Democratic decision-making has fundamentally
                     altered the relationship of the individual to authority. With growing confidence and
                     growing success, women justly insist on their right to full equality with men. Revolutions
                     in science and technology change not only the functioning but the conception of society,
                     indeed of existence itself. Universal education and an explosion of new fields of
                     creativity open the way to insights that stimulate social mobility and integration,
                     and create opportunities of which the rule of law encourages the citizen to take full
                     advantage. Stem cell research, nuclear energy, sexual identity, ecological stress
                     and the use of wealth raise, at the very least, social questions that have no precedent.
                     These, and the countless other changes affecting every aspect of human life, have
                     brought into being a new world of daily choices for both society and its members.
                     What has not changed is the inescapable requirement of making such choices, whether
                     for better or worse. It is here that the spiritual nature of the contemporary crisis
                     comes into sharpest focus because most of the decisions called for are not merely
                     practical but moral. In large part, therefore, loss of faith in traditional religion
                     has been an inevitable consequence of failure to discover in it the guidance required
                     to live with modernity, successfully and with assurance.

                     <a id="682994995" class="brl-location"></a>A second barrier to a re-emergence of inherited systems of belief as the answer to
                     humanity’s spiritual yearnings is the effects already mentioned of global integration.
                     Throughout the planet, people raised in a given religious frame of reference find
                     themselves abruptly thrown into close association with others whose beliefs and practices
                     appear at first glance irreconcilably different from their own. The differences can
                     and often do give rise to defensiveness, simmering resentments and open conflict.
                     In many cases, however, the effect is rather to prompt a reconsideration of received
                     doctrine and to encourage efforts at discovering values held in common. The support
                     enjoyed by various interfaith activities doubtless owes a great deal to response of
                     this kind among the general public. Inevitably, with such approaches comes a questioning
                     of religious doctrines that inhibit association and understanding. If people whose
                     beliefs appear to be fundamentally different from one’s own nevertheless live moral
                     lives that deserve admiration, what is it that makes one’s own faith superior to theirs?
                     Alternatively, if all of the great religions share certain basic values in common,
                     do not sectarian attachments run the risk of merely reinforcing unwanted barriers
                     between an individual and his neighbours?

                  <p>
                     <a id="085061913" class="brl-location"></a>Few today among those who have some degree of objective familiarity with the subject
                     are likely, therefore, to entertain an illusion that any one of the established religious
                     systems of the past can assume the role of ultimate guide for humankind in the issues
                     of contemporary life, even in the improbable event that its disparate sects should
                     come together for that purpose. Each one of what the world regards as independent
                     religions is set in the mould created by its authoritative scripture and its history.
                     As it cannot refashion its system of belief in a manner to derive legitimacy from
                     the authoritative words of its Founder, it likewise cannot adequately answer the multitude
                     of questions posed by social and intellectual evolution. Distressing as this may appear
                     to many, it is no more than an inherent feature of the evolutionary process. Attempts
                     to force a reversal of some kind can lead only to still greater disenchantment with
                     religion itself and exacerbate sectarian conflict.

                     <a id="753493264" class="brl-location"></a>The dilemma is both artificial and self-inflicted. The world order, if it can be so
                     described, within which Bahá’ís today pursue the work of sharing Bahá’u’lláh’s message
                     is one whose misconceptions about both human nature and social evolution are so fundamental
                     as to severely inhibit the most intelligent and well-intentioned endeavours at human
                     betterment. Particularly is this true with respect to the confusion that surrounds
                     virtually every aspect of the subject of religion. In order to respond adequately
                     to the spiritual needs of their neighbours, Bahá’ís will have to gain an in-depth
                     understanding of the issues involved. The effort of imagination this challenge requires
                     can be appreciated from the advice that is perhaps the most frequently and urgently
                     reiterated admonition in the writings of their Faith: to “meditate”, to “ponder”,
                     to “reflect”.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <a id="702356321" class="brl-location"></a>A commonplace of popular discourse is that by “religion” is intended the multitude
                     of sects currently in existence. Not surprisingly, such a suggestion at once arouses
                     protest in other quarters that by religion is intended rather one or another of the
                     great, independent belief systems of history that have shaped and inspired whole civilizations.
                     This point of view, in turn, however, runs up against the inevitable query as to where
                     one will find these historic faiths in the contemporary world. Where, precisely, are
                     “Judaism”, “Buddhism”, “Christianity”, “Islám” and the others, since they obviously
                     cannot be identified with the irreconcilably opposed organizations that purport to
                     speak authoritatively in their names? Nor does the problem end there. Yet another
                     response to the enquiry will almost certainly be that by religion is intended simply
                     an attitude to life, a sense of relationship with a Reality that transcends material
                     existence. Religion, so conceived, is an attribute of the individual person, an impulse
                     not susceptible of organization, an experience universally available. Again, however,
                     such an orientation will be seen by a majority of religiously minded persons as lacking
                     the very authority of self-discipline and the unifying effect that give religion meaning.
                     Some objectors would even argue that, on the contrary, religion signifies the lifestyle
                     of persons who, like themselves, have adopted severe regimens of daily ritual and
                     self-denial that set them entirely apart from the rest of society. What all such differing
                     conceptions have in common is the extent to which a phenomenon that is acknowledged
                     to completely transcend human reach has nevertheless gradually been imprisoned within
                     conceptual limits—whether organizational, theological, experiential or ritualistic—of
                     human invention.

                     <a id="332352309" class="brl-location"></a>The teachings of Bahá’u’lláh cut through this tangle of inconsistent views and, in
                     doing so, reformulate many truths which, whether explicitly or implicitly, have lain
                     at the heart of all Divine revelation. Although in no way a comprehensive reading
                     of His intent, Bahá’u’lláh makes it clear that attempts to capture or suggest the
                     Reality of God in catechisms and creeds are exercises in self-deception: “To every
                     discerning and illumined heart it is evident that God, the unknowable Essence, the
                     divine Being, is immensely exalted beyond every human attribute, such as corporeal
                     existence, ascent and descent, egress and regress. Far be it from His glory that human
                     tongue should adequately recount His praise, or that human heart comprehend His fathomless
                     mystery.”<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#543210762">9</a></sup> The instrumentality through which the Creator of all things interacts with the ever-evolving
                     creation He has brought into being is the appearance of prophetic Figures who manifest
                     the attributes of an inaccessible Divinity: “The door of the knowledge of the Ancient
                     of Days being thus closed in the face of all beings, the Source of infinite grace
                     … hath caused those luminous Gems of Holiness to appear out of the realm of the spirit,
                     in the noble form of the human temple, and be made manifest unto all men, that they
                     may impart unto the world the mysteries of the unchangeable Being, and tell of the
                     subtleties of His imperishable Essence.”<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#279881784">10</a></sup>
                     
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <a id="567554725" class="brl-location"></a>To presume to judge among the Messengers of God, exalting one above the other, would
                     be to give in to the delusion that the Eternal and All-Embracing is subject to the
                     vagaries of human preference. “It is clear and evident to thee”, are Bahá’u’lláh’s
                     precise words, “that all the Prophets are the Temples of the Cause of God, Who have
                     appeared clothed in divers attire. If thou wilt observe with discriminating eyes,
                     thou wilt behold Them all abiding in the same tabernacle, soaring in the same heaven,
                     seated upon the same throne, uttering the same speech, and proclaiming the same Faith.”<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#535184570">11</a></sup> To imagine, further, that the nature of these unique Figures can be—or needs to be—encompassed
                     within theories borrowed from physical experience is equally presumptuous. What is
                     meant by “knowledge of God”, Bahá’u’lláh explains, is knowledge of the Manifestations
                     Who reveal His will and attributes, and it is here that the soul comes into intimate
                     association with a Creator Who is otherwise beyond both language and apprehension:
                     “I bear witness”, is Bahá’u’lláh’s assertion about the station of the Manifestation
                     of God, “…that through Thy beauty the beauty of the Adored One hath been unveiled,
                     and through Thy face the face of the Desired One hath shone forth.…”<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#743744339">12</a></sup>
                     
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <a id="209044435" class="brl-location"></a>Religion, thus conceived, awakens the soul to potentialities that are otherwise unimaginable.
                     To the extent that an individual learns to benefit from the influence of the revelation
                     of God for his age, his nature becomes progressively imbued with the attributes of
                     the Divine world: “Through the Teachings of this Day Star of Truth”, Bahá’u’lláh explains,
                     “every man will advance and develop until he … can manifest all the potential forces
                     with which his inmost true self hath been endowed.”<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#419231921">13</a></sup> As humanity’s purpose includes the carrying forward of “an ever-advancing civilization”,<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#924825349">14</a></sup> not the least of the extraordinary powers that religion possesses has been its ability
                     to free those who believe from the limitations of time itself, eliciting from them
                     sacrifices on behalf of generations centuries into the future. Indeed, because the
                     soul is immortal, its awakening to its true nature empowers it, not only in this world
                     but even more directly in those worlds that lie beyond, to serve the evolutionary
                     process: “The light which these souls radiate”, Bahá’u’lláh asserts, “is responsible
                     for the progress of the world and the advancement of its peoples.… All things must
                     needs have a cause, a motive power, an animating principle. These souls and symbols
                     of detachment have provided, and will continue to provide, the supreme moving impulse
                     in the world of being.”<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#989957053">15</a></sup>
                     
                  </p>

                     <a id="281627400" class="brl-location"></a>Belief is thus a necessary and inextinguishable urge of the species that has been
                     described by an influential modern thinker as “evolution become conscious of itself”.<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#011593785">16</a></sup> If, as the events of the twentieth century provide sad and compelling evidence, the
                     natural expression of faith is artificially blocked, it will invent objects of worship
                     however unworthy—or even debased—that may in some measure appease the yearning for
                     certitude. It is an impulse that will not be denied.

                     <a id="941193502" class="brl-location"></a>In short, through the ongoing process of revelation, the One Who is the Source of
                     the system of knowledge we call religion demonstrates that system’s integrity and
                     its freedom from the contradictions imposed by sectarian ambitions. The work of each
                     Manifestation of God has an autonomy and an authority that transcend appraisal; it
                     is also a stage in the limitless unfolding of a single Reality. Because the purpose
                     of the successive revelations of God is the awakening of humankind to its capacities
                     and responsibilities as the trustee of creation, the process is not simply repetitive,
                     but progressive, and is fully appreciated only when perceived in this context.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <a id="232316620" class="brl-location"></a>In no sense can Bahá’ís profess to have grasped at this early hour more than a minute
                     portion of the truths inherent in the revelation on which their Faith is based. With
                     reference, for example, to the evolution of the Cause, the Guardian said, “All we
                     can reasonably venture to attempt is to strive to obtain a glimpse of the first streaks
                     of the promised Dawn that must, in the fullness of time, chase away the gloom that
                     has encircled humanity.”<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#787678045">17</a></sup> Apart from encouraging humility, this fact should serve also as a constant reminder
                     that Bahá’u’lláh has not brought into existence a new religion to stand beside the
                     present multiplicity of sectarian organizations. Rather has He recast the whole conception
                     of religion as the principal force impelling the development of consciousness. As
                     the human race in all its diversity is a single species, so the intervention by which
                     God cultivates the qualities of mind and heart latent in that species is a single
                     process. Its heroes and saints are the heroes and saints of all stages in the struggle;
                     its successes, the successes of all stages. This is the standard demonstrated in the
                     life and work of the Master and exemplified today in a Bahá’í community that has become
                     the inheritor of humanity’s entire spiritual legacy, a legacy equally available to
                     all the earth’s peoples.

                     <a id="069453332" class="brl-location"></a>The recurring proof of the existence of God, therefore, is that from time immemorial
                     He has repeatedly manifested Himself. In the larger sense, as Bahá’u’lláh explains,
                     the vast epic of humanity’s religious history represents the fulfilment of the “Covenant”,
                     the enduring promise by which the Creator of all things assures the race of the unfailing
                     guidance essential to its spiritual and moral development, and calls on it to internalize
                     and give expression to these values. One is free to dispute through historicist interpretations
                     of the evidence the unique role of this or that Messenger of God, if that is one’s
                     purpose, but such speculation is of no help in accounting for developments that have
                     transformed thought and produced changes in human relationships critical to social
                     evolution. At intervals so rare that the known instances can be counted on one’s fingers,
                     the Manifestations of God have appeared, have each been explicit as to the authority
                     of His teachings and have each exerted an influence on the advance of civilization
                     incomparably beyond that of any other phenomenon in history. “Consider the hour at
                     which the supreme Manifestation of God revealeth Himself unto men”, Bahá’u’lláh points
                     out: “Ere that hour cometh, the Ancient Being, Who is still unknown of men and hath
                     not as yet given utterance to the Word of God, is Himself the All-Knower in a world
                     devoid of any man that hath known Him. He is indeed the Creator without a creation.”<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#814762626">18</a></sup>

                     <a id="952049861" class="brl-location"></a>The objection most commonly raised against the foregoing conception of religion is
                     the assertion that the differences among the revealed faiths are so fundamental that
                     to present them as stages or aspects of one unified system of truth does violence
                     to the facts. Given the confusion surrounding the nature of religion, the reaction
                     is understandable. Chiefly, however, such an objection offers Bahá’ís an invitation
                     to set the principles reviewed here more explicitly in the evolutionary context provided
                     in Bahá’u’lláh’s writings.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <a id="714259049" class="brl-location"></a>The differences referred to fall into the categories of either practice or doctrine,
                     both of them presented as the intent of the relevant scriptures. In the case of religious
                     customs governing personal life, it is helpful to view the subject against the background
                     of comparable features of material life. It is most unlikely that diversity in hygiene,
                     dress, medicine, diet, transportation, warfare, construction or economic activity,
                     however striking, would any longer be seriously advanced in support of a theory that
                     humanity does not in fact constitute one people, single and unique. Until the opening
                     of the twentieth century, such simplistic arguments were commonplace, but historical
                     and anthropological research now provides a seamless panorama of the process of cultural
                     evolution by which these and countless other expressions of human creativity came
                     into existence, were transmitted through successive generations, underwent gradual
                     metamorphoses and often spread to enrich the lives of peoples in far distant lands.
                     That present-day societies represent a wide spectrum of such phenomena, therefore,
                     does not in any way define a fixed and immutable identity of the peoples concerned,
                     but merely distinguishes the stage through which given groups are—or at least until
                     recently have been—passing. Even so, all such cultural expressions are now in a state
                     of fluidity in consequence of the pressures of planetary integration.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <a id="024931981" class="brl-location"></a>A similar evolutionary process, Bahá’u’lláh indicates, has characterized the religious
                     life of humankind. The defining difference lies in the fact that, rather than representing
                     simply the accidents of history’s ongoing method of trial and error, such norms were
                     explicitly prescribed in each case, as integral features of one or another revelation
                     of the Divine, embodied in scripture, their integrity scrupulously maintained over
                     a period of centuries. While certain features of each code of conduct would eventually
                     fulfil their purpose and in time be overshadowed by concerns of a different nature
                     brought on by the process of social evolution, the code itself would lose none of
                     its authority during the long stage of human progress in which it played a vital role
                     in training behaviour and attitudes. “These principles and laws, these firmly-established
                     and mighty systems”, Bahá’u’lláh asserts, “have proceeded from one Source, and are
                     the rays of one Light. That they differ one from another is to be attributed to the
                     varying requirements of the ages in which they were promulgated.”<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#623820183">19</a></sup>

                     <a id="332909848" class="brl-location"></a>To argue, therefore, that differences of regulations, observances and other practices
                     constitute any significant objection to the idea of revealed religion’s essential
                     oneness is to miss the purpose that these prescriptions served. More seriously, it
                     misses the fundamental distinction between the eternal and the transitory features
                     of religion’s function. The essential message of religion is immutable. It is, in
                     Bahá’u’lláh’s words, “the changeless Faith of God, eternal in the past, eternal in
                     the future”.<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#403867181">20</a></sup> Its role in opening the way for the soul to enter into an evermore mature relationship
                     with its Creator—and in endowing it with an ever-greater measure of moral autonomy
                     in disciplining the animal impulses of human nature—is not at all irreconcilable with
                     its providing auxiliary guidance that enhances the process of civilization building.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <a id="152982700" class="brl-location"></a>The concept of progressive revelation places the ultimate emphasis on recognition
                     of the revelation of God at its appearance. The failure of the generality of humankind
                     in this respect has, time and again, condemned entire populations to a ritualistic
                     repetition of ordinances and practices long after these latter have fulfilled their
                     purpose and now merely stultify moral advance. Sadly, in the present day, a related
                     consequence of such failure has been to trivialize religion. At precisely the point
                     in its collective development where humanity began to struggle with the challenges
                     of modernity, the spiritual resource on which it had principally depended for moral
                     courage and enlightenment was fast becoming a subject of mockery, first at those levels
                     where decisions were being made about the direction society should take, and eventually
                     in ever-widening circles of the general population. There is little cause for surprise,
                     then, that this most devastating of the many betrayals of trust from which human confidence
                     has suffered should, in the course of time, undermine the foundations of belief itself.
                     So it is that Bahá’u’lláh repeatedly urges His readers to think deeply about the lesson
                     taught by such repeated failures: “Ponder for a moment, and reflect upon that which
                     has been the cause of such denial.…”<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#818864896">21</a></sup> “What could have been the reason for such denial and avoidance…?”<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#415089418">22</a></sup> “What could have caused such contention…?”<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#591825152">23</a></sup> “Reflect, what could have been the motive…?”<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#289755356">24</a></sup>

                     <a id="004298361" class="brl-location"></a>More detrimental still to religious understanding has been theological presumption.
                     A persistent feature of religion’s sectarian past has been the dominant role played
                     by clergy. In the absence of scriptural texts that established unarguable institutional
                     authority, clerical elites succeeded in arrogating to themselves exclusive control
                     over interpretation of the Divine intent. However diverse the motives, the tragic
                     effects have been to impede the current of inspiration, discourage independent intellectual
                     activity, focus attention on the minutiae of rituals and too often engender hatred
                     and prejudice towards those following a different sectarian path from that of self-appointed
                     spiritual leaders. While nothing could prevent the creative power of Divine intervention
                     from continuing its work of progressively raising consciousness, the scope of what
                     could be achieved, in any age, became increasingly limited by such artificially contrived
                     obstacles.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <a id="152851763" class="brl-location"></a>Over time, theology succeeded in constructing in the heart of each one of the great
                     faiths an authority parallel with, and even inimical in spirit to, the revealed teachings
                     on which the tradition was based. Jesus’ familiar parable of the landowner who sowed
                     seed in his field addresses both the issue and its implications for the present time:
                     “But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went his
                     way.”<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#064112809">25</a></sup> When his servants proposed to uproot them, the landowner replied, “Nay; lest while
                     ye gather up the tares, ye root up also the wheat with them. Let both grow together
                     until the harvest: and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye
                     together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat
                     into my barn.”<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#812687852">26</a></sup> Throughout its pages, the Qur’án reserves its severest condemnation for the spiritual
                     harm caused by this competing hegemony: “Say: The things that my Lord hath indeed
                     forbidden are: shameful deeds, whether open or secret; sins and trespasses against
                     truth or reason; assigning of partners to God, for which he hath given no authority;
                     and saying things about God of which ye have no knowledge.”<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#988583525">27</a></sup> To the modern mind it is the greatest of ironies that generations of theologians,
                     whose impositions on religion embody precisely the betrayal so strongly denounced
                     in these texts, should seek to use the warning itself as a weapon in suppressing protest
                     against their usurpation of Divine authority.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <a id="677427608" class="brl-location"></a>In effect, each new stage in the progressively unfolding revelation of spiritual truth
                     was frozen in time and in an array of literalistic images and interpretations, many
                     of them borrowed from cultures which were themselves morally exhausted. Whatever their
                     value at earlier stages in the evolution of consciousness, conceptions of physical
                     resurrection, a paradise of carnal delights, reincarnation, pantheistic prodigies,
                     and the like, today raise walls of separation and conflict in an age when the earth
                     has literally become one homeland and human beings must learn to see themselves as
                     its citizens. In this context one can appreciate the reasons for the vehemence of
                     Bahá’u’lláh’s warnings about the barriers that dogmatic theology creates in the path
                     of those seeking to understand the will of God: “O leaders of religion! Weigh not
                     the Book of God with such standards and sciences as are current amongst you, for the
                     Book itself is the unerring Balance established amongst men.”<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#411201749">28</a></sup> In His Tablet to Pope Pius IX, He advises the pontiff that God has in this day “stored
                     away … in the vessels of justice” whatever is enduring in religion and “cast into
                     fire that which befitteth it”.<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#740326597">29</a></sup>

                     <a id="806429686" class="brl-location"></a>Freed from the thickets with which theology has hedged religious understanding about,
                     the mind is able to explore familiar scriptural passages through the eyes of Bahá’u’lláh.
                     “Peerless is this Day,” He asserts, “for it is as the eye to past ages and centuries,
                     and as a light unto the darkness of the times.”<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#145551477">30</a></sup> The most striking observation that results from taking advantage of this perspective
                     is the unity of purpose and principle running throughout the Hebrew scriptures, the
                     Gospel and the Qur’án, particularly, although echoes can readily be discerned in the
                     scriptures of others among the world’s religions. Repeatedly, the same organizing
                     themes emerge from the matrix of precept, exhortation, narrative, symbolism and interpretation
                     in which they are set. Of these foundational truths, by far the most distinctive is
                     the progressive articulation and emphatic assertion of the oneness of God, Creator
                     of all existence whether of the phenomenal world or of those realms that transcend
                     it. “I am the Lord,” the Bible declares, “and there is none else, there is no God
                     beside me”,<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#283017725">31</a></sup> and the same conception underpins the later teachings of Christ and Muḥammad.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <a id="413394727" class="brl-location"></a>Humanity—focal point, inheritor and trustee of the world—exists to know its Creator
                     and to serve His purpose. In its highest expression, the innate human impulse to respond
                     takes the form of worship, a condition entailing wholehearted submission to a power
                     that is recognized as deserving of such homage. “Now unto the King eternal, immortal,
                     invisible, the only wise God, be honour and glory for ever and ever.”<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#027139609">32</a></sup> Inseparable from the spirit of reverence itself is its expression in service to the
                     Divine purpose for humankind. “Say: All bounties are in the hand of God: He granteth
                     them to whom He pleaseth: and God careth for all, and He knoweth all things.”<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#416195684">33</a></sup> Illumined by this understanding, the responsibilities of humanity are clear: “It
                     is not righteousness that ye turn your faces towards East or West”, the Qur’án states,
                     “but it is righteousness—to believe in God … to spend of your substance, out of love
                     for Him, for your kin, for orphans, for the needy, for the wayfarer, for those who
                     ask.…”<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#297654618">34</a></sup> “Ye are the salt of the earth”,<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#039758785">35</a></sup> Christ impresses on those who respond to His call. “Ye are the light of the world.”<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#527433241">36</a></sup> Summarizing a theme that recurs time and again throughout the Hebrew scriptures and
                     will subsequently reappear in the Gospel and the Qur’án, the prophet Micah asks, “…what
                     doth the Lord require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly
                     with thy God?”<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#332132352">37</a></sup>

                  <p>
                     <a id="895377333" class="brl-location"></a>There is equal agreement in these texts that the soul’s ability to attain to an understanding
                     of its Creator’s purpose is the product not merely of its own effort, but of interventions
                     of the Divine that open the way. The point was made with memorable clarity by Jesus:
                     “I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.”<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#698856572">38</a></sup> If one is not to see in this assertion merely a dogmatic challenge to other stages
                     of the one ongoing process of Divine guidance, it is obviously the expression of the
                     central truth of revealed religion: that access to the unknowable Reality that creates
                     and sustains existence is possible only through awakening to the illumination shed
                     from that Realm. One of the most cherished of the Qur’án’s surihs takes up the metaphor:
                     “God is the Light of the heavens and the earth.… Light upon Light! God doth guide
                     whom He will to His Light.”<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#021371723">39</a></sup> In the case of the Hebrew prophets, the Divine intermediary that was later to appear
                     in Christianity in the person of the Son of Man and in Islám as the Book of God assumed
                     the form of a binding Covenant established by the Creator with Abraham, Patriarch
                     and Prophet: “And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after
                     thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee, and
                     to thy seed after thee.”<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#058426075">40</a></sup>

                     <a id="570272617" class="brl-location"></a>The succession of revelations of the Divine also appears as an implicit—and usually
                     explicit—feature of all the major faiths. One of its earliest and clearest expressions
                     occurs in the Bhagavad-Gita: “I come, and go, and come. When Righteousness declines,
                     O Bharata! When Wickedness is strong, I rise, from age to age, and take visible shape,
                     and move a man with men, succouring the good, thrusting the evil back, and setting
                     Virtue on her seat again.”<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#844568952">41</a></sup> This ongoing drama constitutes the basic structure of the Bible, whose sequence of
                     books recounts the missions not only of Abraham and of Moses—“whom the Lord knew face
                     to face”<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#900750776">42</a></sup>—but of the line of lesser prophets who developed and consolidated the work that these
                     primary Authors of the process had set in motion. Similarly, no amount of contentious
                     and fantastical speculation about the precise nature of Jesus could succeed in separating
                     His mission from the transformative influence exerted on the course of civilization
                     by the work of Abraham and Moses. He Himself warns that it is not He Who will condemn
                     those who reject the message He bears, but Moses “in whom ye trust. For had ye believed
                     Moses, ye would have believed me: for he wrote of me. But if ye believe not his writings,
                     how shall ye believe my words?”<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#675977830">43</a></sup> With the revelation of the Qur’án, the theme of the succession of the Messengers
                     of God becomes central: “We believe in God, and the revelation given to us, and to
                     Abraham, Ismā‘īl, Isaac, Jacob … and that given to Moses and Jesus, and that given
                     to (all) Prophets from their Lord.…”<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#635565399">44</a></sup>

                     <a id="816343252" class="brl-location"></a>For a sympathetic and objective reader of such passages what emerges is a recognition
                     of the essential oneness of religion. So it is that the term “Islám” (literally “submission”
                     to God) designates not merely the particular dispensation of Providence inaugurated
                     by Muḥammad but, as the words of the Qur’án make unmistakably clear, religion itself.
                     While it is true to speak of the unity of all religions, understanding of the context
                     is vital. At the deepest level, as Bahá’u’lláh emphasizes, there is but one religion.
                     Religion is religion, as science is science. The one discerns and articulates the
                     values unfolding progressively through Divine revelation; the other is the instrumentality
                     through which the human mind explores and is able to exert its influence ever more
                     precisely over the phenomenal world. The one defines goals that serve the evolutionary
                     process; the other assists in their attainment. Together, they constitute the dual
                     knowledge system impelling the advance of civilization. Each is hailed by the Master
                     as an “effulgence of the Sun of Truth”.<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#671777454">45</a></sup>

                     <a id="238756440" class="brl-location"></a>It is, therefore, an inadequate recognition of the unique station of Moses, Buddha,
                     Zoroaster, Jesus, Muḥammad—or of the succession of Avatars who inspired the Hindu
                     scriptures—to depict their work as the founding of distinct religions. Rather are
                     they appreciated when acknowledged as the spiritual Educators of history, as the animating
                     forces in the rise of the civilizations through which consciousness has flowered:
                     “He was in the world,” the Gospel declares, “and the world was made by him.…”<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#555549616">46</a></sup> That their persons have been held in a reverence infinitely above those of any other
                     historical figures reflects the attempt to articulate otherwise inexpressible feelings
                     aroused in the hearts of unnumbered millions of people by the blessings their work
                     has conferred. In loving them humanity has progressively learned what it means to
                     love God. There is, realistically, no other way to do so. They are not honoured by
                     fumbling efforts to capture the essential mystery of their nature in dogmas invented
                     by human imagination; what honours them is the soul’s unconditioned surrender of its
                     will to the transformative influence they mediate.

                     <a id="441276498" class="brl-location"></a>Confusion about the role of religion in cultivating moral consciousness is equally
                     apparent in popular understanding of its contribution to the shaping of society. Perhaps
                     the most obvious example is the inferior social status most sacred texts assign to
                     women. While the resulting benefits enjoyed by men were no doubt a major factor in
                     consolidating such a conception, moral justification was unquestionably supplied by
                     people’s understanding of the intent of the scriptures themselves. With few exceptions,
                     these texts address themselves to men, assigning to women a supportive and subordinate
                     role in the life of both religion and society. Sadly, such understanding made it deplorably
                     easy to attach primary blame to women for failure in the disciplining of the sexual
                     impulse, a vital feature of moral advancement. In a modern frame of reference, attitudes
                     of this kind are readily recognized as prejudiced and unjust. At the stages of social
                     development at which all of the major faiths came into existence, scriptural guidance
                     sought primarily to civilize, to the extent possible, relationships resulting from
                     intractable historical circumstances. It needs little insight to appreciate that clinging
                     to primitive norms in the present day would defeat the very purpose of religion’s
                     patient cultivation of moral sense.

                     <a id="063811658" class="brl-location"></a>Comparable considerations have pertained in relations between societies. The long
                     and arduous preparation of the Hebrew people for the mission required of them is an
                     illustration of the complexity and stubborn character of the moral challenges involved.
                     In order that the spiritual capacities appealed to by the prophets might awaken and
                     flourish, the inducements offered by neighbouring idolatrous cultures had, at all
                     costs, to be resisted. Scriptural accounts of the condign punishments that befell
                     both rulers and subjects who violated the principle illustrated the importance attached
                     to it by the Divine purpose. A somewhat comparable issue arose in the struggle of
                     the newborn community founded by Muḥammad to survive attempts by pagan Arab tribes
                     to extinguish it—and in the barbaric cruelty and relentless spirit of vendetta animating
                     the attackers. No one familiar with the historical details will have difficulty in
                     understanding the severity of the Qur’án’s injunctions on the subject. While the monotheistic
                     beliefs of Jews and Christians were to be accorded respect, no compromise with idolatry
                     was permitted. In a relatively brief space of time, this draconian rule had succeeded
                     in unifying the tribes of the Arabian Peninsula and launching the newly forged community
                     on well over five centuries of moral, intellectual, cultural and economic achievement,
                     unmatched before or since in the speed and scope of its expansion. History tends to
                     be a stern judge. Ultimately, in its uncompromising perspective, the consequences
                     to those who would have blindly strangled such enterprises in the cradle will always
                     be set off against the benefits accruing to the world as a whole from the triumph
                     of the Bible’s vision of human possibilities and the advances made possible by the
                     genius of Islamic civilization.

                  <p>
                     <a id="831811514" class="brl-location"></a>Among the most contentious of such issues in understanding society’s evolution towards
                     spiritual maturity has been that of crime and punishment. While different in detail
                     and degree, the penalties prescribed by most sacred texts for acts of violence against
                     either the commonweal or the rights of other individuals tended to be harsh. Moreover,
                     they frequently extended to permitting retaliation against the offenders by the injured
                     parties or by members of their families. In the perspective of history, however, one
                     may reasonably ask what practical alternatives existed. In the absence not merely
                     of present-day programmes of behavioural modification, but even of recourse to such
                     coercive options as prisons and policing agencies, religion’s concern was to impress
                     indelibly on general consciousness the moral unacceptability—and practical costs—of
                     conduct whose effect would otherwise have been to demoralize efforts at social progress.
                     The whole of civilization has since been the beneficiary, and it would be less than
                     honest not to acknowledge the fact.

                  <p>
                     <a id="278094157" class="brl-location"></a>So it has been throughout all of the religious dispensations whose origins have survived
                     in written records. Mendicancy, slavery, autocracy, conquest, ethnic prejudices and
                     other undesirable features of social interaction have gone unchallenged—or been explicitly
                     indulged—as religion sought to achieve reformations of behaviour that were considered
                     more immediately essential at given stages in the advance of civilization. To condemn
                     religion because any one of its successive dispensations failed to address the whole
                     range of social wrongs would be to ignore everything that has been learned about the
                     nature of human development. Inevitably, anachronistic thinking of this kind must
                     also create severe psychological handicaps in appreciating and facing the requirements
                     of one’s own time.

                     <a id="799790541" class="brl-location"></a>The issue is not the past, but the implications for the present. Problems arise where
                     followers of one of the world’s faiths prove unable to distinguish between its eternal
                     and transitory features, and attempt to impose on society rules of behaviour that
                     have long since accomplished their purpose. The principle is fundamental to an understanding
                     of religion’s social role: “The remedy the world needeth in its present-day afflictions
                     can never be the same as that which a subsequent age may require”, Bahá’u’lláh points
                     out. “Be anxiously concerned with the needs of the age ye live in, and centre your
                     deliberations on its exigencies and requirements.”<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#150634943">47</a></sup>

                     <a id="752465628" class="brl-location"></a>The exigencies of the new age of human experience to which Bahá’u’lláh summoned the
                     political and religious rulers of the nineteenth century world have now been largely
                     adopted, at least as ideals, by their successors and by progressive minds everywhere.
                     By the time the twentieth century had drawn to a close, principles that had, only
                     short decades earlier, been patronized as visionary and hopelessly unrealistic had
                     become central to global discourse. Buttressed by the findings of scientific research
                     and the conclusions of influential commissions—often lavishly funded—they direct the
                     work of powerful agencies at international, national and local levels. A vast body
                     of scholarly literature in many languages is devoted to exploring practical means
                     for their implementation, and those programmes can count on media attention on five
                     continents.

                  <p>
                     <a id="198455761" class="brl-location"></a>Most of these principles are, alas, also widely flouted, not only among recognized
                     enemies of social peace, but in circles professedly committed to them. What is lacking
                     is not convincing testimony as to their relevance, but the power of moral conviction
                     that can implement them, a power whose only demonstrably reliable source throughout
                     history has been religious faith. As late as the inception of Bahá’u’lláh’s own mission,
                     religious authority still exercised a significant degree of social influence. When
                     the Christian world was moved to break with millennia of unquestioning conviction
                     and address at last the evil of slavery, it was to Biblical ideals that the early
                     British reformers sought to appeal. Subsequently, in the defining address he gave
                     regarding the central role played by the issue in the great conflict in America, the
                     president of the United States warned that if “every drop of blood drawn with the
                     lash shall be paid by another drawn with the sword, as was said three thousand years
                     ago, so still it must be said ‘the judgements of the Lord are true and righteous altogether’.”<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#439799306">48</a></sup> That era, however, was swiftly drawing to a close. In the upheavals that followed
                     the Second World War, even so influential a figure as Mohandas Gandhi proved unable
                     to mobilize the spiritual power of Hinduism in support of his efforts to extinguish
                     sectarian violence on the Indian subcontinent. Nor were leaders of the Islamic community
                     any more effective in this respect. As prefigured in the Qur’án’s metaphorical vision
                     of “The Day that We roll up the heavens like a scroll”,<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#503464551">49</a></sup> the once unchallengeable authority of the traditional religions had ceased to direct
                     humanity’s social relations.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <a id="306538055" class="brl-location"></a>It is in this context that one begins to appreciate Bahá’u’lláh’s choice of imagery
                     about the will of God for a new age: “Think not that We have revealed unto you a mere
                     code of laws. Nay, rather, We have unsealed the choice Wine with the fingers of might
                     and power.”<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#991688769">50</a></sup> Through His revelation, the principles required for the collective coming of age
                     of the human race have been invested with the one power capable of penetrating to
                     the roots of human motivation and of altering behaviour. For those who have recognized
                     Him, equality of men and women is not a sociological postulate, but revealed truth
                     about human nature, with implications for every aspect of human relations. The same
                     is true of His teaching of the principle of racial oneness. Universal education, freedom
                     of thought, the protection of human rights, recognition of the earth’s vast resources
                     as a trust for the whole of humankind, society’s responsibility for the well-being
                     of its citizenry, the promotion of scientific research, even so practical a principle
                     as an international auxiliary language that will advance integration of the earth’s
                     peoples—for all who respond to Bahá’u’lláh’s revelation, these and similar precepts
                     carry the same compelling authority as do the injunctions of scripture against idolatry,
                     theft and false witness. While intimations of some can be perceived in earlier sacred
                     writings, their definition and prescription had necessarily to wait until the planet’s
                     heterogeneous populations could set out together on the discovery of their nature
                     as a single human race. Through spiritual empowerment brought by Bahá’u’lláh’s revelation
                     the Divine standards can be appreciated, not as isolated principles and laws, but
                     as facets of a single, all-embracing vision of humanity’s future, revolutionary in
                     purpose, intoxicating in the possibilities it opens.

                     <a id="579381145" class="brl-location"></a>Integral to these teachings are principles that address the administration of humanity’s
                     collective affairs. A widely quoted passage in Bahá’u’lláh’s Tablet to Queen Victoria
                     expresses emphatic praise of the principle of democratic and constitutional government,
                     but is also an admonition about the context of global responsibility in which that
                     principle must operate if it is to realize its purpose in this age: “O ye the elected
                     representatives of the people in every land! Take ye counsel together, and let your
                     concern be only for that which profiteth mankind and bettereth the condition thereof,
                     if ye be of them that scan heedfully. Regard the world as the human body which, though
                     at its creation whole and perfect, hath been afflicted, through various causes, with
                     grave disorders and maladies. Not for one day did it gain ease, nay its sickness waxed
                     more severe, as it fell under the treatment of ignorant physicians, who gave full
                     rein to their personal desires and have erred grievously. And if, at one time, through
                     the care of an able physician, a member of that body was healed, the rest remained
                     afflicted as before.”<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#735351694">51</a></sup> In other passages, Bahá’u’lláh spells out some of the practical implications. The
                     governments of the world are called upon to convene an international consultative
                     body as the foundation, in the words of the Guardian, of “a world federal system”<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#965239923">52</a></sup> empowered to safeguard the autonomy and territory of its state members, resolve national
                     and regional disputes and coordinate programmes of global development for the good
                     of the entire human race. Significantly, Bahá’u’lláh attributes to this system, once
                     established, the right to suppress by force acts of aggression by one state against
                     another. Addressing the rulers of His day, He asserts the clear moral authority of
                     such action: “Should any one among you take up arms against another, rise ye all against
                     him, for this is naught but manifest justice.”<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#968665622">53</a></sup>

                     Although to Bahá’ís the most obvious of truths, its implications for the current crisis
                     of civilization appear to escape most contemporary discourse. Few will disagree that
                     the universal disease sapping the health of the body of humankind is that of disunity.
                     Its manifestations everywhere cripple political will, debilitate the collective urge
                     to change, and poison national and religious relationships. How strange, then, that
                     unity is regarded as a goal to be attained, if at all, in a distant future, after
                     a host of disorders in social, political, economic and moral life have been addressed
                     and somehow or other resolved. Yet the latter are essentially symptoms and side effects
                     of the problem, not its root cause. Why has so fundamental an inversion of reality
                     come to be widely accepted? The answer is presumably because the achievement of genuine
                     unity of mind and heart among peoples whose experiences are deeply at variance is
                     thought to be entirely beyond the capacity of society’s existing institutions. While
                     this tacit admission is a welcome advance over the understanding of processes of social
                     evolution that prevailed a few decades ago, it is of limited practical assistance
                     in responding to the challenge.

                     <a id="783078444" class="brl-location"></a>Unity is a condition of the human spirit. Education can support and enhance it, as
                     can legislation, but they can do so only once it emerges and has established itself
                     as a compelling force in social life. A global intelligentsia, its prescriptions largely
                     shaped by materialistic misconceptions of reality, clings tenaciously to the hope
                     that imaginative social engineering, supported by political compromise, may indefinitely
                     postpone the potential disasters that few deny loom over humanity’s future. “We can
                     well perceive how the whole human race is encompassed with great, with incalculable
                     afflictions”, Bahá’u’lláh states. “They that are intoxicated by self-conceit have
                     interposed themselves between it and the Divine and infallible Physician. Witness
                     how they have entangled all men, themselves included, in the mesh of their devices.
                     They can neither discover the cause of the disease, nor have they any knowledge of
                     the remedy.”<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#757817245">54</a></sup> As unity is the remedy for the world’s ills, its one certain source lies in the restoration
                     of religion’s influence in human affairs. The laws and principles revealed by God,
                     in this day, Bahá’u’lláh declares, “are the most potent instruments and the surest
                     of all means for the dawning of the light of unity amongst men.”<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#642295106">55</a></sup> “Whatsoever is raised on this foundation, the changes and chances of the world can
                     never impair its strength, nor will the revolution of countless centuries undermine
                     its structure.”<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#008497287">56</a></sup>

                     <a id="601769741" class="brl-location"></a>Central to Bahá’u’lláh’s mission, therefore, has been the creation of a global community
                     that would reflect the oneness of humankind. The ultimate testimony that the Bahá’í
                     community can summon in vindication of His mission is the example of unity that His
                     teachings have produced. As it enters the twenty-first century, the Bahá’í Cause is
                     a phenomenon unlike anything else the world has seen. After decades of effort, in
                     which surges of growth alternated with long stretches of consolidation, often shadowed
                     by setbacks, the Bahá’í community today comprises several million people representative
                     of virtually every ethnic, cultural, social and religious background on earth, administering
                     their collective affairs without the intervention of a clergy, through democratically
                     elected institutions. The many thousands of localities in which it has put down its
                     roots are to be found in every country, territory and significant island group, from
                     the Arctic to Tierra del Fuego, from Africa to the Pacific. The assertion that this
                     community may already constitute the most diverse and geographically widespread of
                     any similarly organized body of people on the planet is unlikely to be challenged
                     by one familiar with the evidence.

                     <a id="969956715" class="brl-location"></a>The achievement calls out for understanding. Conventional explanations—access to wealth,
                     the patronage of powerful political interests, invocations of the occult or aggressive
                     programmes of proselytism that instil fear of Divine wrath—none have played any role
                     in the events involved. Adherents of the Faith have achieved a sense of identity as
                     members of a single human race, an identity that shapes the purpose of their lives
                     and that, clearly, is not the expression of any intrinsic moral superiority on their
                     own part: “O people of Bahá! That there is none to rival you is a sign of mercy.”<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#112668876">57</a></sup> A fair-minded observer is compelled to entertain at least the possibility that the
                     phenomenon may represent the operation of influences entirely different in nature
                     from the familiar ones—influences that can properly be described only as spiritual—capable
                     of eliciting extraordinary feats of sacrifice and understanding from ordinary people
                     of every background.

                     <a id="016071242" class="brl-location"></a>Particularly striking has been the fact that the Bahá’í Cause has been able to maintain
                     the unity thus achieved, unbroken and unimpaired, through the most vulnerable early
                     stages of its existence. One will search in vain for another association of human
                     beings in history—political, religious, or social—that has successfully survived the
                     perennial blight of schism and faction. The Bahá’í community, in all its diversity,
                     is a single body of people, one in its understanding of the intent of the revelation
                     of God that gave it birth, one in its devotion to the Administrative Order that its
                     Author created for the governance of its collective affairs, one in its commitment
                     to the task of disseminating His message throughout the planet. Over the decades of
                     its rise, several individuals, some of them highly placed and all of them driven by
                     the spur of ambition, did their utmost to create separate followings loyal to themselves
                     or to the personal interpretations they had imposed on Bahá’u’lláh’s writings. At
                     earlier stages in the evolution of religion, similar attempts had proved successful
                     in splitting the newborn faiths into competing sects. In the case of the Bahá’í Cause,
                     however, such intrigues have failed, without exception, to produce more than transient
                     outbursts of controversy whose net effect has been to deepen the community’s understanding
                     of its Founder’s purpose and its commitment to it. “So powerful is the light of unity”,
                     Bahá’u’lláh assures those who recognize Him, “that it can illuminate the whole earth.”<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#062812396">58</a></sup> Human nature being what it is, one can readily appreciate the Guardian’s anticipation
                     that this purifying process will long continue—paradoxically but necessarily—to be
                     an integral feature of the maturation of the Bahá’í community.

                     <a id="020278994" class="brl-location"></a>A corollary of the abandonment of faith in God has been a paralysis of ability to
                     address effectively the problem of evil or, in many cases, even to acknowledge it.
                     While Bahá’ís do not attribute to the phenomenon the objective existence it was assumed
                     at earlier stages of religious history to possess, the negation of the good that evil
                     represents, as with darkness, ignorance or disease, is severely crippling in its effect.
                     Few publishing seasons pass that do not offer the educated reader a range of new and
                     imaginative analyses of the character of some of the monstrous figures who, during
                     the twentieth century, systematically tortured, degraded and exterminated millions
                     of their fellow human beings. One is invited by scholarly authority to ponder the
                     weight that should be given, variously, to paternal abuse, social rejection, professional
                     disappointments, poverty, injustice, war experiences, possible genetic impairment,
                     nihilistic literature—or various combinations of the foregoing—in seeking to understand
                     the obsessions fuelling an apparently bottomless hatred of humankind. Conspicuously
                     missing from such contemporary speculation is what experienced commentators, even
                     as recently as a century ago, would have recognized as spiritual disease, whatever
                     its accompanying features.

                     <a id="517561061" class="brl-location"></a>If unity is indeed the litmus test of human progress, neither history nor Heaven will
                     readily forgive those who choose deliberately to raise their hands against it. In
                     trusting, people lower their defences and open themselves to others. Without doing
                     so, there is no way in which they can commit themselves wholeheartedly to shared goals.
                     Nothing is so devastating as suddenly to discover that, for the other party, commitments
                     made in good faith have represented no more than an advantage gained, a means of achieving
                     concealed objectives different from, or even inimical to, what had ostensibly been
                     undertaken together. Such betrayal is a persistent thread in human history that found
                     one of its earliest recorded expressions in the ancient tale of Cain’s jealousy of
                     the brother whose faith God had chosen to confirm. If the appalling suffering endured
                     by the earth’s peoples during the twentieth century has left a lesson, it lies in
                     the fact that the systemic disunity, inherited from a dark past and poisoning relations
                     in every sphere of life, could throw open the door in this age to demonic behaviour
                     more bestial than anything the mind had dreamed possible.

                     of peace and reconciliation by which people of goodwill seek to escape the past and
                     to build together a new future. By its very nature, unity requires self-sacrifice.
                     “…self-love”, the Master states, “is kneaded into the very clay of man.”<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#319173069">59</a></sup> The ego, termed by Him the “insistent self”,<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#158274428">60</a></sup> resists instinctively constraints imposed on what it conceives to be its freedom.
                     To willingly forgo the satisfactions that licence affords, the individual must come
                     to believe that fulfilment lies elsewhere. Ultimately, it lies, as it has always done,
                     in the soul’s submission to God.

                     <a id="553176132" class="brl-location"></a>Failure to meet the challenge of such submission has manifested itself with especially
                     devastating consequences throughout the centuries in betrayal of the Messengers of
                     God and of the ideals they taught. This discussion is not the place for a review of
                     the nature and provisions of the specific Covenant by means of which Bahá’u’lláh has
                     successfully preserved the unity of those who recognize Him and serve His purpose.
                     It is sufficient to note the strength of the language He reserves for its deliberate
                     violation by those who simultaneously pretend allegiance to it: “They that have turned
                     away therefrom are reckoned among the inmates of the nethermost fire in the sight
                     of thy Lord, the Almighty, the Unconstrained.”<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#168729836">61</a></sup> The reason for the severity of this condemnation is obvious. Few people have difficulty
                     in recognizing the danger to social well-being of such familiar crimes as murder,
                     rape or fraud, nor the need for society to take effective measures of self-protection.
                     But how are Bahá’ís to think about a perversity which, if unchecked, would destroy
                     the very means essential to the creation of unity—would, in the uncompromising words
                     of the Master, “become even as an axe striking at the very root of the Blessed Tree”?<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#755649455">62</a></sup> The issue is not one of intellectual dissent, nor even of moral weakness. Many people
                     are resistant to accepting authority of one kind or another, and eventually distance
                     themselves from circumstances that require it. Persons who have been attracted to
                     the Bahá’í Faith but who decide, for whatever reason, to leave it are entirely free
                     to do so.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <a id="350178787" class="brl-location"></a>Covenant-breaking is a phenomenon fundamentally different in nature. The impulse it
                     arouses in those under its influence is not simply to pursue freely whatever path
                     they believe leads to personal fulfilment or contribution to society. Rather, are
                     such persons driven by an apparently ungovernable determination to impose their personal
                     will on the community by any means available to them, without regard for the damage
                     done and without respect for the solemn undertakings they entered into on being accepted
                     as members of that community. Ultimately, the self becomes the overriding authority,
                     not only in the individual’s own life, but in whatever other lives can be successfully
                     influenced. As long and tragic experience has demonstrated all too certainly, endowments
                     such as distinguished lineage, intellect, education, piety or social leadership can
                     be harnessed, equally, to the service of humanity or to that of personal ambition.
                     In ages past, when spiritual priorities of a different nature were the focus of the
                     Divine purpose, the consequences of such rebellion did not vitiate the central message
                     of any of the successive revelations of God. Today, with the immense opportunities
                     and horrific dangers that physical unification of the planet has brought with it,
                     commitment to the requirements of unity becomes the touchstone of all professions
                     of devotion to the will of God or, for that matter, to the well-being of humankind.

                     and work and find fulfilment as a single race, in a single global homeland.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <a id="865137230" class="brl-location"></a>This fact underlines, if further emphasis were needed, the urgency of the successive
                     Plans devised by the Universal House of Justice for the expansion and consolidation
                     of the Faith. The rest of humanity has every right to expect that a body of people
                     genuinely committed to the vision of unity embodied in the writings of Bahá’u’lláh
                     will be an increasingly vigorous contributor to programmes of social betterment that
                     depend for their success precisely on the force of unity. Responding to the expectation
                     will require the Bahá’í community to grow at an ever-accelerating pace, greatly multiplying
                     the human and material resources invested in its work and diversifying still further
                     the range of talents that equip it to be a useful partner with like-minded organizations.
                     Along with the social objectives of the effort must go an appreciation of the longing
                     of millions of equally sincere people, as yet unaware of Bahá’u’lláh’s mission but
                     inspired by many of its ideals, for an opportunity to find lives of service that will
                     have enduring meaning. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <a id="987028627" class="brl-location"></a>The culture of systematic growth taking root in the Bahá’í community would seem, therefore,
                     by far the most effective response the friends can make to the challenge discussed
                     in these pages. The experience of an intense and ongoing immersion in the Creative
                     Word progressively frees one from the grip of the materialistic assumptions—what Bahá’u’lláh
                     terms “the allusions of the embodiments of satanic fancy”<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#847629443">63</a></sup>—that pervade society and paralyze impulses for change. It develops in one a capacity
                     to assist the yearning for unity on the part of friends and acquaintances to find
                     mature and intelligent expression. The nature of the core activities of the current
                     Plan—children’s classes, devotional meetings and study circles—permits growing numbers
                     of persons who do not yet regard themselves as Bahá’ís to feel free to participate
                     in the process. The result has been to bring into existence what has been aptly termed
                     a “community of interest”. As others benefit from participation and come to identify
                     with the goals the Cause is pursuing, experience shows that they, too, are inclined
                     to commit themselves fully to Bahá’u’lláh as active agents of His purpose. Apart from
                     its associated objectives, therefore, wholehearted prosecution of the Plan has the
                     potentiality of amplifying enormously the Bahá’í community’s contribution to public
                     discourse on what has become the most demanding issue facing humankind.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <a id="295582579" class="brl-location"></a>If Bahá’ís are to fulfil Bahá’u’lláh’s mandate, however, it is obviously vital that
                     they come to appreciate that the parallel efforts of promoting the betterment of society
                     and of teaching the Bahá’í Faith are not activities competing for attention. Rather,
                     are they reciprocal features of one coherent global programme. Differences of approach
                     are determined chiefly by the differing needs and differing stages of inquiry that
                     the friends encounter. Because free will is an inherent endowment of the soul, each
                     person who is drawn to explore Bahá’u’lláh’s teachings will need to find his own place
                     in the never-ending continuum of spiritual search. He will need to determine, in the
                     privacy of his own conscience and without pressure, the spiritual responsibility this
                     discovery entails. In order to exercise this autonomy intelligently, however, he must
                     gain both a perspective on the processes of change in which he, like the rest of the
                     earth’s population, is caught up and a clear understanding of the implications for
                     his own life. The obligation of the Bahá’í community is to do everything in its power
                     to assist all stages of humanity’s universal movement towards reunion with God. The
                     Divine Plan bequeathed it by the Master is the means by which this work is carried
                     out.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <a id="728940595" class="brl-location"></a>However central the ideal of the oneness of religion unquestionably is, therefore,
                     the task of sharing Bahá’u’lláh’s message is obviously not an interfaith project.
                     While the mind seeks intellectual certainty, what the soul longs for is the attainment
                     of <span class="brl-italic">certitude</span>. Such inner conviction is the ultimate goal of all spiritual seeking, regardless
                     of how rapid or gradual the process may be. For the soul, the experience of conversion
                     is not an extraneous or incidental feature of the exploration of religious truth,
                     but the pivotal issue that must eventually be addressed. There is no ambiguity about
                     Bahá’u’lláh’s words on the subject and there can be none in the minds of those who
                     seek to serve Him: “Verily I say, this is the Day in which mankind can behold the
                     Face, and hear the Voice, of the Promised One. The Call of God hath been raised, and
                     the light of His countenance hath been lifted up upon men. It behoveth every man to
                     blot out the trace of every idle word from the tablet of his heart, and to gaze, with
                     an open and unbiased mind, on the signs of His Revelation, the proofs of His Mission,
                     and the tokens of His glory.”<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#091065327">64</a></sup>

                     <a id="947807024" class="brl-location"></a>One of the distinguishing features of modernity has been the universal awakening of
                     historical consciousness. An outcome of this revolutionary change in perspective that
                     greatly enhances the teaching of Bahá’u’lláh’s message is the ability of people, given
                     the chance, to recognize that the whole body of humanity’s sacred texts places the
                     drama of salvation itself squarely in the context of history. Beneath the surface
                     language of symbol and metaphor, religion, as the scriptures reveal it, operates not
                     through the arbitrary dictates of magic but as a process of fulfilment unfolding in
                     a physical world created by God for that purpose.

                     <a id="081117774" class="brl-location"></a>In this respect, the texts speak with one voice: religion’s goal is humanity’s attainment
                     of the age of “in-gathering”,<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#107193775">65</a></sup> of “one fold, and one shepherd”;<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#413214398">66</a></sup> the great age to come when “the Earth will shine with the glory of its Lord”<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#102600173">67</a></sup> and the will of God is carried out “in earth, as it is in heaven”;<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#129527594">68</a></sup> “the promised Day”<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#864462619">69</a></sup> when the “holy city”<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#799953477">70</a></sup> will descend “out of heaven, from … God”,<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#165889128">71</a></sup> when “the mountain of the Lord’s house shall be established in the top of the mountains,

                     or language as yet encompassed: “even as We produced the first Creation, so shall
                     We produce a new one: a promise We have undertaken: truly shall We fulfil it.”<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#983864201">76</a></sup>

                     <a id="262850450" class="brl-location"></a>The declared purpose of history’s series of prophetic revelations, therefore, has
                     been not only to guide the individual seeker on the path of personal salvation, but
                     to prepare the whole of the human family for the great eschatological Event lying
                     ahead, through which the life of the world will itself be entirely transformed. The
                     revelation of Bahá’u’lláh is neither preparatory nor prophetic. It <span class="brl-bold brl-italic">is</span> that Event. Through its influence, the stupendous enterprise of laying the foundations
                     of the Kingdom of God has been set in motion, and the population of the earth has
                     been endowed with the powers and capacities equal to the task. That Kingdom is a universal
                     civilization shaped by principles of social justice and enriched by achievements of
                     the human mind and spirit beyond anything the present age can conceive. “This is the
                     Day”, Bahá’u’lláh declares, “in which God’s most excellent favours have been poured
                     out upon men, the Day in which His most mighty grace hath been infused into all created
                     things.… Soon will the present-day order be rolled up, and a new one spread out in
                     its stead.”<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#231455598">77</a></sup>

                     <a id="236381095" class="brl-location"></a>Service to the goal calls for an understanding of the fundamental difference distinguishing
                     the mission of Bahá’u’lláh from political and ideological projects of human design.
                     The moral vacuum that produced the horrors of the twentieth century exposed the outermost
                     limits of the mind’s unaided capacity to devise and construct an ideal society, however
                     great the material resources harnessed to the effort. The suffering entailed has engraved
                     the lesson indelibly on the consciousness of the earth’s peoples. Religion’s perspective
                     on humanity’s future, therefore, has nothing in common with systems of the past—and
                     only relatively little relationship with those of today. Its appeal is to a reality
                     in the genetic code, if it can be so described, of the rational soul. The Kingdom
                     of Heaven, Jesus taught two thousand years ago, is “within”.<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#841878947">78</a></sup> His organic analogies of a “vineyard”,<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#359728163">79</a></sup> of “seed [sown] into the good ground”,<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#619555598">80</a></sup> of the “good tree [that] bringeth forth good fruit”<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#368874519">81</a></sup> speak of a potentiality of the human species that has been nurtured and trained by
                     God since the dawn of time as the purpose and leading edge of the creative process.
                     The ongoing work of patient cultivation is the task that Bahá’u’lláh has entrusted
                     to the company of those who recognize Him and embrace His Cause. Little wonder, then,
                     at the exalted language in which He speaks of a privilege so great: “Ye are the stars
                     of the heaven of understanding, the breeze that stirreth at the break of day, the
                     soft-flowing waters upon which must depend the very life of all men.…”<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#261718016">82</a></sup>

                     <a id="553862471" class="brl-location"></a>The process bears within itself the assurance of its fulfilment. For those with eyes
                     to see, the new creation is today everywhere emerging, in the same way that a seedling
                     becomes in time a fruit-bearing tree or a child reaches adulthood. Successive dispensations
                     of a loving and purposeful Creator have brought the earth’s inhabitants to the threshold
                     of their collective coming-of-age as a single people. Bahá’u’lláh is now summoning
                     humanity to enter on its inheritance: “That which the Lord hath ordained as the sovereign
                     remedy and mightiest instrument for the healing of all the world is the union of all
                     its peoples in one universal Cause, one common Faith.”<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#781371114">83</a></sup>
