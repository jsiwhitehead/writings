                     The letters which ye sent during the war were
                     not received, but a letter dated February 11th,
                     1916, has just come to hand, and immediately an
                     answer is being written. Your intention deserves
                     a thousand praises, because you are serving the
                     world of humanity, and this is conducive to the
                     happiness and welfare of all. This recent war
                     has proved to the world and the people that war
                     is destruction while universal peace is
                     construction; war is death while peace is life;
                     war is rapacity and bloodthirstiness while peace
                     is beneficence and humaneness; war is an
                     appurtenance of the world of nature while peace
                     is of the foundation of the religion of God; war
                     is darkness upon darkness while peace is
                     heavenly light; war is the destroyer of the
                     edifice of mankind while peace is the
                     everlasting life of the world of humanity; war
                     is like a devouring wolf while peace is like the
                     angels of heaven; war is the struggle for
                     existence while peace is mutual aid and
                     cooperation among the peoples of the world and
                     the cause of the good pleasure of the True One
                     in the heavenly realm.

                     There is not one soul whose conscience does not
                     testify that in this day there is no more
                     important matter in the world than that of
                     universal peace. Every just one bears witness to
                     this and adores that esteemed Assembly because
                     its aim is that this darkness may be changed
                     into light, this bloodthirstiness into kindness,
                     this torment into bliss, this hardship into ease
                     and this enmity and hatred into fellowship and
                     love. Therefore, the effort of those esteemed
                     souls is worthy of praise and commendation.
                     
                  </p>

                     But the wise souls who are aware of the
                     essential relationships emanating from the
                     realities of things consider that one single
                     matter cannot, by itself, influence the human
                     reality as it ought and should, for until the
                     minds of men become united, no important matter
                     can be accomplished. At present universal peace
                     is a matter of great importance, but unity of
                     conscience is essential, so that the foundation
                     of this matter may become secure, its
                     establishment firm and its edifice strong.
                     
                  </p>
                  <p class="">
                     <a id="726120427" class="brl-location"></a>
                     Therefore Bahá’u’lláh, fifty years ago,
                     expounded this question of universal peace at a
                     time when He was confined in the fortress of
                     ‘Akká and was wronged and imprisoned. He wrote
                     about this important matter of universal peace
                     to all the great sovereigns of the world, and
                     established it among His friends in the Orient.
                     The horizon of the East was in utter darkness,
                     nations displayed the utmost hatred and enmity
                     towards each other, religions thirsted for each
                     other’s blood, and it was darkness upon
                     darkness. At such a time Bahá’u’lláh shone forth
                     like the sun from the horizon of the east and
                     illumined Persia with the lights of these
                     teachings.
                     
                  </p>
                  <p class="">
                     <a id="237517291" class="brl-location"></a>
                     Among His teachings was the declaration of
                     universal peace. People of different nations,
                     religions and sects who followed Him came
                     together to such an extent that remarkable
                     gatherings were instituted consisting of the
                     various nations and religions of the East. Every
                     soul who entered these gatherings saw but one
                     nation, one teaching, one pathway, one order,
                     for the teachings of Bahá’u’lláh were not
                     limited to the establishment of universal peace.
                     They embraced many teachings which supplemented
                     and supported that of universal peace.
                     
                  </p>
                  <p class="">
                     <a id="238114283" class="brl-location"></a>
                     Among these teachings was the independent
                     investigation of reality so that the world of
                     humanity may be saved from the darkness of
                     imitation and attain to the truth; may tear off
                     and cast away this ragged and outgrown garment
                     of a thousand years ago and may put on the robe
                     woven in the utmost purity and holiness in the
                     loom of reality. As reality is one and cannot
                     admit of multiplicity, therefore different
                     opinions must ultimately become fused into one.
                     
                  </p>
                  <p class="">
                     <a id="935566827" class="brl-location"></a>
                     And among the teachings of Bahá’u’lláh is the
                     oneness of the world of humanity; that all human
                     beings are the sheep of God and He is the kind
                     Shepherd. This Shepherd is kind to all the
                     sheep, because He created them all, trained
                     them, provided for them and protected them.
                     There is no doubt that the Shepherd is kind to
                     all the sheep and should there be among these
                     sheep ignorant ones, they must be educated; if
                     there be children, they must be trained until
                     they reach maturity; if there be sick ones, they
                     must be cured. There must be no hatred and
                     enmity, for as by a kind physician these
                     ignorant, sick ones should be treated.
                     
                  </p>

                     And among the teachings of Bahá’u’lláh is that
                     religion must be the cause of fellowship and
                     love. If it becomes the cause of estrangement
                     then it is not needed, for religion is like a
                     remedy; if it aggravates the disease then it
                     becomes unnecessary.

                     And among the teachings of Bahá’u’lláh is that
                     religion must be in conformity with science and
                     reason, so that it may influence the hearts of
                     men. The foundation must be solid and must not
                     consist of imitations.

                     And among the teachings of Bahá’u’lláh is that
                     religious, racial, political, economic and
                     patriotic prejudices destroy the edifice of
                     humanity. As long as these prejudices prevail,
                     the world of humanity will not have rest. For a
                     period of 6,000 years history informs us about
                     the world of humanity. During these 6,000 years
                     the world of humanity has not been free from
                     war, strife, murder and bloodthirstiness. In
                     every period war has been waged in one country
                     or another and that war was due to either
                     religious prejudice, racial prejudice, political
                     prejudice or patriotic prejudice. It has
                     therefore been ascertained and proved that all
                     prejudices are destructive of the human edifice.
                     As long as these prejudices persist, the
                     struggle for existence must remain dominant, and
                     bloodthirstiness and rapacity continue.
                     Therefore, even as was the case in the past, the
                     world of humanity cannot be saved from the
                     darkness of nature and cannot attain
                     illumination except through the abandonment of
                     prejudices and the acquisition of the morals of
                     the Kingdom.

                     If this prejudice and enmity are on account of
                     religion consider that religion should be the
                     cause of fellowship, otherwise it is fruitless.
                     And if this prejudice be the prejudice of
                     nationality consider that all mankind are of one
                     nation; all have sprung from the tree of Adam,
                     and Adam is the root of the tree. That tree is
                     one and all these nations are like branches,
                     while the individuals of humanity are like
                     leaves, blossoms and fruits thereof. Then the
                     establishment of various nations and the
                     consequent shedding of blood and destruction of
                     the edifice of humanity result from human
                     ignorance and selfish motives.

                     As to the patriotic prejudice, this is also due
                     to absolute ignorance, for the surface of the
                     earth is one native land. Every one can live in
                     any spot on the terrestrial globe. Therefore all
                     the world is man’s birthplace. These boundaries
                     and outlets have been devised by man. In the
                     creation, such boundaries and outlets were not
                     assigned. Europe is one continent, Asia is one
                     continent, Africa is one continent, Australia is
                     one continent, but some of the souls, from
                     personal motives and selfish interests, have
                     divided each one of these continents and
                     considered a certain part as their own country.
                     God has set up no frontier between France and
                     Germany; they are continuous. Yet, in the first
                     centuries, selfish souls, for the promotion of
                     their own interests, have assigned boundaries
                     and outlets and have, day by day, attached more
                     importance to these, until this led to intense
                     enmity, bloodshed and rapacity in subsequent
                     centuries. In the same way this will continue
                     indefinitely, and if this conception of
                     patriotism remains limited within a certain
                     circle, it will be the primary cause of the
                     world’s destruction. No wise and just person
                     will acknowledge these imaginary distinctions.
                     Every limited area which we call our native
                     country we regard as our motherland, whereas the
                     terrestrial globe is the motherland of all, and
                     not any restricted area. In short, for a few
                     days we live on this earth and eventually we are
                     buried in it, it is our eternal tomb. Is it
                     worth while that we should engage in bloodshed
                     and tear one another to pieces for this eternal
                     tomb? Nay, far from it, neither is God pleased
                     with such conduct nor would any sane man approve
                     of it.

                     Consider! The blessed animals engage in no
                     patriotic quarrels. They are in the utmost
                     fellowship with one another and live together in
                     harmony. For example, if a dove from the east
                     and a dove from the west, a dove from the north
                     and a dove from the south chance to arrive, at
                     the same time, in one spot, they immediately
                     associate in harmony. So is it with all the
                     blessed animals and birds. But the ferocious
                     animals, as soon as they meet, attack and fight
                     with each other, tear each other to pieces and
                     it is impossible for them to live peaceably
                     together in one spot. They are all unsociable
                     and fierce, savage and combative fighters.

                     Regarding the economic prejudice, it is apparent
                     that whenever the ties between nations become
                     strengthened and the exchange of commodities
                     accelerated, and any economic principle is
                     established in one country, it will ultimately
                     affect the other countries and universal
                     benefits will result. Then why this prejudice?
                     
                  </p>

                     As to the political prejudice, the policy of God
                     must be followed and it is indisputable that the
                     policy of God is greater than human policy. We
                     must follow the Divine policy and that applies
                     alike to all individuals. He treats all
                     individuals alike: no distinction is made, and
                     that is the foundation of the Divine Religions.

                     And among the teachings of Bahá’u’lláh is the
                     origination of one language that may be spread
                     universally among the people. This teaching was
                     revealed from the pen of Bahá’u’lláh in order
                     that this universal language may eliminate
                     misunderstandings from among mankind.
                     
                  </p>

                     <a id="74886123" class="brl-location"></a>
                     And among the teachings of Bahá’u’lláh is the
                     equality of women and men. The world of humanity
                     has two wings—one is women and the other men.
                     Not until both wings are equally developed can
                     the bird fly. Should one wing remain weak,
                     flight is impossible. Not until the world of
                     women becomes equal to the world of men in the
                     acquisition of virtues and perfections, can
                     success and prosperity be attained as they ought
                     to be.
                     
                  </p>
                  <p class="">
                     <a id="5626348" class="brl-location"></a>
                     And among the teachings of Bahá’u’lláh is
                     voluntary sharing of one’s property with others
                     among mankind. This voluntary sharing is greater
                     than equality, and consists in this, that man
                     should not prefer himself to others, but rather
                     should sacrifice his life and property for
                     others. But this should not be introduced by
                     coercion so that it becomes a law and man is
                     compelled to follow it. Nay, rather, man should
                     voluntarily and of his own choice sacrifice his
                     property and life for others, and spend
                     willingly for the poor, just as is done in
                     Persia among the Bahá’ís.

                     <a id="52081132" class="brl-location"></a>
                     And among the teachings of Bahá’u’lláh is man’s
                     freedom, that through the ideal Power he should
                     be free and emancipated from the captivity of
                     the world of nature; for as long as man is
                     captive to nature he is a ferocious animal, as
                     the struggle for existence is one of the
                     exigencies of the world of nature. This matter
                     of the struggle for existence is the
                     fountain-head of all calamities and is the
                     supreme affliction.
                     
                  </p>

                     And among the teachings of Bahá’u’lláh is that
                     religion is a mighty bulwark. If the edifice of
                     religion shakes and totters, commotion and chaos
                     will ensue and the order of things will be
                     utterly upset, for in the world of mankind there
                     are two safeguards that protect man from
                     wrongdoing. One is the law which punishes the
                     criminal; but the law prevents only the manifest
                     crime and not the concealed sin; whereas the
                     ideal safeguard, namely, the religion of God,
                     prevents both the manifest and the concealed
                     crime, trains man, educates morals, compels the
                     adoption of virtues and is the all-inclusive
                     power which guarantees the felicity of the world
                     of mankind. But by religion is meant that which
                     is ascertained by investigation and not that
                     which is based on mere imitation, the
                     foundations of Divine Religions and not human
                     imitations.
                     
                  </p>
                  <p class="">
                     <a id="795650540" class="brl-location"></a>
                     And among the teachings of Bahá’u’lláh is that
                     although material civilization is one of the
                     means for the progress of the world of mankind,
                     yet until it becomes combined with Divine
                     civilization, the desired result, which is the
                     felicity of mankind, will not be attained.
                     Consider! These battleships that reduce a city
                     to ruins within the space of an hour are the
                     result of material civilization; likewise the
                     Krupp guns, the Mauser rifles, dynamite,
                     submarines, torpedo boats, armed aircraft and
                     bombers—all these weapons of war are the
                     malignant fruits of material civilization. Had
                     material civilization been combined with Divine
                     civilization, these fiery weapons would never
                     have been invented. Nay, rather, human energy
                     would have been wholly devoted to useful
                     inventions and would have been concentrated on
                     praiseworthy discoveries. Material civilization
                     is like a lamp-glass. Divine civilization is the
                     lamp itself and the glass without the light is
                     dark. Material civilization is like the body. No
                     matter how infinitely graceful, elegant and
                     beautiful it may be, it is dead. Divine
                     civilization is like the spirit, and the body
                     gets its life from the spirit, otherwise it
                     becomes a corpse. It has thus been made evident
                     that the world of mankind is in need of the
                     breaths of the Holy Spirit. Without the spirit
                     the world of mankind is lifeless, and without
                     this light the world of mankind is in utter
                     darkness. For the world of nature is an animal
                     world. Until man is born again from the world of
                     nature, that is to say, becomes detached from
                     the world of nature, he is essentially an
                     animal, and it is the teachings of God which
                     convert this animal into a human soul.
                     
                  </p>

                     And among the teachings of Bahá’u’lláh is the
                     promotion of education. Every child must be
                     instructed in sciences as much as is necessary.
                     If the parents are able to provide the expenses
                     of this education, it is well, otherwise the
                     community must provide the means for the
                     teaching of that child.

                     And among the teachings of Bahá’u’lláh are
                     justice and right. Until these are realized on
                     the plane of existence, all things shall be in
                     disorder and remain imperfect. The world of
                     mankind is a world of oppression and cruelty,
                     and a realm of aggression and error.

                     In fine, such teachings are numerous. These
                     manifold principles, which constitute the
                     greatest basis for the felicity of mankind and
                     are of the bounties of the Merciful, must be
                     added to the matter of universal peace and
                     combined with it, so that results may accrue.
                     Otherwise the realization of universal peace by
                     itself in the world of mankind is difficult. As
                     the teachings of Bahá’u’lláh are combined with
                     universal peace, they are like a table provided
                     with every kind of fresh and delicious food.
                     Every soul can find, at that table of infinite
                     bounty, that which he desires. If the question
                     is restricted to universal peace alone, the
                     remarkable results which are expected and
                     desired will not be attained. The scope of
                     universal peace must be such that all the
                     communities and religions may find their highest
                     wish realized in it. The teachings of
                     Bahá’u’lláh are such that all the communities of
                     the world, whether religious, political or
                     ethical, ancient or modern, find in them the
                     expression of their highest wish.

                     For example, the people of religions find, in
                     the teachings of Bahá’u’lláh, the establishment
                     of Universal Religion—a religion that perfectly
                     conforms with present conditions, which in
                     reality effects the immediate cure of the
                     incurable disease, which relieves every pain,
                     and bestows the infallible antidote for every
                     deadly poison. For if we wish to arrange and
                     organize the world of mankind in accordance with
                     the present religious imitations and thereby to
                     establish the felicity of the world of mankind,
                     it is impossible and impracticable—for example,
                     the enforcement of the laws of the Torah and
                     also of the other religions in accordance with
                     present imitations. But the essential basis of
                     all the Divine Religions which pertains to the
                     virtues of the world of mankind and is the
                     foundation of the welfare of the world of man,
                     is found in the teachings of Bahá’u’lláh in the
                     most perfect presentation.

                     Similarly, with regard to the peoples who
                     clamour for freedom: the moderate freedom which
                     guarantees the welfare of the world of mankind
                     and maintains and preserves the universal
                     relationships, is found in its fullest power and
                     extension in the teachings of Bahá’u’lláh.

                     So with regard to political parties: that which
                     is the greatest policy directing the world of
                     mankind, nay, rather, the Divine policy, is
                     found in the teachings of Bahá’u’lláh.

                     Likewise with regard to the party of “equality”
                     which seeks the solution of the economic
                     problems: until now all proposed solutions have
                     proved impracticable except the economic
                     proposals in the teachings of Bahá’u’lláh which
                     are practicable and cause no distress to
                     society.

                     So with the other parties: when ye look deeply
                     into this matter, ye will discover that the
                     highest aims of those parties are found in the
                     teachings of Bahá’u’lláh. These teachings
                     constitute the all-inclusive power among all men
                     and are practicable. But there are some
                     teachings of the past, such as those of the
                     Torah, which cannot be carried out at the
                     present day. It is the same with the other
                     religions and the tenets of the various sects
                     and the different parties.
                     
                  </p>

                     <a id="168313836" class="brl-location"></a>
                     For example, the question of universal peace,
                     about which Bahá’u’lláh says that the Supreme
                     Tribunal must be established: although the
                     League of Nations has been brought into
                     existence, yet it is incapable of establishing
                     universal peace. But the Supreme Tribunal which
                     Bahá’u’lláh has described will fulfil this
                     sacred task with the utmost might and power. And
                     His plan is this: that the national assemblies
                     of each country and nation—that is to say
                     parliaments—should elect two or three persons
                     who are the choicest of that nation, and are
                     well informed concerning international laws and
                     the relations between governments and aware of
                     the essential needs of the world of humanity in
                     this day. The number of these representatives
                     should be in proportion to the number of
                     inhabitants of that country. The election of
                     these souls who are chosen by the national
                     assembly, that is, the parliament, must be
                     confirmed by the upper house, the congress and
                     the cabinet and also by the president or monarch
                     so these persons may be the elected ones of all
                     the nation and the government. The Supreme
                     Tribunal will be composed of these people, and
                     all mankind will thus have a share therein, for
                     every one of these delegates is fully
                     representative of his nation. When the Supreme
                     Tribunal gives a ruling on any international
                     question, either unanimously or by majority
                     rule, there will no longer be any pretext for
                     the plaintiff or ground of objection for the
                     defendant. In case any of the governments or
                     nations, in the execution of the irrefutable
                     decision of the Supreme Tribunal, be negligent
                     or dilatory, the rest of the nations will rise
                     up against it, because all the governments and
                     nations of the world are the supporters of this
                     Supreme Tribunal. Consider what a firm
                     foundation this is! But by a limited and
                     restricted League the purpose will not be
                     realized as it ought and should. This is the
                     truth about the situation, which has been
                     stated.<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#866036717">2</a></sup>

                     Consider how powerful are the teachings of
                     Bahá’u’lláh. At a time when He was in the prison
                     of ‘Akká and was under the restrictions and
                     threats of two bloodthirsty kings, His
                     teachings, notwithstanding this fact, spread
                     with all power in Persia and other countries.
                     Should any teaching, or any principle, or any
                     community fall under the threat of a powerful
                     and bloodthirsty monarch, it would be
                     annihilated within a short space of time. At
                     present and for fifty years the Bahá’ís in
                     Persia and most regions have been under severe
                     restrictions and the threat of sword and spear.
                     Thousands of souls have given their lives in the
                     arena of sacrifice and have fallen as victims
                     under the swords of oppression and cruelty.
                     Thousands of esteemed families have been
                     uprooted and destroyed. Thousands of children
                     have been made fatherless. Thousands of fathers
                     have been bereft of their sons. Thousands of
                     mothers have wept and lamented for their boys
                     who have been beheaded. All this oppression and
                     cruelty, rapacity and bloodthirstiness did not
                     hinder or prevent the spread of the teachings of
                     Bahá’u’lláh. They spread more and more every
                     day, and their power and might became more
                     evident.

                     It may be that some foolish person among the
                     Persians will affix his name to the contents of
                     the Tablets of Bahá’u’lláh or to the
                     explanations given in the letters of
                     ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and send it to that esteemed
                     Assembly. Ye must be aware of this fact, for any
                     Persian who seeks fame or has some other
                     intention will take the entire contents of the
                     Tablets of Bahá’u’lláh and publish them in his
                     own name or in that of his community, just as
                     happened at the Universal Races Congress in
                     London before the war. A Persian took the
                     substance of the Epistles of Bahá’u’lláh,
                     entered that Congress, gave them forth in his
                     own name and published them, whereas the wording
                     was exactly that of Bahá’u’lláh. Some such souls
                     have gone to Europe and have caused confusion in
                     the minds of the people of Europe and have
                     disturbed the thoughts of some Orientalists. Ye
                     must bear this fact in mind, for not a word of
                     these teachings was heard in Persia before the
                     appearance of Bahá’u’lláh. Investigate this
                     matter so that it may become to you evident and
                     manifest. Some souls are like parrots. They
                     learn any note which they may hear, and sing it,
                     but they themselves are unaware of what they
                     utter. There is a sect in Persia at present made
                     up of a few souls who are called Bábís, who
                     claim to be followers of the Báb, whereas they
                     are utterly unaware of Him. They have some
                     secret teachings which are entirely opposed to
                     the teachings of Bahá’u’lláh and in Persia
                     people know this. But when these souls come to
                     Europe, they conceal their own teachings and
                     utter those of Bahá’u’lláh, for they know that
                     the teachings of Bahá’u’lláh are powerful and
                     they therefore declare publicly those teachings
                     of Bahá’u’lláh in their own name. As to their
                     secret teachings, they say that they are taken
                     from the Bayán and the Bayán is from the Báb.
                     When ye obtain the translation of the Bayán,
                     which has been translated in Persia, ye will
                     discover the truth that the teachings of
                     Bahá’u’lláh are utterly opposed to the teachings
                     of this sect. Beware lest ye disregard this
                     fact. Should ye desire to investigate the matter
                     further, enquire from Persia.

                     In brief, when you traverse the regions of the
                     world, thou shalt conclude that all progress is
                     the result of association and co-operation,
                     while ruin is the outcome of animosity and
                     hatred. Notwithstanding this, the world of
                     humanity does not take warning, nor does it
                     awake from the slumber of heedlessness. Man is
                     still causing differences, quarrels and strife
                     in order to marshal the cohorts of war and, with
                     his legions, rush into the field of bloodshed
                     and slaughter.

                     Then again, consider the phenomenon of
                     composition and decomposition, of existence and
                     non-existence. Every created thing in the
                     contingent world is made up of many and varied
                     atoms, and its existence is dependent on the
                     composition of these. In other words, a
                     conjunction of simple elements takes place so
                     that from this composition a distinct organism
                     is produced. The existence of all things is
                     based upon this principle. But when the order is
                     deranged, decomposition is produced and
                     disintegration sets in, then that thing ceases
                     to exist. That is, the annihilation of all
                     things is caused by decomposition and
                     disintegration. Therefore attraction and
                     composition between the various elements is the
                     means of life, and discord, and division produce
                     death. Thus the cohesive and attractive forces
                     in all things lead to the appearance of fruitful
                     results and effects, while estrangement and
                     alienation of things lead to disturbance and
                     annihilation. Through affinity and attraction
                     all living things like plants, animals and men
                     come into existence, while division and discord
                     bring about decomposition and destruction.

                     Consequently, that which is conducive to
                     association and attraction and unity among the
                     sons of men is the means of the life of the
                     world of humanity, and whatever causes division,
                     repulsion and remoteness leads to the death of
                     humankind.

                     And if, as you pass by fields and plantations,
                     where the plants, flowers and sweet-smelling
                     herbs are growing luxuriantly together, forming
                     a pattern of unity, this is an evidence of the
                     fact that that plantation and garden is
                     flourishing under the care of a skilful
                     gardener. But when you see it in a state of
                     disorder and irregularity you infer that it has
                     lacked the training of an efficient farmer and
                     thus has produced weeds and tares.

                     It therefore becomes manifest that amity and
                     cohesion are indicative of the training of the
                     Real Educator, and dispersion and separation a
                     proof of savagery and deprivation of divine
                     education.

                     A critic may object, saying that peoples, races,
                     tribes and communities of the world are of
                     different and varied customs, habits, tastes,
                     character, inclinations and ideas, that opinions
                     and thoughts are contrary to one another, and
                     how, therefore, is it possible for real unity to
                     be revealed and perfect accord among human souls
                     to exist?

                     In answer we say that differences are of two
                     kinds. One is the cause of annihilation and is
                     like the antipathy existing among warring
                     nations and conflicting tribes who seek each
                     other’s destruction, uprooting one another’s
                     families, depriving one another of rest and
                     comfort and unleashing carnage, and this is
                     blameworthy. The other kind which is a token of
                     diversity is the essence of perfection and the
                     cause of the appearance of divine bestowals.

                     Consider the flowers of a garden: though
                     differing in kind, colour, form and shape, yet,
                     inasmuch as they are refreshed by the waters of
                     one spring, revived by the breath of one wind,
                     invigorated by the rays of one sun, this
                     diversity increases their charm, and adds unto
                     their beauty. Thus when that unifying force, the
                     penetrating influence of the Word of God, takes
                     effect, the difference of customs, manners,
                     habits, ideas, opinions and dispositions
                     embellishes the world of humanity, and this is
                     praiseworthy. This diversity, this difference is
                     like the naturally created dissimilarity and
                     variety of the limbs and organs of the human
                     body, for each one contributes to the beauty,
                     efficiency and perfection of the whole. When
                     these different limbs and organs come under the
                     influence of man’s sovereign soul, and the
                     soul’s power pervades the limbs and members,
                     veins and arteries of the body, then difference
                     reinforces harmony, diversity strengthens love,
                     and multiplicity is the greatest factor for
                     co-ordination.

                     How unpleasing to the eye if all the flowers and
                     plants, the leaves and blossoms, the fruits, the
                     branches and the trees of that garden were all
                     of the same shape and colour! Diversity of hues,
                     form and shape, enriches and adorns the garden,
                     and heightens the effect thereof. In like
                     manner, when divers shades of thought,
                     temperament and character, are brought together
                     under the power and influence of one central
                     agency, the beauty and glory of human perfection
                     will be revealed and made manifest. Naught but
                     the celestial potency of the Word of God, which
                     rules and transcends the realities of all
                     things, is capable of harmonizing the divergent
                     thoughts, sentiments, ideas, and convictions of
                     the children of men. Verily, it is the
                     penetrating power in all things, the mover of
                     souls and the binder and regulator in the world
                     of humanity.

                     Some time ago, during the war, a letter was

                     risen to illumine the whole earth, and to
                     spiritualize the community of man. Laudable are
                     the results and the fruits thereof, abundant the
                     holy evidences deriving from this grace. This is
                     mercy unalloyed and purest bounty; it is light
                     for the world and all its peoples; it is harmony
                     and fellowship, and love and solidarity; indeed
                     it is compassion and unity, and the end of
                     foreignness; it is the being at one, in complete
                     dignity and freedom, with all on earth.

                     The Blessed Beauty saith: “Ye are all the fruits
                     of one tree, the leaves of one branch.” Thus
                     hath He likened this world of being to a single
                     tree, and all its peoples to the leaves thereof,
                     and the blossoms and fruits. It is needful for
                     the bough to blossom, and leaf and fruit to
                     flourish, and upon the interconnection of all
                     parts of the world-tree, dependeth the
                     flourishing of leaf and blossom, and the
                     sweetness of the fruit.

                     For this reason must all human beings powerfully
                     sustain one another and seek for everlasting
                     life; and for this reason must the lovers of God
                     in this contingent world become the mercies and
                     the blessings sent forth by that clement King of
                     the seen and unseen realms. Let them purify
                     their sight and behold all humankind as leaves
                     and blossoms and fruits of the tree of being.
                     Let them at all times concern themselves with
                     doing a kindly thing for one of their fellows,
                     offering to someone love, consideration,
                     thoughtful help. Let them see no one as their
                     enemy, or as wishing them ill, but think of all
                     humankind as their friends; regarding the alien
                     as an intimate, the stranger as a companion,
                     staying free of prejudice, drawing no lines.

                     In this day, the one favoured at the Threshold
                     of the Lord is he who handeth round the cup of
                     faithfulness; who bestoweth, even upon his
                     enemies, the jewel of bounty, and lendeth, even
                     to his fallen oppressor, a helping hand; it is
                     he who will, even to the fiercest of his foes,

                     O ye dear friends! The world is at war and the
                     human race is in travail and mortal combat. The
                     dark night of hate hath taken over, and the
                     light of good faith is blotted out. The peoples
                     and kindreds of the earth have sharpened their
                     claws, and are hurling themselves one against
                     the other. It is the very foundation of the
                     human race that is being destroyed. It is
                     thousands of households that are vagrant and
                     dispossessed, and every year seeth thousands
                     upon thousands of human beings weltering in
                     their lifeblood on dusty battlefields. The tents
                     of life and joy are down. The generals practice
                     their generalship, boasting of the blood they
                     shed, competing one with the next in inciting to
                     violence. “With this sword,” saith one of them,
                     “I beheaded a people!” And another: “I toppled a
                     nation to the ground!” And yet another: “I
                     brought a government down!” On such things do
                     men pride themselves, in such do they glory!
                     Love—righteousness—these are everywhere
                     censured, while despised are harmony, and
                     devotion to the truth.

                     The Faith of the Blessed Beauty is summoning
                     mankind to safety and love, to amity and peace;
                     it hath raised up its tabernacle on the heights
                     of the earth, and directeth its call to all
                     nations. Wherefore, O ye who are God’s lovers,
                     know ye the value of this precious Faith, obey
                     its teachings, walk in this road that is drawn
                     straight, and show ye this way to the people.
                     Lift up your voices and sing out the song of the
                     Kingdom. Spread far and wide the precepts and
                     counsels of the loving Lord, so that this world
                     will change into another world, and this
                     darksome earth will be flooded with light, and
                     the dead body of mankind will arise and live; so
                     that every soul will ask for immortality,
                     through the holy breaths of God.

                     Soon will your swiftly passing days be over, and
                     the fame and riches, the comforts, the joys
                     provided by this rubbish-heap, the world, will
                     be gone without a trace. Summon ye, then, the
                     people to God, and invite humanity to follow the
                     example of the Company on high. Be ye loving
                     fathers to the orphan, and a refuge to the
                     helpless, and a treasury for the poor, and a
                     cure for the ailing. Be ye the helpers of every
                     victim of oppression, the patrons of the
                     disadvantaged. Think ye at all times of
                     rendering some service to every member of the
                     human race. Pay ye no heed to aversion and
                     rejection, to disdain, hostility, injustice: act
                     ye in the opposite way. Be ye sincerely kind,
                     not in appearance only. Let each one of God’s
                     loved ones centre his attention on this: to be
                     the Lord’s mercy to man; to be the Lord’s grace.
                     Let him do some good to every person whose path
                     he crosseth, and be of some benefit to him. Let
                     him improve the character of each and all, and
                     reorient the minds of men. In this way, the
                     light of divine guidance will shine forth, and
                     the blessings of God will cradle all mankind:
                     for love is light, no matter in what abode it
                     dwelleth; and hate is darkness, no matter where
                     it may make its nest. O friends of God! That the
                     hidden Mystery may stand revealed, and the
                     secret essence of all things may be disclosed,
                     strive ye to banish that darkness for ever and
                     ever.

                     Your reply, dated 12 June 1920, to my letter was
                     received with the utmost gratitude. God be
                     praised, it testified to the unity of thought
                     and purpose that existeth between us and you,

                     We Bahá’ís have the greatest affinity for your
                     esteemed organization, and dispatched therefore
                     two distinguished individuals to you in order to
                     forge a strong bond. For in this day the cause
                     of universal peace is of paramount importance
                     amongst all human affairs and is the greatest
                     instrument for securing the very life and
                     felicity of mankind. Bereft of this effulgent
                     reality, humanity can in no wise find true
                     composure or real advancement but will, day by
                     day, sink ever deeper into misery and
                     wretchedness.

                     This last terrible war hath clearly proven that
                     humanity cannot withstand the effects of modern
                     instruments of warfare. The future can in no
                     wise be compared to the past, for earlier
                     weapons and armaments had but a feeble effect,
                     whilst modern ones can, in a brief span of time,
                     strike at the very roots of the world of
                     humanity and surpass the limits of its
                     endurance.

                     In this age, therefore, universal peace is like
                     unto the sun, which bestoweth life upon all
                     things, and it is thus incumbent upon all to
                     endeavour in the path of this mighty cause. Now,
                     we indeed share this common goal with you and
                     strive toward it with all our strength,
                     renouncing even our lives, our kindred, and our
                     substance for its sake.

                     As ye have no doubt heard, in Persia thousands
                     of souls have offered up their lives in this
                     path, and thousands of homes have been laid
                     waste. Despite this, we have in no wise
                     relented, but have continued to endeavour unto
                     this very moment and are increasing our efforts
                     as day followeth day, because our desire for
                     peace is not derived merely from the intellect:
                     It is a matter of religious belief and one of
                     the eternal foundations of the Faith of God.
                     That is why we strive with all our might and,
                     forsaking our own advantage, rest, and comfort,
                     forgo the pursuit of our own affairs; devote
                     ourselves to the mighty cause of peace; and
                     consider it to be the very foundation of the
                     Divine religions, a service to His Kingdom, the
                     source of eternal life, and the greatest means
                     of admittance into the heavenly realm.

                     Today the benefits of universal peace are
                     recognized amongst the people, and likewise the
                     harmful effects of war are clear and manifest to
                     all. But in this matter, knowledge alone is far
                     from sufficient: A power of implementation is
                     needed to establish it throughout the world. Ye
                     should therefore consider how the compelling
                     power of conscience can be awakened, so that
                     this lofty ideal may be translated from the
                     realm of thought into that of reality. For it is
                     clear and evident that the execution of this
                     mighty endeavour is impossible through ordinary
                     human feelings but requireth the powerful
                     sentiments of the heart to transform its
                     potential into reality.
                     
                  </p>

                     Indeed, all on earth know that an upright
                     character is praiseworthy and acceptable and
                     that baseness of character is blameworthy and
                     rejected, that justice and fairness are favoured
                     and agreeable whilst cruelty and tyranny are
                     unacceptable and rejected. Notwithstanding this,
                     all people, but for a few, are devoid of a
                     praiseworthy character and bereft of a sense of
                     justice.
                     
                  </p>

                     The power of conscience is therefore needed, and
                     spiritual sentiments are required, that souls
                     may feel compelled to evince a goodly character.
                     It is our firm belief that the power of
                     implementation in this great endeavour is the
                     penetrating influence of the Word of God and the
                     confirmations of the Holy Spirit.

                     midmost heart of the world and the banner of
                     universal peace unfurled in all regions. The
                     oneness of humanity must therefore be
                     established, that the edifice of universal peace
                     may be raised in turn.
