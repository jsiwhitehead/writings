                        His holy seat. Thereupon the voices of all created things, and beyond them those of
                        the Concourse on High, were heard calling aloud: “Haste thee, O Carmel, for lo, the
                        light of the countenance of God, the Ruler of the Kingdom of Names and Fashioner of
                        the heavens, hath been lifted upon thee.”

                        bestowed upon me Thy bounty, and hast directed towards me Thy steps. Separation from
                        Thee, O Thou Source of everlasting life, hath well nigh consumed me, and my remoteness
                        from Thy presence hath burned away my soul. All praise be to Thee for having enabled
                        me to hearken to Thy call, for having honored me with Thy footsteps, and for having
                        quickened my soul through the vitalizing fragrance of Thy Day and the shrilling voice
                        of Thy Pen, a voice Thou didst ordain as Thy trumpet-call amidst Thy people. And when
                        the hour at which Thy resistless Faith was to be made manifest did strike, Thou didst
                        breathe a breath of Thy spirit into Thy Pen, and lo, the entire creation shook to
                        its very foundations, unveiling to mankind  such mysteries as lay hidden within the
                        treasuries of Him Who is the Possessor of all created things.”

                        thee, when the ocean of My presence surged before thy face, cheering thine eyes and
                        those of all creation, and filling with delight all things visible and invisible.
                        Rejoice, for God hath in this Day established upon thee His throne, hath made thee
                        the dawning-place of His signs and the dayspring of the evidences of His Revelation.
                        Well is it with him that circleth around thee, that proclaimeth the revelation of
                        thy glory, and recounteth that which the bounty of the Lord thy God hath showered
                        upon thee. Seize thou the Chalice of Immortality in the name of thy Lord, the All-Glorious,
                        and give thanks unto Him, inasmuch as He, in token of His mercy unto thee, hath turned
                        thy sorrow into gladness, and transmuted thy grief into blissful joy. He, verily,
                        loveth the spot which hath been made the seat of His throne, which His footsteps have
                        trodden, which hath been honored by His presence, from which He raised His call, and
                        upon which He shed His tears.

                        the earth, and to carry to each one of its cities, the glad-tidings  of this Revelation—a
                        Revelation to which the heart of Sinai hath been attracted, and in whose name the
                        Burning Bush is calling: ‘Unto God, the Lord of Lords, belong the kingdoms of earth
                        and heaven.’ Verily this is the Day in which both land and sea rejoice at this announcement,
                        the Day for which have been laid up those things which God, through a bounty beyond
                        the ken of mortal mind or heart, hath destined for revelation. Ere long will God sail
                        His Ark upon thee, and will manifest the people of Bahá who have been mentioned in
                        the Book of Names.”

                        in your hearts? Day and night ye have been calling upon your Lord, the Omnipotent,
                        but when He came from the heaven of eternity in His great glory, ye turned aside from
                        Him and remained sunk in heedlessness.

                        <a id="289651333" class="brl-location"></a>Consider those who rejected the Spirit<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#015449147">3</a></sup> when He came unto them with manifest dominion. How numerous the Pharisees who had
                        secluded themselves in synagogues in His name, lamenting over their separation from
                        Him, and yet when the portals of reunion were flung open and the divine Luminary shone
                        resplendent from the Dayspring of Beauty, they disbelieved in God, the Exalted, the
                        Mighty. They failed to attain His presence, notwithstanding that  His advent had been
                        promised them in the Book of Isaiah as well as in the Books of the Prophets and the
                        Messengers. No one from among them turned his face towards the Dayspring of divine
                        bounty except such as were destitute of any power amongst men. And yet, today, every
                        man endowed with power and invested with sovereignty prideth himself on His Name.
                        Moreover, call thou to mind the one who sentenced Jesus to death. He was the most
                        learned of his age in his own country, whilst he who was only a fisherman believed
                        in Him. Take good heed and be of them that observe the warning.

                        in their churches, calling upon the Spirit, but when He appeared through the power
                        of Truth, they failed to draw nigh unto Him and are numbered with those that have
                        gone far astray. Happy are they that have abandoned them and set their faces towards
                        Him Who is the Desire of all that are in the heavens and all that are on the earth.

                        for your salvation. Flee ye the One Who hath sacrificed His life that ye may be quickened?
                        Fear God, O followers of the Spirit, and walk not in the footsteps of every divine
                        that hath gone far astray. Do ye imagine that He seeketh His own interests, when He
                        hath, at all times, been threatened by the swords of the enemies; or that He seeketh
                        the vanities of the world, after He hath been imprisoned in the most desolate of cities?
                        Be fair in your judgment and follow not the footsteps of the unjust.

                        Say: We, in truth, have opened unto you the gates of the Kingdom. Will ye bar the
                        doors of your houses in My face? This indeed is naught but a grievous error. He, verily,
                        hath again come down from heaven, even as He came down from it the first time. Beware
                        lest ye dispute that which He proclaimeth, even as the people before you disputed
                        His utterances. Thus instructeth you the True One, could ye but perceive it.

                        House, and the Burning Bush calleth aloud: “He Who is the Desired One is come in His
                        transcendent majesty.” Say, Lo! The Father is come, and that which ye were promised
                        in the Kingdom is fulfilled! This is the Word which the Son concealed, when to those
                        around Him He said: “Ye cannot bear it now.” And when the appointed time was fulfilled
                        and the Hour had struck, the Word shone forth above the horizon of the Will of God.
                        Beware, O followers of the Son, that ye cast it not behind your backs. Take ye fast
                        hold of it. Better is this for you than all that ye possess. Verily He is nigh unto
                        them that do good. The Hour which We had concealed from the knowledge of the peoples
                        of the earth and of the favored angels hath come to pass. Say, verily, He hath testified
                        of Me, and I do testify of Him. Indeed, He hath purposed no one other than Me. Unto
                        this beareth witness every fair-minded and understanding soul.

                        to be sorely abased that ye may attain unto glory, and yet, ye are disporting yourselves
                        in the vale of heedlessness. He, in truth, liveth in the most desolate of abodes for

                        bidden by the All-Powerful, He Who is the Bearer of the Trust of God. Purge ye your

                        Prefer ye to be silent, whilst every stone and every tree shouteth aloud: “The Lord
                        is come in His great glory!”? Well is it with the man who hasteneth unto Him. Verily,
                        he is numbered among them whose names will be eternally recorded and who will be mentioned
                        by the Concourse on High. Thus hath it been decreed by the Spirit in this wondrous
                        Tablet. He that summoneth men in My name is, verily, of Me, and he will show forth
                        that which is beyond the power of all that are on earth. Follow ye the Way of the
                        Lord and walk not in the footsteps of them that are sunk in heedlessness. Well is

                        the dead, directing his steps towards the Way of the Lord. Verily, such a man is regarded,
                        in the sight of God, the True One, as a jewel amongst men and is reckoned with the

                        the signs of His dominion. Ponder this in your hearts, O people, and be not of those
                        who have turned a deaf ear to the admonitions of Him Who is the Almighty, the All-Praised.
                        Let the Breeze of God awaken you. Verily, it hath wafted over the world. Well is it

                        which the Son hath decreed.” And whatsoever hath proceeded out of His blameless, His
                        truth-speaking, trustworthy mouth, can never be altered. The bells, verily, peal out
                        My Name, and lament over Me, but My spirit rejoiceth with evident gladness. The body
                        of the Loved One yearneth for the cross, and His head is eager for the spear, in the
                        path of the All-Merciful. The ascendancy of the oppressor can in no wise deter Him
                        from His purpose. We have summoned all created things to attain the presence of thy

                        gazed upon My realms of glory, quaffed the living waters of My bounty, hath drunk

                        them leave to enter into wedlock that they may bring forth one who will make mention
                        of God, the Lord of the seen and the unseen, the Lord of the Exalted Throne.

                        beg forgiveness and pardon from Him. Confession of sins and transgressions before
                        human beings is not permissible, as it hath never been nor will ever be conducive
                        to divine forgiveness. Moreover such confession before people results in one’s humiliation
                        and abasement, and God—exalted be His glory—wisheth not the humiliation of His servants.
                        Verily He is the Compassionate, the Merciful. The sinner should, between himself and
                        God, implore mercy from the Ocean of mercy, beg forgiveness from the Heaven of generosity
                        and say:

                        the most glorious martyrdom, and I beseech Thee by the mysteries which lie enshrined

                        vain. Leave that soul to himself and turn unto the Lord, the Protector, the Self-Subsisting.
                        Be not the cause of grief, much less of discord and strife. The hope is cherished
                        that ye may obtain true education in the shelter of the tree of His tender mercies
                        and act in accordance with that which God desireth. Ye are all the leaves of one tree

                        ‘O inmates of earth and heaven! Behold ye My beauty, and My radiance, and My revelation,
                        and My effulgence. By God, the True One! I am Trustworthiness and the revelation thereof,

                        people of Bahá, and the vesture of glory unto all who are in the kingdom of creation.
                        I am the supreme instrument for the prosperity of the world, and the horizon of assurance

                        the Speaker on Sinai Who is now seated upon the throne of Revelation. He is the Hidden
                        Mystery and the Treasured Symbol. All the former and latter Books of God are adorned
                        with His praise and extol His glory. Through Him the standard of knowledge hath been
                        planted in the world and the ensign of the oneness of God hath been unfurled amidst
                        all peoples. Attainment unto the Divine Presence can be realized solely by attaining
                        His presence. Through His potency everything that hath, from time immemorial, been
                        veiled and hidden, is now revealed. He is made manifest through the power of Truth
                        and hath uttered a Word whereby all that are in the heavens and on the earth have
                        been dumbfounded, except those whom the Almighty was pleased to exempt. True belief
                        in God and recognition of Him cannot be complete save by acceptance of that which
                        He hath revealed and by observance of whatsoever hath been decreed by Him and set

                        in His behest.” Nevertheless if We reveal aught which, even to the extent of a needle’s

                        it. Say, none can ever fathom the manifold exigencies of God’s consummate wisdom.
                        In truth, were He to pronounce the earth to be heaven, no one hath the right to question
                        His authority. This is that whereunto the Point of the Bayán hath testified in all

                        Dawn to break.

                        of such  sciences, however, should be acquired as can profit the peoples of the earth,
                        and not those which begin with words and end with words. Great indeed is the claim

                        Báb in the beginning of the Bayán saith: “He is the One Who shall proclaim under all

                        be made manifest, saith: “I would be the first to adore Him.” Now it behooveth one
                        to reflect upon the significance of the “Adorer” and the “Adored One,” that perchance

                        and proclaim Thy Cause amidst Thy servants. Verily, potent art Thou to do what Thou
                        willest, and within Thy grasp lie the reins of all affairs. No God is there but Thee,
                        the Mighty, the Ever-Forgiving.

                        <a id="509014315" class="brl-location"></a>O thou who hast turned thy gaze towards My face! In these days there occurred that
                        which hath plunged Me into dire sadness. Certain wrong-doers who profess allegiance
                        to the Cause of God committed such deeds as have caused the limbs of sincerity, of
                        honesty, of justice, of equity to quake. One known individual to whom the utmost kindness
                        and favor had been extended perpetrated such acts as have brought tears to the eye
                        of God. Formerly We uttered words of warning and premonition, then for a number of
                        years We kept the matter secret that haply he might take heed and repent. But all
                        to no purpose. In the end he bent his energies upon vilifying the Cause of God before
                        the eyes of all men. He tore the veil of fairness asunder and felt sympathy neither
                        for himself nor for the Cause of God. Now, however, the deeds of certain individuals
                        have  brought sorrows far more grievous than those which the deeds of the former had
                        caused. Beseech thou God, the True One, that He may graciously enable the heedless
                        to retract and repent. Verily He is the Forgiving, the Bountiful, the Most Generous.

                        <a id="904903850" class="brl-location"></a>In these days it is incumbent upon everyone to adhere tenaciously unto unity and concord
                        and to labor diligently in promoting the Cause of God, that perchance the wayward
                        souls may attain that which will lead unto abiding prosperity.

                        <a id="629774080" class="brl-location"></a>In brief, dissensions among various sects have opened the way to weakness. Each sect
                        hath picked out a way for itself and is clinging to a certain cord. Despite manifest
                        blindness and ignorance they pride themselves on their insight and knowledge. Among
                        them are mystics who bear allegiance to the Faith of Islám, some of whom indulge in
                        that which leadeth to idleness and seclusion. I swear by God! It lowereth man’s station
                        and maketh him swell with pride. Man must bring forth fruit. One who yieldeth no fruit
                        is, in the words of the Spirit,<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#138984008">3</a></sup> like unto a fruitless tree, and a fruitless tree is fit but for the fire.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="627745039" class="brl-location"></a>That which the aforesaid persons have mentioned concerning the stations of Divine
                        Unity will conduce in no small measure to idleness and vain imaginings. These mortal
                        men have evidently set aside the differences of station and have come to regard themselves
                        as God, while God is immeasurably exalted above all things. Every created being however
                        revealeth His signs which are but emanations from Him and not His Own Self. All these
                        signs are reflected and can be seen in the book of existence, and the scrolls that
                        depict the shape and pattern of the universe are indeed a most great book. Therein
                        every man  of insight can perceive that which would lead to the Straight Path and
                        would enable him to attain the Great Announcement. Consider the rays of the sun whose
                        light hath encompassed the world. The rays emanate from the sun and reveal its nature,
                        but are not the sun itself. Whatsoever can be discerned on earth amply demonstrateth
                        the power of God, His knowledge and the outpourings of His bounty, while He Himself
                        is immeasurably exalted above all creatures.

                        <a id="406566110" class="brl-location"></a>Christ saith: “Thou hast granted to children that whereof the learned and the wise
                        are deprived.” The sage of Sabzívar<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#730607669">4</a></sup> hath said: “Alas! Attentive ears are lacking, otherwise the whisperings of the Sinaic
                        Bush could be heard from every tree.” In a Tablet to a man of wisdom who had made
                        enquiry as to the meaning of Elementary Reality, We addressed this famous sage in
                        these words: “If this saying is truly thine, how is it that thou hast failed to hearken
                        unto the Call which the Tree of Man hath raised from the loftiest heights of the world?
                        If thou didst hear the Call yet fear and the desire to preserve thy life prompted
                        thee to remain heedless to it, thou art such a person as hath never been nor is worthy
                        of mention; if thou hast not heard it, then thou art bereft of the sense of hearing.”
                        In brief, such men are they whose words are the pride of the world, and whose deeds
                        are the shame of the nations.

                        utterance; it is a noble fruit that the Tree of the Pen of Glory hath yielded. Happy
                        is the man that giveth ear unto it and observeth its precepts. Verily I say, whatever
                        is sent down from the heaven of the Will of God is the means for the establishment
                        of order in the world and the instrument for promoting unity and fellowship among
                        its peoples. Thus hath the Tongue of this Wronged One spoken from His Most Great Prison.

                        people of the Bayán have turned away from the Lord of being. In truth the station
                        of  this Revelation transcendeth the station of whatever hath been manifested in the
                        past or will be made manifest in the future.

                        to acknowledge this Cause, then the very blessed words which have streamed forth from
                        the wellspring of His Own Bayán would apply to Him. He saith, and His word is the
                        truth, “Lawful is it for Him Whom God will make manifest to reject him who is the
                        greatest on earth.” Say, O ye that are bereft of understanding! Today that Most Exalted
                        Being is proclaiming: “Verily, verily, I am the first to adore Him.” How shallow is
                        the fund of men’s knowledge and how feeble their power of perception. Our Pen of Glory
                        beareth witness to their abject poverty and to the wealth of God, the Lord of all
                        worlds.

                        Truth, the Knower of things unseen. The Mother Book is revealed and the Lord of Bounty
                        is established upon the most blessed seat of glory. The Dawn hath broken, yet the

                        knowledge. These words were formerly spoken by My Herald Who at this hour proclaimeth:
                        “Verily, verily, I am the first to adore Him.” Be fair, O My brother. Art thou able
                        to express thyself when brought face to face with the billowing ocean of Mine utterance?
                        Canst thou unloose thy tongue when confronted with the shrill voice of My Pen? Hast
                        thou any power  before the revelations of Mine omnipotence? Judge thou fairly, I adjure
                        thee by God, and call to mind when thou didst stand in the presence of this Wronged
                        One and We dictated to thee the verses of God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting.
                        Beware lest the source of falsehood withhold thee from the manifest Truth.

                        of a droplet ye have deprived yourselves of the ocean of heavenly verses and for the

                        Daystar of Truth. Who else but Bahá hath the power to speak forth before the face
                        of mankind? Judge ye fairly and be not of the unjust. Through Him the oceans have
                        surged, the mysteries have been divulged and the trees have lifted up their voices
                        exclaiming: The kingdoms of earth and heaven are God’s, the Revealer of signs, the
                        Fountainhead of clear tokens. Peruse ye the Persian Bayán revealed by Him Who heralded
                        this Revelation and look at it with the eye of fairness. Verily He will guide you
                        aright to His Path. At this moment He proclaimeth that which His tongue had formerly
                        uttered when He was seated upon the throne of His most exalted Name.

                        and the Tongue of Grandeur hath, from the realm of glory, proclaimed: By the righteousness

                        said, and His word is the truth: “Of all the tributes I have paid to Him Who is to
                        come after Me, the greatest is this, My written confession, that no words of Mine
                        can adequately describe  Him, nor can any reference to Him in My Book, the Bayán,
                        do justice to His Cause.”

                        bear the testimony of the bounties vouchsafed unto thee. Arise for the triumph of
                        My Cause, and, through the power of thine utterance, subdue the hearts of men. Thou
                        must show forth that which will ensure the peace and the well-being of the miserable
                        and the downtrodden. Gird up the loins of thine endeavor, that perchance thou mayest
                        release the captive from his chains, and enable him to attain unto true liberty.

                        <a id="028989218" class="brl-location"></a>Justice is, in this day, bewailing its plight, and Equity groaneth beneath the yoke
                        of oppression. The thick clouds of tyranny have darkened the face of the earth, and
                        enveloped its peoples. Through the movement of Our Pen of glory We have, at the bidding
                        of the omnipotent Ordainer, breathed a new life into every human frame, and instilled
                        into every word a fresh potency. All created things proclaim the evidences of this
                        worldwide regeneration. This is the most great, the most joyful tidings imparted by
                        the Pen of this Wronged One to mankind. Wherefore fear ye, O My well-beloved ones?
                        Who is it that can dismay you? A touch of moisture sufficeth to dissolve the hardened
                        clay out of which this perverse generation is molded. The mere act of your gathering
                        together is enough to scatter the forces of these vain and worthless people.

                        <a id="516614286" class="brl-location"></a>Strife and conflict befit the beasts of the wild. It was through the grace of God
                        and with the aid of seemly words and praiseworthy deeds that the unsheathed swords
                        of the Bábí community were returned to their scabbards. Indeed through the power of
                        good words, the righteous have always succeeded in winning command over the meads
                        of the hearts of men. Say, O ye loved ones! Do not forsake prudence. Incline your
                        hearts to the counsels given by the Most Exalted Pen and beware lest your hands or
                        tongues cause harm unto anyone among mankind.

                        <a id="937626311" class="brl-location"></a>Referring to the land of Tá [Ṭihrán] We have revealed in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas that which
                        will admonish mankind. They that perpetrate tyranny in the world have usurped the
                        rights of the peoples and kindreds of the earth and are sedulously pursuing their
                        selfish inclinations. The tyrant<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#323515898">2</a></sup> of the land of Yá [Yazd], committed that which hath caused the Concourse on High
                        to shed tears of blood.

                        <a id="814576973" class="brl-location"></a>O thou who hast quaffed from the wine of Mine utterance and hast fixed thy gaze upon
                        the horizon of My Revelation! How strange that the people of Persia, who were unrivalled
                        in sciences and arts, should have sunk to the lowest level of degradation among the
                        kindreds of the earth. O people! In this blessed, this glorious Day, deprive not yourselves
                        of the liberal effusions of bounty which the Lord of abounding grace hath vouchsafed
                        unto you. In this Day showers of wisdom and utterance are pouring down from the clouds
                        of divine mercy. Well is it with them who judge His Cause with fairness, and woe betide
                        the unjust.

                        <a id="386797243" class="brl-location"></a>Every man of insight will, in this day, readily admit that the counsels which the
                        Pen of this Wronged One hath revealed constitute the supreme animating power for the
                        advancement of the world and the exaltation of its peoples. Arise, O people, and,
                        by the power of God’s might, resolve to gain the victory over your own selves, that
                        haply the whole earth may be freed and sanctified from its servitude to the gods of
                        its idle fancies—gods that have inflicted such loss upon, and are responsible for
                        the misery of their wretched worshippers. These idols form the obstacle that impedeth
                        man in his efforts to advance in the path of perfection. We cherish the hope that
                        the Hand of divine power may lend its assistance to mankind and deliver it from its
                        state of grievous abasement.

                        <a id="477099463" class="brl-location"></a>In one of the Tablets these words have been revealed: O people of God! Do not busy
                        yourselves in your own concerns; let your thoughts be fixed upon that which will rehabilitate
                        the fortunes of mankind and sanctify the hearts and souls of men. This can best be
                        achieved through pure and holy deeds, through a virtuous life and a goodly behavior.
                        Valiant acts will ensure the triumph of this Cause, and a saintly character will reinforce
                        its power. Cleave unto righteousness, O people of Bahá! This, verily, is the commandment
                        which this Wronged One hath given unto you, and the first choice of His unrestrained
                        Will for every one of you.
                     </p>

                        <a id="697535395" class="brl-location"></a>O friends! It behooveth you to refresh and revive your souls through the gracious
                        favors which in this Divine, this soul-stirring Springtime are being showered upon
                        you. The Daystar of His great glory hath shed its radiance upon you, and the clouds
                        of His limitless grace have overshadowed you. How high the reward of him that hath
                        not deprived himself of so great a bounty, nor failed to  recognize the beauty of
                        his Best-Beloved in this, His new attire. Watch over yourselves, for the Evil One
                        is lying in wait, ready to entrap you. Gird yourselves against his wicked devices,
                        and, led by the light of the name of the All-Seeing God, make your escape from the
                        darkness that surroundeth you. Let your vision be world-embracing, rather than confined
                        to your own self. The Evil One is he that hindereth the rise and obstructeth the spiritual
                        progress of the children of men.

                        <a id="354019569" class="brl-location"></a>It is incumbent upon every man, in this Day, to hold fast unto whatsoever will promote
                        the interests, and exalt the station, of all nations and just governments. Through
                        each and every one of the verses which the Pen of the Most High hath revealed, the
                        doors of love and unity have been unlocked and flung open to the face of men. We have
                        erewhile declared—and Our Word is the truth—: “Consort with the followers of all religions
                        in a spirit of friendliness and fellowship.” Whatsoever hath led the children of men
                        to shun one another, and hath caused dissensions and divisions amongst them, hath,
                        through the revelation of these words, been nullified and abolished. From the heaven
                        of God’s Will, and for the purpose of ennobling the world of being and of elevating
                        the minds and souls of men, hath been sent down that which is the most effective instrument
                        for the education of the whole human race. The highest essence and most perfect expression
                        of whatsoever the peoples of old have either said or written hath, through this most
                        potent Revelation, been sent down from the heaven of the Will of the All-Possessing,
                        the Ever-Abiding God. Of old it hath been revealed: “Love of one’s country is an element
                        of the Faith of God.” The Tongue of Grandeur hath, however, in the day of His manifestation
                        proclaimed: “It is not his to boast who loveth his country, but it is his  who loveth
                        the world.” Through the power released by these exalted words He hath lent a fresh
                        impulse and set a new direction to the birds of men’s hearts, and hath obliterated
                        every trace of restriction and limitation from God’s holy Book.

                        <a id="944336825" class="brl-location"></a>This Wronged One hath forbidden the people of God to engage in contention or conflict
                        and hath exhorted them to righteous deeds and praiseworthy character. In this day
                        the hosts that can ensure the victory of the Cause are those of goodly conduct and
                        saintly character. Blessed are they who firmly adhere unto them and woe betide such
                        as turn away therefrom.

                        <a id="245257943" class="brl-location"></a>O people of God! I admonish you to observe courtesy, for above all else it is the
                        prince of virtues. Well is it with him who is illumined with the light of courtesy
                        and is attired with the vesture of uprightness. Whoso is endued with courtesy hath
                        indeed attained a sublime station. It is hoped that this Wronged One and everyone
                        else may be enabled to acquire it, hold fast unto it, observe it, and fix our gaze
                        upon it. This is a binding command which hath streamed forth from the Pen of the Most
                        Great Name.

                        <a id="422863394" class="brl-location"></a>This is the day when the gems of constancy that lie hid in the mine of men’s inner
                        selves should be made manifest. O people of Justice! Be as brilliant as the light
                        and as splendid as the fire that blazed in the Burning Bush. The brightness of the
                        fire of your love will no doubt fuse and unify the contending peoples and kindreds
                        of the earth, whilst the fierceness of the flame of enmity and hatred cannot but result
                        in strife and ruin. We beseech God that He may shield His creatures from the evil
                        designs of His enemies. He verily hath power over all things.

                        <a id="529685433" class="brl-location"></a>All praise be to the one true God—exalted be His glory—inasmuch as He hath, through
                        the Pen of the Most High,  unlocked the doors of men’s hearts. Every verse which this
                        Pen hath revealed is a bright and shining portal that discloseth the glories of a
                        saintly and pious life, of pure and stainless deeds. The summons and the message which
                        We gave were never intended to reach or to benefit one land or one people only. Mankind
                        in its entirety must firmly adhere to whatsoever hath been revealed and vouchsafed
                        unto it. Then and only then will it attain unto true liberty. The whole earth is illuminated
                        with the resplendent glory of God’s Revelation. In the year sixty He Who heralded
                        the light of Divine Guidance—may all creation be a sacrifice unto Him—arose to announce
                        a fresh revelation of the Divine Spirit, and was followed, twenty years later, by
                        Him through Whose coming the world was made the recipient of this promised glory,
                        this wondrous favor. Behold how the generality of mankind hath been endued with the
                        capacity to hearken unto God’s most exalted Word—the Word upon which must depend the
                        gathering together and spiritual resurrection of all men.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="298892787" class="brl-location"></a>Whilst in the Prison of Akká, We revealed in the Crimson Book that which is conducive
                        to the advancement of mankind and to the reconstruction of the world. The utterances
                        set forth therein by the Pen of the Lord of creation include the following which constitute
                        the fundamental principles for the administration of the affairs of men:
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="452861545" class="brl-location"></a>First: It is incumbent upon the ministers of the House of Justice to promote the Lesser
                        Peace so that the people of the earth may be relieved from the burden of exorbitant
                        expenditures. This matter is imperative and absolutely essential, inasmuch as hostilities
                        and conflict lie at the root of affliction and calamity.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="946207873" class="brl-location"></a>Second: Languages must be reduced to one common language to be taught in all the schools
                        of the world.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="308076734" class="brl-location"></a>Third: It behooveth man to adhere tenaciously unto that which will promote fellowship,
                        kindliness and unity.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="350850731" class="brl-location"></a>Fourth: Everyone, whether man or woman, should hand over to a trusted person a portion
                        of what he or she earneth through trade, agriculture or other occupation, for the
                        training and education of children, to be spent for this purpose with the knowledge
                        of the Trustees of the House of Justice.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="512736869" class="brl-location"></a>Fifth: Special regard must be paid to agriculture. Although it hath been mentioned
                        in the fifth place, unquestionably it precedeth the others. Agriculture is highly
                        developed in foreign lands, however in Persia it hath so far been grievously neglected.
                        It is hoped that His Majesty the <u>Sh</u>áh—may God assist him by His grace—will turn his attention to this vital and important
                        matter.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="619293129" class="brl-location"></a>Were men to strictly observe that which the Pen of the Most High hath revealed in
                        the Crimson Book, they could then well afford to dispense with the regulations which
                        prevail in the world. Certain exhortations have repeatedly streamed forth from the
                        Pen of the Most High that perchance the manifestations of power and the dawning-places
                        of might may, sometime, be enabled to enforce them. Indeed, were sincere seekers to
                        be found, every emanation of God’s pervasive and irresistible Will would, for the
                        sake of His love, be revealed. But where are to be found earnest seekers and inquiring
                        minds? Whither are gone the equitable and the fair-minded? At present no day passeth
                        without the fire of a fresh tyranny blazing fiercely, or the sword of a new aggression
                        being unsheathed. Gracious God! The great and the noble in Persia glory in acts of
                        such savagery that one is lost in amazement at the tales thereof.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="840010249" class="brl-location"></a>Day and night this Wronged One yieldeth thanks and praise unto the Lord of men, for
                        it is witnessed that the  words of counsel and exhortation We uttered have proved
                        effective and that this people hath evinced such character and conduct as are acceptable
                        in Our sight. This is affirmed by virtue of the event which hath truly cheered the
                        eye of the world, and is none other than the intercession of the friends with the
                        high authorities in favor of their enemies. Indeed one’s righteous deeds testify to
                        the truth of one’s words. We cherish the hope that men of piety may illumine the world
                        through the radiant light of their conduct, and We entreat the Almighty—glorified
                        and exalted is He—to grant that everyone may in this Day remain steadfast in His love
                        and stand firm in His Cause. He is, in truth, the Protector of those who are wholly
                        devoted to Him and observe His precepts.

                        <a id="047798860" class="brl-location"></a>O people of God! Countless are the realms which Our Pen of Glory hath revealed and
                        manifold the eyes to which it hath imparted true enlightenment. Yet most of the people
                        in Persia continue to be deprived of the benefits of profitable counsels and remain
                        sorely lacking in useful sciences and arts. Formerly these sublime words were especially
                        revealed by the Pen of Glory in honor of one of the faithful, that perchance those
                        that have gone astray may embrace the Truth and become acquainted with the subtleties
                        of the Law of God.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="111943136" class="brl-location"></a>The unbelievers and the faithless have set their minds on four things: first, the
                        shedding of blood; second, the burning of books; third, the shunning of the followers
                        of other religions; fourth, the extermination of other communities and groups. Now
                        however, through the strengthening grace and potency of the Word of God these four
                        barriers have been demolished, these clear injunctions have been obliterated from
                        the Tablet and brutal dispositions have been transmuted into spiritual attributes.
                        Exalted is His  purpose; glorified is His power; magnified is His dominion! Now let
                        us beseech God—praised be His glory—to graciously guide aright the followers of the
                        <u>Sh</u>í‘ih sect and to purge them of unseemly conduct. From the lips of the members of this
                        sect foul imprecations fall unceasingly, while they invoke the word “Mal‘ún” (accursed)—uttered
                        with a guttural sound of the letter ‘ayn—as their daily relish.
                     </p>

                        <a id="224360317" class="brl-location"></a>O God my God! Thou hearest the sighing of Him Who is Thy Light (Bahá), hearkenest
                        unto His lamentations in the daytime and in the night season and knowest that He desireth
                        naught for Himself but rather seeketh to sanctify the souls of Thy servants and to
                        deliver them from the fire with which they are beset at all times. O Lord! The hands
                        of Thy well-favored servants are raised towards the heaven of Thy bounty and those
                        of Thy sincere lovers are lifted up to the sublime heights of Thy generosity. Disappoint
                        them not, I entreat Thee, in that which they seek from the ocean of Thy favor and
                        from the heaven of Thy grace and the daystar of Thy bounty. Aid them, O Lord, to acquire
                        such virtues as will exalt their stations among the peoples of the world. Verily Thou
                        art the Powerful, the Mighty, the Most Generous.

                        <a id="979523164" class="brl-location"></a>O people of God! Give ear unto that which, if heeded, will ensure the freedom, well-being,
                        tranquility, exaltation and advancement of all men. Certain laws and principles are
                        necessary and indispensable for Persia. However, it is fitting that these measures
                        should be adopted in conformity with the considered views of His Majesty—may God aid
                        him through His grace—and of the learned divines and of the high-ranking rulers. Subject
                        to their approval a place should be fixed where they would meet. There they should
                        hold fast to the cord of consultation and adopt and enforce  that which is conducive
                        to the security, prosperity, wealth and tranquility of the people. For were any measure
                        other than this to be adopted, it could not but result in chaos and commotion.

                        <a id="978227700" class="brl-location"></a>According to the fundamental laws which We have formerly revealed in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas
                        and other Tablets, all affairs are committed to the care of just kings and presidents
                        and of the Trustees of the House of Justice. Having pondered on that which We have
                        enunciated, every man of equity and discernment will readily perceive, with his inner
                        and outer eyes, the splendors of the daystar of justice which radiate therefrom.

                        to be good, for it is adorned with the light of both kingship and of the consultation

                        <a id="788704971" class="brl-location"></a>In formulating the principles and laws a part hath been devoted to penalties which
                        form an effective instrument for the security and protection of men. However, dread
                        of the penalties maketh people desist only outwardly from committing vile and contemptible
                        deeds, while that which guardeth and restraineth man both outwardly and inwardly hath
                        been and still is the fear of God. It is man’s true protector and his spiritual guardian.
                        It behooveth him to cleave tenaciously unto that which will lead to the appearance
                        of this supreme bounty. Well is it with him who giveth ear unto whatsoever My Pen
                        of Glory hath proclaimed and observeth that whereunto he is bidden by the Ordainer,

                        in the hearts of men. It is incumbent upon you to  foster its growth through the living
                        waters of wisdom, of sanctified and holy words, so that its root may become firmly
                        fixed and its branches may spread out as high as the heavens and beyond.

                        of this Supreme Revelation consisteth in that We have, on the one hand, blotted out
                        from the pages of God’s holy Book whatsoever hath been the cause of strife, of malice
                        and mischief amongst the children of men, and have, on the other, laid down the essential
                        prerequisites of concord, of understanding, of complete and enduring unity. Well is

                        whatsoever from which the odor of mischief can be detected. The world is in great
                        turmoil, and the minds of its people are in a state of utter confusion. We entreat
                        the Almighty that He may graciously illuminate them with the glory of His Justice,
                        and enable them to discover that which will be profitable unto them at all times and

                        reported that a certain person<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#329669707">3</a></sup> went to the seat of the imperial throne in Persia and succeeded in winning the good
                        graces of some of the nobility by his ingratiating behavior. How pitiful indeed, how
                        deplorable! One wondereth why those who have  been the symbols of highest glory should
                        now stoop to boundless shame. What is become of their high resolve? Whither is gone
                        the sense of dignity and honor? The sun of glory and wisdom hath unceasingly been
                        shining above the horizon of Persia, but nowadays it hath sunk to such a low level
                        that certain dignitaries have allowed themselves to be treated as playthings in the
                        hands of the foolish. The aforesaid person hath written such things concerning this
                        people in the Egyptian press and in the Beirut Encyclopedia that the well-informed
                        and the learned were astonished. He proceeded then to Paris where he published a newspaper
                        entitled <span class="brl-italic">‘Urvatu’l-Vu<u>th</u>qá</span> [The Sure Handle] and sent copies thereof to all parts of the world. He also sent
                        a copy to the Prison of ‘Akká, and by so doing he meant to show affection and to make
                        amends for his past actions. In short, this Wronged One hath observed silence in regard
                        to him. We entreat God, the True One, to protect him and to shed upon him the light
                        of justice and fairness. It behooveth him to say:

                        I beg of Thee by Thy sweet accents and by the shrill voice of Thy Pen, O Lord of all
                        mankind, to graciously aid Thy servants as it befitteth Thy days and beseemeth the
                        glory of Thy manifestation and Thy majesty. Verily potent art Thou to do whatsoever
                        Thou willest. All they that dwell in the heavens and on the earth bear witness to
                        Thy power and Thy might, to Thy glory and Thy bounteousness. Praise be to Thee, O
                        Lord of the worlds and the Well-Beloved of the heart of every man of understanding!

                        the doors of sciences, of arts, of knowledge, of well-being, of prosperity and wealth.
                        Neither have the wrongs inflicted by the oppressors succeeded in silencing the shrill

                        <a id="340204419" class="brl-location"></a>This Point is the focal center of the circle of Names and marketh the culmination
                        of the manifestations of Letters in the world of creation. Through it have appeared
                        indications of the impenetrable Mystery, the adorned Symbol, He Who standeth revealed
                        in the Most Great Name—a Name which is recorded in the luminous Tablet and is inscribed
                        in the holy, the blessed, the snow-white Scroll. And when the Point was joined to
                        the second Letter<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#385673688">1</a></sup> which  appeareth in the beginning of the Ma<u>th</u>ání,<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#260748629">2</a></sup> it traversed the heavens of exposition and utterance. Then the eternal Light of God
                        shed its radiance, flared up in the midmost heart of the firmament of testimony and
                        produced two Luminaries. Glorified be the Merciful One, unto Whom no allusion can
                        be made, Whom no expression can define, nor any assertion reveal, nor any evidence
                        describe. He is in truth the Ordainer, the All-Bountiful, both in the beginning and
                        in the end. And He provided for them protectors and defenders from among the hosts
                        of power and might. Verily, He is the Help in Peril, the Mighty, the Unconstrained.

                        numerous meanings and diverse stations. In one sense it is applicable to the One Whom
                        God hath made immune from error. Similarly it is applied to every soul whom God hath
                        guarded against sin, transgression, rebellion, impiety, disbelief and the like. However,
                        the Most Great Infallibility is confined to the One Whose station is immeasurably
                        exalted beyond ordinances or prohibitions and is sanctified from errors and omissions.

                        revealed verse in which pilgrimage to the House is enjoined upon everyone. It devolved
                        upon those invested with authority after Him<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#687330535">11</a></sup> to observe whatever had been prescribed unto them in the Book. Unto no one is given

                        is reckoned with the trespassers in the Book of God, the Lord of the Mighty Throne.

                        and God doth not tread in their ways. Rather is it incumbent upon everyone to firmly
                        adhere to God’s straight Path. Were He to pronounce the right to be the left or the
                        south to be the north, He speaketh the truth and there is no doubt of it. Verily He
                        is to be praised in His acts and to be obeyed in His behests. He hath no associate
                        in His judgment nor any helper in His sovereignty. He doeth whatsoever He willeth
                        and ordaineth whatsoever He  pleaseth. Know thou moreover that all else besides Him
                        have been created through the potency of a word from His presence, while of themselves
                        they have no motion nor stillness, except at His bidding and by His leave.

                        Thou hast prescribed for me in Thy Book and may stand firm in Thy service and in the
                        service of Thy loved ones. Graciously assist then Thy servants, O my God, to do that
                        which will serve to exalt Thy Cause and will enable them to observe whatsoever Thou
                        hast revealed in Thy Book.

                        the radiance thereof, the heavens and the stars thereof, the shells and the pearls
                        thereof. Render thou thanks unto God for so great a bounty, so gracious a favor that

                        <a id="726726483" class="brl-location"></a>O thou who hast set thy face towards the splendors of My Countenance! Vague fancies
                        have encompassed the dwellers of the earth and debarred them from turning towards
                        the Horizon of Certitude, and its brightness, and its manifestations and its lights.
                        Vain imaginings have withheld them from Him Who is the Self-Subsisting. They speak
                        as prompted by their own caprices, and understand not. Among them are those who have
                        said: “Have the verses been sent down?” Say “Yea, by Him Who is the Lord of the heavens!”
                        “Hath the Hour come?” “Nay, more; it hath passed, by Him Who is the Revealer of clear
                        tokens! Verily, the Inevitable is come, and He, the True One, hath appeared with proof
                        and testimony. The Plain is disclosed, and mankind is sore vexed and fearful. Earthquakes
                        have broken loose, and the tribes have lamented,  for fear of God, the Lord of Strength,
                        the All-Compelling.” Say: “The stunning trumpet-blast hath been loudly raised, and
                        the Day is God’s, the One, the Unconstrained.” And they say: “Hath the Catastrophe
                        come to pass?” Say: “Yea, by the Lord of Lords!” “Is the Resurrection come?” “Nay,
                        more; He Who is the Self-Subsisting hath appeared with the Kingdom of His signs.”
                        “Seest thou men laid low?” “Yea, by my Lord, the Most High, the Most Glorious!” “Have
                        the tree-stumps been uprooted?” “Yea, more; the mountains have been scattered in dust;
                        by Him the Lord of attributes!” They say: “Where is Paradise, and where is Hell?”
                        Say: “The one is reunion with Me; the other thine own self, O thou who dost associate
                        a partner with God and doubtest.” They say: “We see not the Balance.” Say: “Surely,
                        by my Lord, the God of Mercy! None can see it except such as are endued with insight.”
                        They say: “Have the stars fallen?” Say: “Yea, when He Who is the Self-Subsisting dwelt
                        in the Land of Mystery.<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#119607032">18</a></sup> Take heed, ye who are endued with discernment!” All the signs appeared when We drew
                        forth the Hand of Power from the bosom of majesty and might. Verily, the Crier hath
                        cried out, when the promised time came, and they that have recognized the splendors
                        of Sinai have swooned away in the wilderness of hesitation, before the awful majesty
                        of thy Lord, the Lord of creation. The trumpet asketh: “Hath the Bugle been sounded?”
                        Say: “Yea, by the King of Revelation! when He mounted the throne of His Name, the
                        All-Merciful.” Darkness hath been chased away by the dawning light of the mercy of
                        thy Lord, the Source of all light. The breeze of the All-Merciful hath wafted, and
                        the souls have been quickened in the tombs of their bodies. Thus hath the decree been
                        fulfilled by God, the Mighty, the Beneficent.  They who reject the truth have said:
                        “When were the heavens cleft asunder?” Say: “While ye lay in the graves of waywardness
                        and error.” Among the faithless is he who rubbeth his eyes, and looketh to the right
                        and to the left. Say: “Blinded art thou. No refuge hast thou to flee to.” And among
                        them is he who saith: “Have men been gathered together?” Say: “Yea, by My Lord! whilst
                        thou didst lie in the cradle of idle fancies.” And among them is he who saith: “Hath
                        the Book been sent down through the power of the true Faith?” Say: “The true Faith
                        itself is astounded. Fear ye, O ye men of understanding heart!” And among them is
                        he who saith: “Have I been assembled with others, blind?” Say: “Yea, by Him that rideth
                        upon the clouds!” Paradise is decked with mystic roses, and hell hath been made to
                        blaze with the fire of the impious. Say: “The light hath shone forth from the horizon
                        of Revelation, and the whole earth hath been illumined at the coming of Him Who is
                        the Lord of the Day of the Covenant!” The doubters have perished, whilst he that turned,
                        guided by the light of assurance, unto the Dayspring of Certitude hath prospered.
                        Blessed art thou, who hast fixed thy gaze upon Me, for this Tablet which hath been
                        sent down for thee—a Tablet which causeth the souls of men to soar. Commit it to memory,
                        and recite it. By My life! It is a door to the mercy of thy Lord. Well is it with
                        him that reciteth it at eventide and at dawn. We, verily, heard thy praise of this
                        Cause, through which the mountain of knowledge was crushed, and men’s feet have slipped.
                        My glory be upon thee and upon whomsoever hath turned unto the Almighty, the All-Bounteous.
                        The Tablet is ended, but the theme is unexhausted. Be patient, for thy Lord is patient.

                        the heaven of vain imaginings hath been cleft asunder, and yet the people are in doubt
                        and in contention with Him. They have denied the testimony of God and His proof, after
                        He came from the heaven of power with the kingdom of His signs. They have cast away
                        what had been prescribed, and perpetrated what had been forbidden them in the Book.
                        They have abandoned their God, and clung unto their desires. They truly have strayed
                        and are in error. They read the verses and deny them. They behold the clear tokens
                        and turn aside. They truly are lost in strange doubt.

                        We have forbidden you dissension and conflict in My Books, and My Scriptures, and

                        caused My heart and My Pen to lament. Incline thine ear to that which is sent down

                        it have the cities of men’s hearts been opened throughout the ages and centuries,

                        Our Green Island. Upon Our arrival, We beheld its streams flowing, and its trees luxuriant,
                        and the sunlight playing in their midst. Turning Our face to the right, We beheld
                        what the pen is powerless to describe; nor can it set forth that which the eye of
                        the Lord of Mankind witnessed in that most sanctified, that most sublime, that blest,
                        and most exalted Spot. Turning, then, to the left We gazed on one of the Beauties
                        of the Most Sublime Paradise, standing on a pillar of light, and calling aloud saying:
                        “O inmates of earth and heaven! Behold ye My beauty, and My radiance, and My revelation,
                        and My effulgence. By God, the True One! I am Trustworthiness and the revelation thereof,
                        and the beauty thereof. I will recompense whosoever will cleave unto Me, and recognize
                        My rank and station, and hold fast unto My hem. I am the most great ornament of the
                        people of Bahá, and the vesture of glory unto all who are in the kingdom of creation.
                        I am the supreme instrument for the prosperity of the world, and the horizon of assurance
                        unto all beings.” Thus have We sent down for thee that which will draw men nigh unto
                        the Lord of creation.

                        <a id="309951166" class="brl-location"></a>O thou who hast fixed thy gaze upon the all-glorious Horizon! The Call is raised but
                        hearing ears are numbered, nay nonexistent. This Wronged One findeth himself in the
                        maw of the serpent, yet He faileth not to make mention of the loved ones of God. So
                        grievous have been Our sufferings in these days that the Concourse on High are  moved
                        to tears and to lamentation. Neither the adversities of the world nor the harm inflicted
                        by its nations could deter Him Who is the King of Eternity from voicing His summons
                        or frustrate His purpose. When those who had for years been hiding behind the veils
                        perceived that the horizon of the Cause was resplendent and that the Word of God was
                        all-pervasive, they rushed forth and with swords of malice inflicted such harm as
                        no pen can portray nor any tongue describe.

                        before the rulers and the divines, and hath, in ringing tones, summoned all men unto
                        the straight Path. He hath had no helper save His Pen, nor any succorer other than
                        Himself.

                        rebelled against Him. Such men are the foreboders of evil, whom God hath mentioned
                        in His Book and Tablets and against whose influence, clamor and deception He hath
                        warned His people. Well is it with those who, in the face of the remembrance of the
                        Lord of Eternity, regard the peoples of the world as utter nothingness, as a thing
                        forgotten, and hold fast to the firm handle of God in such wise that neither doubts
                        nor insinuations, nor swords, nor cannon could hold them back or deprive them of His
                        presence. Blessed are the steadfast; blessed are they that stand firm in His Faith.

                        and after Him they were the most learned and the most distinguished among the people
                        and abide in the utmost station of servitude. The divine Essence, sanctified from
                        every comparison and likeness, is established in the Prophet, and God’s inmost Reality,

                        unity and of veritable singleness. The followers of the previous Dispensation grievously
                        failed to acquire an adequate understanding of this station. The Primal Point<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#322780538">23</a></sup>—may the life of all else but Him be offered up for His sake—saith: “If the Seal of

                        been created.”

                        and the sun of  Equity veiled from sight. The robber occupieth the seat of the protector
                        and guard, and the position of the faithful is seized by the traitor. A year ago an
                        oppressor ruled over this city, and at every instant caused fresh harm. By the righteousness
                        of the Lord! He wrought that which cast terror into the hearts of men. But to the
                        Pen of Glory the tyranny of the world hath never been nor will it ever be a hindrance.
                        In the abundance of Our grace and loving-kindness We have revealed specially for the
                        rulers and ministers of the world that which is conducive to safety and protection,

                        and shun all evil. Should the lamp of religion be obscured, chaos and confusion will
                        ensue, and the lights of fairness and justice, of tranquility and peace cease to shine.

                        Inasmuch as for each day there is a new problem and for every problem an expedient
                        solution, such affairs should be referred to the House of Justice that the members

                        of Justice, to endeavor to the utmost of their power to safeguard its position, promote

                        <a id="750643638" class="brl-location"></a>We entreat God to graciously aid His servants. What this Wronged One doth expect from
                        everyone is justice and fairness. Let no one be content with mere hearing; rather
                        doth it behoove everyone to ponder that which this Wronged One hath revealed. I swear
                        by the Daystar of utterance, shining above the horizon of the Kingdom of the All-Merciful,
                        had there been any expounder or speaker discernible, We would not have made Ourself
                        the object of the censure, ridicule and slander of the people.

                        <a id="479513258" class="brl-location"></a>Upon Our arrival in ‘Iráq We found the Cause of God sunk in deep apathy and the breeze
                        of divine revelation stilled. Most of the believers were faint and dispirited, nay
                        utterly lost and dead. Hence there was a second blast on the Trumpet, whereupon the
                        Tongue of Grandeur uttered these blessed words: “We have sounded the Trumpet for the
                        second time.” Thus the whole world was quickened through the vitalizing breaths of
                        divine revelation and inspiration.

                        <a id="293919675" class="brl-location"></a>Certain souls have now sallied forth from behind the veils, intent on inflicting harm
                        upon this Wronged One. They have hindered and denied the outpouring of this priceless
                        bounty.

                        <a id="894604253" class="brl-location"></a>Such as have turned away from the Cause of God are diligently seeking to collect the
                        Holy Writings of this Revelation; and they have already, through gestures of friendship,
                        managed to secure certain of these Writings from those who held them in their possession.
                        Moreover, when they meet the followers of any religion, they hold themselves out as
                        believers therein. Say, die ye in your wrath! Verily He hath appeared with so great
                        an authority that no man of vision, of hearing, of insight, of justice or of equity
                        can ever deny Him. Unto this beareth witness in this resplendent Hour the Pen of Him

                        to do that which is pleasing and acceptable unto Him, to grant that they may deal
                        equitably and may observe justice in this all-compelling Cause, to acquaint them with
                        His Holy Writings and to direct their steps towards His straight Path.

                        subject to Our sanction, hence this Wronged One hath put some of them into effect
                        by embodying them in the Kitáb-i-Aqdas in different words. Others We set aside. He
                        holdeth in His hand the authority. He doeth what He willeth and He ordaineth whatsoever

                        <a id="376902522" class="brl-location"></a>As to thy question concerning interest and profit on gold and silver: Some years ago
                        the following passage was revealed from the heaven of the All-Merciful in honor of
                        the one who beareth the name of God, entitled Zaynu’l-Muqarrabín<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#225730224">25</a></sup>—upon him be the glory of the Most Glorious. He—exalted be His Word—saith: Many people
                        stand in need of this. Because if there were no prospect for gaining interest, the
                        affairs of men would suffer collapse or dislocation. One can seldom find a person
                        who would manifest such consideration towards his fellow-man, his countryman or towards
                        his own brother and would show such tender solicitude for him as to be well-disposed
                        to grant him a loan on benevolent terms.<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#070572605">26</a></sup> Therefore as a token of favor towards men We have prescribed that interest on money
                        should be treated like other business transactions that are current amongst men. Thus,
                        now that this lucid commandment hath descended from the heaven of the Will of God,
                        it is lawful and proper to charge interest on money, that the people of the world
                        may, in a spirit of amity and fellowship and with joy and gladness, devotedly engage
                        themselves in magnifying the Name of Him Who is the Well-Beloved of all mankind. Verily
                        He ordaineth according to His Own choosing. He hath now made interest on money lawful,
                        even as He had made it unlawful in the past. Within His grasp He holdeth the kingdom
                        of authority. He doeth and ordaineth. He is in truth the Ordainer, the All-Knowing.
                     </p>

                        <a id="938109141" class="brl-location"></a>Render thou thanks unto thy Lord, O Zaynu’l-Muqarrabín, for this manifest bounty.

                        <a id="104057010" class="brl-location"></a>Many ecclesiastics in Persia have, through innumerable designs and devices, been feeding
                        on illicit gains obtained by usury. They have contrived ways to give its outward form
                        a fair semblance of lawfulness. They make a plaything of the laws and ordinances of
                        God, but they understand not.
                     </p>

                        <a id="958351771" class="brl-location"></a>However, this is a matter that should be practiced with moderation and fairness. Our
                        Pen of Glory hath, as a token of wisdom and for the convenience of the people, desisted
                        from laying down its limit. Nevertheless We exhort the loved ones of God to observe
                        justice and fairness, and to do that which would prompt the friends of God to evince
                        tender mercy and compassion towards each other. He is in truth the Counselor, the
                        Compassionate, the All-Bountiful. God grant that all men may be graciously aided to
                        observe that which the Tongue of the One true God hath uttered. And if they put into
                        practice what We have set forth, God—exalted be His glory—will assuredly double their
                        portion through the heaven of His bounty. Verily He is the Generous, the Forgiving,
                        the Compassionate. Praise be unto God, the Most Exalted, the Most Great.

                        be shining examples unto all mankind, and true reminders of the virtues of God amidst
                        men. He that riseth to serve My Cause should manifest My wisdom, and bend every effort
                        to banish ignorance from the earth. Be united in counsel, be one in thought. Let each
                        morn be better than its eve and each morrow richer than its yesterday. Man’s merit
                        lieth in service and virtue and not in the pageantry of wealth and riches. Take heed
                        that your words be purged from idle fancies and worldly desires and your deeds be
                        cleansed from craftiness and suspicion. Dissipate not the wealth of your precious

                        in promoting your personal interest. Be generous in your days of plenty, and be patient
                        in the hour of loss. Adversity is followed by success and rejoicings follow woe. Guard
                        against idleness and sloth, and cling unto that which profiteth mankind, whether young
                        or old, whether high or low. Beware lest ye sow tares of dissension among men or plant
                        thorns of doubt in pure and radiant hearts.

                        your tongue truthful and your heart enlightened. Abase not the station of the learned
                        in Bahá and belittle not the rank of such rulers as administer justice amidst you.

                        <a id="210171071" class="brl-location"></a>By My life! Thy grievances have plunged Me into sorrow. Regard not the children of
                        the world and all their doings but fix thy gaze upon God and His never-ending dominion.
                        Verily, He calleth to thy remembrance that which is the source of delight for all
                        mankind. Drink thou the life-giving water of blissful joy from the chalice of utterance
                        proffered by the Fountainhead of divine Revelation—He Who hath made mention of thee
                        in this mighty stronghold. Endeavor to the utmost of thy powers to establish the word
                        of truth with eloquence and wisdom and to dispel falsehood from the face of the earth.
                        Thus directeth thee the Dayspring of divine knowledge from this luminous horizon.

                        in My days. We revealed unto one of the rulers that which overpowereth all the dwellers
                        of the earth, and requested him to bring Us face to face with the learned men of this
                        age, that We might set forth for him the testimony of God, His proofs, His glory and
                        His majesty; and naught did We intend thereby but the highest good. However, he committed
                        that which hath caused the inmates of the cities of justice and equity to lament.
                        Thus hath judgment been given between Me and him. Verily thy Lord is the Ordainer,
                        the All-Informed. In such circumstances as thou seest, how can the Celestial Bird
                        soar into the atmosphere of divine mysteries when its wings have been battered with
                        the stones of idle fancy and bitter hatred, and it is cast into a prison built of
                        unyielding  stone? By the righteousness of God! The people have perpetrated a grievous
                        injustice.

                        <a id="559559435" class="brl-location"></a>As regards thine assertions about the beginning of creation, this is a matter on which
                        conceptions vary by reason of the divergences in men’s thoughts and opinions. Wert
                        thou to assert that it hath ever existed and shall continue to exist, it would be
                        true; or wert thou to affirm the same concept as is mentioned in the sacred Scriptures,
                        no doubt would there be about it, for it hath been revealed by God, the Lord of the
                        worlds. Indeed He was a hidden treasure. This is a station that can never be described
                        nor even alluded to. And in the station of “I did wish to make Myself known,” God
                        was, and His creation had ever existed beneath His shelter from the beginning that
                        hath no beginning, apart from its being preceded by a Firstness which cannot be regarded
                        as firstness and originated by a Cause inscrutable even unto all men of learning.
                     </p>

                        <a id="893372526" class="brl-location"></a>That which hath been in existence had existed before, but not in the form thou seest
                        today. The world of existence came into being through the heat generated from the
                        interaction between the active force and that which is its recipient. These two are
                        the same, yet they are different. Thus doth the Great Announcement inform thee about
                        this glorious structure. Such as communicate the generating influence and such as
                        receive its impact are indeed created through the irresistible Word of God which is
                        the Cause of the entire creation, while all else besides His Word are but the creatures
                        and the effects thereof. Verily thy Lord is the Expounder, the All-Wise.

                        to that which the senses can perceive, for it is sanctified from any property or 
                        substance. It transcendeth the limitations of known elements and is exalted above
                        all the essential and recognized substances. It became manifest without any syllable
                        or sound and is none but the Command of God which pervadeth all created things. It
                        hath never been withheld from the world of being. It is God’s all-pervasive grace,
                        from which all grace doth emanate. It is an entity far removed above all that hath
                        been and shall be.

                        <a id="854716466" class="brl-location"></a>We are loath to enlarge on this subject, inasmuch as the unbelievers have inclined
                        their ears towards Us in order to hear that which might enable them to cavil against
                        God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting. And since they are unable to attain to
                        mysteries of knowledge and wisdom from what hath been unraveled by the Source of divine
                        splendor, they rise in protest and burst into clamor. But it is true to say that they
                        object to that which they comprehend, not to the expositions given by the Expounder,
                        nor the truths imparted by the One true God, the Knower of things unseen. Their objections,
                        one and all, turn upon themselves, and I swear by thy life that they are devoid of
                        understanding.

                        of God is the Cause which hath preceded the contingent world—a world which is adorned
                        with the splendors of the Ancient of Days, yet is being renewed and regenerated at
                        all times. Immeasurably exalted is the God of Wisdom Who hath raised this sublime

                        <a id="475103576" class="brl-location"></a>Say: Nature in its essence is the embodiment of My Name, the Maker, the Creator. Its
                        manifestations are diversified by varying causes, and in this diversity there are
                        signs for men of discernment. Nature is God’s Will and is its expression in and through
                        the contingent world. It is a dispensation of Providence ordained by the Ordainer,
                        the All-Wise. Were anyone to affirm that it is the Will of God as manifested in the
                        world of being, no one should question this assertion. It is endowed with a power
                        whose reality men of learning fail to grasp. Indeed a man of insight can perceive
                        naught therein save the effulgent splendor of Our Name, the Creator. Say: This is
                        an existence which knoweth no decay, and Nature itself is lost in bewilderment before
                        its revelations, its compelling evidences and its effulgent glory which have encompassed
                        the universe.

                        cause the spirits to be chilled. It behooveth thee to speak forth in such wise as

                        which in turn is dependent upon hearts which are detached and pure. As to its moderation,
                        this hath to be combined with tact and wisdom as prescribed in the Holy Scriptures
                        and Tablets. Meditate upon that which hath streamed forth from the heaven of the Will

                        sages of the past, for it is they who have laid the foundation of philosophy, reared
                        its structure and reinforced its pillars. Thus doth thy Lord, the Ancient of Days,
                        inform thee. The sages aforetime acquired  their knowledge from the Prophets, inasmuch
                        as the latter were the Exponents of divine philosophy and the Revealers of heavenly
                        mysteries. Men quaffed the crystal, living waters of Their utterance, while others
                        satisfied themselves with the dregs. Everyone receiveth a portion according to his

                        <a id="620129159" class="brl-location"></a>Empedocles, who distinguished himself in philosophy, was a contemporary of David,
                        while Pythagoras lived in the days of Solomon, son of David, and acquired Wisdom from
                        the treasury of prophethood. It is he who claimed to have heard the whispering sound
                        of the heavens and to have attained the station of the angels. In truth thy Lord will
                        clearly set forth all things, if He pleaseth. Verily, He is the Wise, the All-Pervading.

                        <a id="786337267" class="brl-location"></a>The essence and the fundamentals of philosophy have emanated from the Prophets. That
                        the people differ concerning the inner meanings and mysteries thereof is to be attributed
                        to the divergence of their views and minds. We would fain recount to thee the following:
                        One of the Prophets once was communicating to his people that with which the Omnipotent
                        Lord had inspired Him. Truly, thy Lord is the Inspirer, the Gracious, the Exalted.
                        When the fountain of wisdom and eloquence gushed forth from the wellspring of His
                        utterance and the wine of divine knowledge inebriated those who had sought His threshold,
                        He exclaimed: “Lo! All are filled with the Spirit.” From among the people there was
                        he who held fast unto this statement and, actuated by his own fancies, conceived the
                        idea that the spirit literally penetrateth or entereth into the body, and through
                        lengthy expositions he advanced proofs to vindicate this concept; and groups of people
                        followed in his footsteps. To mention their names at this point, or to give thee a
                        detailed account thereof, would lead to prolixity, and would depart from the main
                        theme. Verily, thy Lord is the  All-Wise, the All-Knowing. There was also he who partook
                        of the choice wine whose seal had been removed by the Key of the Tongue of Him Who
                        is the Revealer of the Verses of thy Lord, the Gracious, the Most Generous.

                        <a id="886658583" class="brl-location"></a>Verily, the philosophers have not denied the Ancient of Days. Most of them passed
                        away deploring their failure to fathom His mystery, even as some of them have testified.
                        Verily, thy Lord is the Adviser, the All-Informed.

                        <a id="361575361" class="brl-location"></a>Consider Hippocrates, the physician. He was one of the eminent philosophers who believed
                        in God and acknowledged His sovereignty. After him came Socrates who was indeed wise,
                        accomplished and righteous. He practiced self-denial, repressed his appetites for
                        selfish desires and turned away from material pleasures. He withdrew to the mountains
                        where he dwelt in a cave. He dissuaded men from worshipping idols and taught them
                        the way of God, the Lord of Mercy, until the ignorant rose up against him. They arrested
                        him and put him to death in prison. Thus relateth to thee this swift-moving Pen. What
                        a penetrating vision into philosophy this eminent man had! He is the most distinguished
                        of all philosophers and was highly versed in wisdom. We testify that he is one of
                        the heroes in this field and an outstanding champion dedicated unto it. He had a profound
                        knowledge of such sciences as were current amongst men as well as of those which were
                        veiled from their minds. Methinks he drank one draught when the Most Great Ocean overflowed
                        with gleaming and life-giving waters. He it is who perceived a unique, a tempered,
                        and a pervasive nature in things, bearing the closest likeness to the human spirit,
                        and he discovered this nature to be distinct from the substance of things in their
                        refined form. He hath a special pronouncement on this weighty theme. Wert thou to
                        ask from the worldly wise of this generation  about this exposition, thou wouldst
                        witness their incapacity to grasp it. Verily, thy Lord speaketh the truth but most
                        people comprehend not.
                     </p>

                        <a id="740100197" class="brl-location"></a>After Socrates came the divine Plato who was a pupil of the former and occupied the
                        chair of philosophy as his successor. He acknowledged his belief in God and in His
                        signs which pervade all that hath been and shall be. Then came Aristotle, the well-known
                        man of knowledge. He it is who discovered the power of gaseous matter. These men who
                        stand out as leaders of the people and are preeminent among them, one and all acknowledged
                        their belief in the immortal Being Who holdeth in His grasp the reins of all sciences.

                        <a id="622493526" class="brl-location"></a>I will also mention for thee the invocation voiced by Balínús who was familiar with
                        the theories put forward by the Father of Philosophy regarding the mysteries of creation
                        as given in his chrysolite tablets, that everyone may be fully assured of the things
                        We have elucidated for thee in this manifest Tablet, which, if pressed with the hand
                        of fairness and knowledge, will yield the spirit of life for the quickening of all
                        created things. Great is the blessedness of him who swimmeth in this ocean and celebrateth
                        the praise of his Lord, the Gracious, the Best-Beloved. Indeed the breezes of divine
                        revelation are diffused from the verses of thy Lord in such wise that no one can dispute
                        its truth, except those who are bereft of hearing, of vision, of understanding and
                        of every human faculty. Verily thy Lord beareth witness unto this, yet the people
                        understand not.

                        <a id="952041849" class="brl-location"></a>This man hath said: “I am Balínús, the wise one, the performer of wonders, the producer
                        of talismans.” He surpassed everyone else in the diffusion of arts and sciences and
                        soared unto the loftiest heights of humility and supplication. Give ear unto that
                        which he hath said, entreating the  All-Possessing, the Most Exalted: “I stand in
                        the presence of my Lord, extolling His gifts and bounties and praising Him with that
                        wherewith He praiseth His Own Self, that I may become a source of blessing and guidance
                        unto such men as acknowledge my words.” And further he saith: “O Lord! Thou art God
                        and no God is there but Thee. Thou art the Creator and no creator is there except
                        Thee. Assist me by Thy grace and strengthen me. My heart is seized with alarm, my
                        limbs tremble, I have lost my reason and my mind hath failed me. Bestow upon me strength
                        and enable my tongue to speak forth with wisdom.” And still further he saith: “Thou
                        art in truth the Knowing, the Wise, the Powerful, the Compassionate.” It was this
                        man of wisdom who became informed of the mysteries of creation and discerned the subtleties
                        which lie enshrined in the Hermetic writings.<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#008274269">3</a></sup>

                        for every pronouncement an appointed time and for every situation an apt remark. Consider
                        Greece. We made it a Seat of Wisdom for a prolonged  period. However, when the appointed
                        hour struck, its throne was subverted, its tongue ceased to speak, its light grew
                        dim and its banner was hauled down. Thus do We bestow and withdraw. Verily thy Lord
                        is He Who giveth and divesteth, the Mighty, the Powerful.

                        the All-Wise. If it be Our Will We are fully capable of describing for thee whatever
                        existeth in every land or hath come to pass therein. Indeed the knowledge of thy Lord

                        of the learned. He invented an apparatus which transmitted sound over a distance of
                        sixty miles. Others besides him have also discovered things which no one in this age

                        Ponder a while that ye may perceive what My most exalted Pen hath proclaimed in this

                        were set in motion amidst mankind, to graciously aid me by Thy heavenly confirmations

                        Strengthen me then in Thy Cause in such wise that I may not be hindered by the ascendancy
                        of the oppressors among Thy creatures nor withheld by the onslaught of the disbelievers
                        amidst those who dwell in Thy realm. Make me as a lamp shining throughout Thy lands

                        sent forth a divine Messenger to revive the dispirited and despondent souls with the

                        the people with the divine purpose underlying the revelation of Books and the raising

                        of that which he doth inherently possess. Through a word proceeding out of the mouth
                        of God he was called into being; by one word more he was guided to recognize the Source
                        of his education; by yet another word his station and destiny were safeguarded. The
                        Great Being saith: Regard man as a mine rich in gems of inestimable value. Education
                        can, alone, cause it to reveal its treasures, and enable mankind to benefit therefrom.
                        If any man were to meditate on that which the Scriptures, sent down from the heaven
                        of God’s holy Will, have revealed, he would readily recognize that their purpose is
                        that all men shall be regarded as one soul, so that the seal bearing the words “The
                        Kingdom shall be God’s” may be stamped on every heart, and the light of Divine bounty,
                        of grace, and mercy may envelop all mankind. The One true God, exalted be His glory,
                        hath wished nothing for Himself. The allegiance of mankind profiteth Him not, neither
                        doth its perversity harm Him. The Bird of the Realm of Utterance voiceth continually
                        this call: “All things have I willed for thee, and thee, too, for thine own sake.”
                        If the learned and worldly-wise men of this age were to allow mankind to inhale the
                        fragrance of fellowship and love, every understanding heart would apprehend the meaning
                        of true liberty, and discover the secret of undisturbed peace and absolute composure.
                        Were the earth to attain this station and be illumined with its light it could then
                        be truly said of it: “Thou shall see in it no hollows or rising hills.”<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#828632289">1</a></sup>

                        ones! The tabernacle of unity hath been raised; regard ye not one another as strangers.
                        Ye are the fruits of one tree, and the leaves of one branch. We cherish the hope that
                        the light of justice may shine upon the world and sanctify it from tyranny. If the
                        rulers and kings of the earth, the symbols of the power of God, exalted be His glory,
                        arise and resolve to dedicate themselves to whatever will promote the highest interests
                        of the whole of humanity, the reign of justice will assuredly be established amongst
                        the children of men, and the effulgence of its light will envelop the whole earth.
                        The Great Being saith: The structure of world stability and order hath been reared
                        upon, and will continue to be sustained by, the twin pillars of reward and punishment.
                        And in another connection He hath uttered the following in the eloquent tongue:<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#984387231">4</a></sup> Justice hath a mighty force at its command. It is none other than reward and punishment
                        for the deeds of men. By the power of this force the tabernacle of order is established
                        throughout the world, causing the wicked to restrain their natures for fear of punishment.

                        <a id="750272111" class="brl-location"></a>In another passage He hath written: Take heed, O concourse of the rulers of the world!
                        There is no force on earth that can equal in its conquering power the force of justice
                        and wisdom. I, verily, affirm that there is not, and hath never been, a host more
                        mighty than that of justice and wisdom. Blessed is the king who marcheth with the
                        ensign of wisdom unfurled before him, and the battalions of justice massed in his
                        rear. He verily is the ornament that adorneth the brow of peace and the countenance
                        of security. There can be no doubt whatever that if the daystar of justice, which
                        the clouds of tyranny have obscured, were to shed its light upon men, the face of
                        the earth would be completely transformed.

                        <a id="200685474" class="brl-location"></a>The Great Being, wishing to reveal the prerequisites of the peace and tranquility
                        of the world and the advancement of its peoples, hath written: The time must come
                        when the imperative necessity for the holding of a vast, an all-embracing assemblage
                        of men will be universally realized. The rulers and kings of the earth must needs
                        attend it, and, participating in its deliberations, must consider such ways and means
                        as will lay the foundations of the world’s Great Peace amongst men. Such a peace demandeth
                        that the Great Powers should resolve, for the sake of the tranquility of the peoples
                        of the earth, to be fully reconciled among themselves. Should any king take up arms
                        against another, all should unitedly arise and prevent him. If this be done, the nations
                        of the world will no longer require any armaments, except for the purpose of preserving
                        the security of their realms and of maintaining internal order within their territories.
                        This will ensure the peace and composure of every people, government and nation. We
                        fain would hope that the kings and rulers of the earth, the mirrors of the gracious
                        and almighty name of God, may attain unto this station, and shield mankind from the
                        onslaught of tyranny.

                        <a id="635662404" class="brl-location"></a>Likewise He saith: Among the things which are conducive to unity and concord and will
                        cause the whole earth to be regarded as one country is that the diverse languages
                        be reduced to one language and in like manner the scripts used in the world be confined
                        to a single script. It is incumbent upon all nations to appoint some men of understanding
                        and erudition to convene a gathering and through joint consultation choose one language
                        from among the varied existing languages, or create a new one, to be taught to the
                        children in all the schools of the world.

                        journey, it shall be as if he were entering his own home. These things are obligatory
                        and absolutely essential. It is incumbent upon every man of insight and understanding

                        that which would direct their steps unto the path of wisdom and understanding. This
                        is the cornerstone of statesmanship and the essence thereof. From these words every
                        enlightened man of wisdom will readily perceive that which will foster such aims as
                        the welfare, security and protection of mankind and the safety of human lives. Were
                        men of insight to quaff their fill from the ocean of inner meanings which lie enshrined
                        in these words and become acquainted therewith, they would bear witness to the sublimity

                        and that of which the people are in need lie enfolded within these words. This lowly
                        servant earnestly entreateth the One true God—exalted be His glory—to illumine the
                        eyes of the people of the world with the splendor of the light of wisdom that they,

                        hath proclaimed: It is not for him to pride himself who loveth his own country, but
                        rather for him who loveth the whole world. The earth is but one country, and mankind
                        its citizens.

                        where measures are set unto everything, a station where every deserving soul shall
                        be given his due. Well is it with them that appreciate the meaning and grasp the intent

                        Faith of God and His Religion is to safeguard the interests and promote the unity
                        of the human race, and to foster the spirit of love and fellowship amongst men. Suffer

                        straight Path, the fixed and immovable foundation. Whatsoever is raised on this foundation,
                        the changes and chances of the world can never impair its strength, nor will the revolution
                        of countless centuries undermine its structure. Our hope is that the world’s religious
                        leaders and the rulers thereof will unitedly arise for the reformation of this age
                        and the rehabilitation of its fortunes. Let them, after meditating on its needs, take
                        counsel together and, through anxious and full deliberation, administer to a diseased

                        as consultation is the lamp of guidance which leadeth the way, and is the bestower

                        to man, will ensure his progress and elevate his rank. Thus the noisome odors of lawlessness
                        will be dispelled, and thus through the high endeavors of the nation’s leaders, all

                        in words alone have never been and will never be of any worth. The majority of Persia’s
                        learned doctors devote all their lives to the study of a philosophy the ultimate yield

                        However much men of understanding may favorably regard them, they will, if carried

                        <a id="539110545" class="brl-location"></a>Please God, the peoples of the world may be led, as the result of the high endeavors
                        exerted by their rulers and the wise and learned amongst men, to recognize their best
                        interests. How long will humanity persist in its waywardness? How long will injustice
                        continue? How long is chaos and confusion to reign amongst men? How long will discord
                        agitate the face of society?

                        <a id="041830557" class="brl-location"></a>This humble servant is filled with wonder, inasmuch as all men are endowed with the
                        capacity to see and hear, yet we find them deprived of the privilege of using these
                        faculties. This servant hath been prompted to pen these lines by virtue of the tender
                        love he cherisheth for thee. The winds of despair are, alas, blowing from every direction,
                        and the strife that divideth and afflicteth the human race is daily increasing. The
                        signs of impending convulsions and chaos can now be discerned, inasmuch as the prevailing
                        order appeareth to be lamentably defective. I beseech God, exalted be His glory, that
                        He may graciously awaken the peoples of the earth, may grant that the end of their
                        conduct may be profitable unto them, and aid them to accomplish that which beseemeth
                        their station.

                        <a id="319213679" class="brl-location"></a>Were man to appreciate the greatness of his station and the loftiness of his destiny
                        he would manifest naught save goodly character, pure deeds, and a seemly and praiseworthy
                        conduct. If the learned and wise men of goodwill were to impart guidance unto the
                        people, the whole earth would be regarded as one country. Verily this is the undoubted
                        truth. This servant appealeth to every diligent and enterprising soul to exert his
                        utmost endeavor and arise to rehabilitate the conditions in all regions and to quicken
                        the dead with the living waters of wisdom and utterance, by virtue of the love he
                        cherisheth for God, the One, the Peerless, the Almighty, the Beneficent.
                     </p>

                        <a id="312604489" class="brl-location"></a>No man of wisdom can demonstrate his knowledge save by means of words. This showeth
                        the significance of the Word as is affirmed in all the Scriptures, whether of former
                        times or more recently. For it is through its potency and animating spirit that the
                        people of the world have attained so eminent a position. Moreover words and utterances
                        should be both impressive and penetrating. However, no word will be infused with these
                        two qualities unless it be uttered wholly for the sake of God and with due regard
                        unto the exigencies of the occasion and the people.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="606083548" class="brl-location"></a>The Great Being saith: Human utterance is an essence which aspireth to exert its influence
                        and needeth moderation. As to its influence, this is conditional upon refinement which
                        in turn is dependent upon hearts which are detached and pure. As to its moderation,
                        this hath to be combined with tact and wisdom as prescribed in the Holy Scriptures
                        and Tablets.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="430671214" class="brl-location"></a>Every word is endowed with a spirit, therefore the speaker or expounder should carefully
                        deliver his words at the appropriate time and place, for the impression which each
                        word maketh is clearly evident and perceptible. The Great Being saith: One word may
                        be likened unto fire, another unto light, and the influence which both exert is manifest
                        in the world. Therefore an enlightened man of wisdom should primarily speak with words
                        as mild as milk, that the children of men may be nurtured and edified thereby and
                        may attain the ultimate goal of human existence which is the station of true understanding
                        and nobility. And likewise He saith: One word is like unto springtime causing the
                        tender saplings of the rose-garden of knowledge to become verdant and flourishing,
                        while another word is even as a deadly poison. It behooveth a prudent man of wisdom
                        to speak with utmost leniency and forbearance so that the sweetness of his words may
                        induce everyone to attain that which befitteth man’s station.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="242369257" class="brl-location"></a>O friend of mine! The Word of God is the king of words and its pervasive influence
                        is incalculable. It hath ever dominated and will continue to dominate the realm of
                        being. The Great Being saith: The Word is the master key for the whole world, inasmuch
                        as through its potency the doors of the hearts of men, which in reality are the doors
                        of heaven, are unlocked. No sooner had but a glimmer of its effulgent splendor shone
                        forth upon the mirror of love than the blessed word “I am the Best-Beloved” was reflected
                        therein. It is an ocean inexhaustible in riches, comprehending all things. Every thing
                        which can be perceived is but an emanation therefrom. High, immeasurably high is this
                        sublime station, in whose shadow moveth the essence of loftiness and splendor, wrapt
                        in praise and adoration.
                     </p>

                        <a id="984200422" class="brl-location"></a>Methinks people’s sense of taste hath, alas, been sorely affected by the fever of
                        negligence and folly, for they are found to be wholly unconscious and deprived of
                        the sweetness of His utterance. How regrettable indeed that man should debar himself
                        from the fruits of the tree of wisdom while his days and hours pass swiftly away.
                        Please God, the hand of divine power may safeguard all mankind and direct their steps
                        towards the horizon of true understanding.

                        be inhaled from every word thereof. Please God, this bounty may last for ever. The

                        in the presence of this Wronged One and the glances of Our loving-kindness and compassion
                        are directed towards thee.

                        and fellowship amongst men, and to revive the world and ennoble its life, they have
                        imputed such charges as the tongue and the pen are ashamed to recount.

                        the Lord of Mankind, the Possessor of the Throne on High and of the world below. No

                        for when occupied with work one is less likely to dwell on the unpleasant aspects
                        of life. God willing thou mayest experience joy and radiance, gladness and exultation

                        He may vouchsafe divine assistance and grant confirmation in that which is pleasing
                        and acceptable unto Him.

                        Indeed the actions of man himself breed a profusion of satanic power. For were men
                        to abide by and observe the divine teachings, every trace of evil would be banished
                        from the face of the earth. However, the widespread differences that exist among mankind
                        and the prevalence of sedition, contention, conflict and the like are the primary
                        factors which provoke the appearance of the satanic spirit. Yet the Holy Spirit hath
                        ever shunned such matters. A world in which naught can be perceived save strife, quarrels
                        and corruption is bound to become the seat of the throne, the very metropolis, of
                        Satan.

                        the souls that have melted in their separation from Thy loved ones, and by the hearts
                        broken for the exaltation of Thy Word, to grant that the dwellers of Thy realm may
                        unite together in their allegiance to Thine incomparable Word so that they may all
                        acknowledge Thy unity and Thy oneness. There is no God but Thee, the Omnipotent, the

                        and His Testament at a time when all men have violated it and have repudiated the
                        One in Whom they had believed, and this notwithstanding that He hath appeared invested
                        with every testimony, and hath dawned from the horizon of Revelation clothed with
                        undoubted sovereignty.

                        <a id="421904300" class="brl-location"></a>It behooveth thee, however, to exert thine utmost to attain the very essence of fidelity.
                        This implieth to be well assured in thy heart and to testify with thy tongue to that
                        whereunto God hath testified for His Own exalted Self, proclaiming: “Verily, self-subsisting
                        am I within the Realm of Glory.” Whoso is enabled in these days to solemnly affirm
                        this truth, hath attained unto all good, and the heavenly Spirit shall descend upon
                        him in the daytime and in the night season, shall graciously assist him to glorify
                        the Name of his Lord and suffer him to unloose his tongue and uphold with his words
                        the Cause of his Lord, the Merciful, the Compassionate. And none can ever achieve
                        this except he who hath purged his heart from whatsoever is created between heaven
                        and earth, and hath entirely detached himself from all but God, the sovereign Lord,
                        the Almighty, the Gracious.

                        all things. Amongst the Concourse on High He is known as the Most Great Announcement
                        and in the Realms of Eternity as the Ancient Beauty, and before the Throne by this
                        Name<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#600496407">2</a></sup> which hath caused the footsteps of them that are endued with understanding to slip.

                        <a id="823205735" class="brl-location"></a>Say, I swear by God! In this Revelation even before a single verse was sent down from
                        the realm of holiness and sublimity, the supreme testimony of God had been fulfilled
                        for all the inmates of heaven and the dwellers on earth; moreover, We have revealed
                        the equivalent of whatsoever was sent down in the Dispensation of the Bayán. Fear
                        ye God and suffer not your deeds to be rendered vain and be not of them that are sunk
                        in heedlessness. Open your eyes that ye may behold the Ancient Beauty from this shining

                        the Omnipotent, the Almighty. Thereupon the footsteps of everyone have slipped except
                        such as God hath protected through His tender mercy and numbered with those who have
                        recognized Him through His Own Self and detached themselves from all that pertaineth
                        to the world.

                        <a id="007310572" class="brl-location"></a>Hearken thou unto the Words of thy Lord and purify thy heart from every illusion so
                        that the effulgent light of the remembrance of thy Lord may shed its radiance upon
                        it, and it may attain the station of certitude.

                        its contents. We noted the questions thou hast asked and will readily answer thee.
                        It behooveth everyone in this Day to ask God that which he desireth, and thy Lord
                        will heed his petition with wondrous and undeniable verses.

                        <a id="101224547" class="brl-location"></a>Thou hast asked regarding the subject of the return. Know thou that the end is like
                        unto the beginning. Even as thou dost consider the beginning, similarly shouldst thou
                        consider the end, and be of them that truly perceive. Nay, rather consider the beginning
                        as the end itself, and so conversely, that thou mayest acquire a clear perception.
                        Know thou moreover that every created thing is continually brought forth and returned
                        at the bidding of thy Lord, the God of power and might.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="048284555" class="brl-location"></a>As to the Return, as God hath purposed in His sacred and exalted Tablets wherein He
                        hath made this theme known unto His servants; by this is meant the return of all created
                        things in the Day of Resurrection, and this is indeed the essence of the Return as
                        thou hast witnessed in God’s own days and thou art of them that testify to this truth.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="418203425" class="brl-location"></a>Verily God is fully capable of causing all names to appear in one name, and all souls
                        in one soul. Surely powerful and mighty is He. And this Return is realized at His
                        behest in whatever form He willeth. Indeed He is the One Who doeth and ordaineth all
                        things. Moreover, thou shouldst not perceive the fulfillment of the Return and the
                        Resurrection save in the Word of thy Lord, the Almighty, the All-Knowing. For instance,
                        were He to take a handful of earth and declare it to be the One Whom ye have been
                        following in the past, it would undoubtedly be just and true, even as His real Person,
                        and to none is given the right to question His authority. He doeth what He willeth
                        and ordaineth whatsoever He pleaseth. Moreover, in this station take thou heed not
                        to turn thy gaze unto limitations and allusions, but rather unto that whereby the
                        Revelation itself hath been fulfilled and be of them that are discerning. Thus do
                        We explain for thee in a lucid and explicit language that thou mayest comprehend that
                        which thou didst seek from thine ancient Lord.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="840450480" class="brl-location"></a>Consider thou the Day of Resurrection. Were God to pronounce the lowliest of creatures
                        among the faithful to be the First One to believe in the Bayán, thou shouldst have
                        no misgivings about it and must be of them that truly believe. In this station look
                        not upon human limitations and names but rather upon that whereby the rank of the
                        First One to believe is vindicated, which is faith in God, and recognition of His
                        Being and assurance in the fulfillment of His irresistible and binding command.
                     </p>

                        <a id="829250806" class="brl-location"></a>Consider thou the Revelation of the Point of the Bayán—exalted is His glory. He pronounced
                        the First One<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#763169071">3</a></sup> to believe in Him to be Muḥammad, the Messenger of God. Doth it beseem a man to dispute
                        with Him by saying that this man is from Persia, the Other from Arabia, or this one
                        was called Ḥusayn while the Other bore the name of Muḥammad? Nay, I swear by God’s
                        holy Being, the Exalted, the Most Great. Surely no man of intelligence and insight
                        would ever pay attention unto limitations or names, but rather unto that with which
                        Muḥammad was invested, which was none other than the Cause of God. Such a man of insight
                        would likewise consider Ḥusayn and the position he occupied in the Cause of God, the
                        Omnipotent, the Exalted, the Knowing, the Wise. And since the First One to believe
                        in God in the Dispensation of the Bayán was invested with command similar to that
                        with which Muḥammad, the Messenger of God, was invested, therefore the Báb pronounced
                        him to be the latter, namely His return and resurrection. This station is sanctified
                        from every limitation or name, and naught can be seen therein but God, the One, the
                        Peerless, the All-Knowing.

                        <a id="811046014" class="brl-location"></a>Know thou moreover that in the Day of Revelation were He to pronounce one of the leaves
                        to be the manifestation of all His excellent titles, unto no one is given the right
                        to utter why or wherefore, and should one do so he would be regarded as a disbeliever
                        in God and be numbered with such as have repudiated His Truth.

                        <a id="742898607" class="brl-location"></a>Beware, beware lest thou behave like unto the people of the Bayán. For indeed they
                        erred grievously, misguided the people, ignored the Covenant of God and His Testament
                        and joined partners with Him, the One, the Incomparable, the All-Knowing. Verily they
                        failed to recognize the Point of the Bayán, for had they recognized Him they would
                        not have rejected His manifestation in this luminous and resplendent Being. And since
                        they fixed their eyes on names, therefore when He replaced His Name “the Most Exalted”
                        by “the Most Glorious” their eyes were dimmed. They have failed to recognize Him in
                        these days and are reckoned with those that perish. Indeed, had they known Him through
                        His own Self or by virtue of that which He hath revealed, they would not have repudiated
                        Him when He appeared in this glorious and incomparable Name, which God hath ordained
                        to be the Sword of His Revelation between heaven and earth, and through which truth
                        is separated from error, even from now until the Day when mankind shall stand before
                        the Lord of the worlds.

                        <a id="953517294" class="brl-location"></a>Know thou moreover that in the Day of His Manifestation all things besides God shall
                        be brought forth and placed equally, irrespective of their rank being high or low.
                        The Day of Return is inscrutable unto all men until after the divine Revelation hath
                        been fulfilled. He is in truth the One Who ordaineth whatsoever He willeth. When the
                        Word of God is revealed unto all created things whoso then giveth ear and heedeth
                        the Call is, indeed, reckoned among the most distinguished souls, though he be a carrier
                        of ashes. And he who turneth away is accounted as the lowliest of His servants, though
                        he be a ruler amongst men and the possessor of all the books that are in the heavens
                        and on earth.

                        <a id="895643160" class="brl-location"></a>It behooveth thee to look with divine insight upon the things We have revealed and
                        sent unto thee and not towards the people and that which is current amongst them.
                        They are in this day like unto a blind man who, while moving in the sunshine, demandeth:
                        Where is the sun? Is it shining? He would deny and dispute the truth, and would not
                        be of them that perceive. Never shall he be able to discern the sun or to understand
                        that which hath intervened between him and it. He would object within himself, voice
                        protests, and would be among the rebellious. Such is the state of this people. Leave
                        them unto themselves, saying: Unto you be that which ye desire and unto us that which
                        we desire. Wretched indeed is the plight of the ungodly.
                     </p>

                        <a id="150396775" class="brl-location"></a>Know thou moreover that the former Manifestation affirmed that the return and rising
                        of the spirits would occur on the Day of Resurrection, while in truth there is a return
                        and resurrection for every created thing. However We do not wish to mention aught
                        that is not set forth in the Bayán, lest perchance the people of malice raise a great
                        outcry. O would that that which interveneth between the children of men and their
                        Creator were dispelled that they might be enabled to behold God’s invincible sovereignty
                        and dominion, quaff from the wellspring of His heavenly streams, be sprinkled with
                        the outpourings of the ocean of true understanding and be purged from the defilements
                        of the ungodly and the suspicious.

                        <a id="861851575" class="brl-location"></a>As to thy question concerning the worlds of God. Know thou of a truth that the worlds
                        of God are countless in their number, and infinite in their range. None can reckon
                        or comprehend them except God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Consider thy state when
                        asleep. Verily, I say, this phenomenon is the most mysterious of the signs of God
                        amongst men, were they to ponder it in their hearts. Behold how the thing which thou
                        hast seen in thy dream is, after a considerable lapse of time, fully realized. Had
                        the world in which thou didst find thyself in thy dream been identical with the world
                        in which thou livest, it would have been necessary for the event occurring in that
                        dream to have transpired in this world at the very moment of its occurrence. Were
                        it so, you yourself would have borne witness unto it. This being not the case, however,
                        it must necessarily follow that the world in which thou livest is different and apart
                        from that which thou hast experienced in thy dream. This latter world hath neither
                        beginning nor end. It would be true if thou wert to contend that this same world is,
                        as decreed by the All-Glorious and Almighty God, within thy proper self and is wrapped
                        up within thee. It would equally be true to maintain that thy spirit, having transcended
                        the limitations of sleep and having stripped itself of all earthly attachment, hath,
                        by the act of God, been made to traverse a realm which lieth hidden in the innermost
                        reality of this world. Verily I say, the creation of God embraceth worlds besides
                        this world, and creatures apart from these creatures. In each of these worlds He hath
                        ordained things which none can search except Himself, the All-Searching, the All-Wise.
                        Do thou meditate on that which We have revealed unto thee, that thou mayest discover
                        the purpose of God, thy Lord, and the Lord of all worlds. In these words the mysteries
                        of Divine Wisdom have been treasured. We have refrained from dwelling upon this theme
                        owing to the sorrow that hath encompassed Us from the actions of them that have been
                        created through Our words, if ye be of them that will hearken unto Our Voice.

                        Say, implore God to open to your hearts the portals of true understanding that ye
                        may be apprised of that of which no one is apprised. Verily, He is the Giver, the
                        Forgiving, the Compassionate.

                        <a id="213345856" class="brl-location"></a>Thou hast moreover asked Me concerning the ordinances of God. Know thou of a truth
                        that whatsoever hath been prescribed in the Book is indeed the truth, no doubt is
                        there about it, and it is incumbent upon everyone to observe that which hath been
                        sent down by Him Who is the Revealer, the All-Knowing. Were a man to put them away
                        despite his being aware thereof, God would truly be clear of such a one and We too
                        would be clear of him, inasmuch as His ordinances constitute the fruits of the divine
                        Tree and none other than the heedless and the wayward will deviate therefrom.

                        <a id="064103002" class="brl-location"></a>As to Paradise: It is a reality and there can be no doubt about it, and now in this
                        world it is realized through love of Me and My good-pleasure. Whosoever attaineth
                        unto it God will aid him in this world below, and after death He will enable him to
                        gain admittance into Paradise whose vastness is as that of heaven and earth. Therein
                        the Maids of glory and holiness will wait upon him in the daytime and in the night
                        season, while the daystar of the unfading beauty of his Lord will at all times shed
                        its radiance upon him and he will shine so brightly that no one shall bear to gaze
                        at him. Such is the dispensation of Providence, yet the people are shut out by a grievous
                        veil. Likewise apprehend thou the nature of hell-fire and be of them that truly believe.
                        For every act performed there shall be a recompense according to the estimate of God,
                        and unto this the very ordinances and prohibitions prescribed by the Almighty amply
                        bear witness. For surely if deeds were not rewarded and yielded no fruit, then the
                        Cause of God—exalted is He—would prove futile. Immeasurably high is He exalted above
                        such blasphemies! However, unto them that are rid of all attachments a deed is, verily,
                        its own reward. Were We to enlarge upon this theme numerous Tablets would need to
                        be written.

                        in the mountains. However, since Our loving providence surpasseth all things, We have
                        ordained that complete victory should be achieved through speech and utterance, that
                        Our servants throughout the earth may thereby become the recipients of divine good.
                        This is but a token of God’s bounty vouchsafed unto them. Verily thy Lord is the All-Sufficing,
                        the Most Exalted.

                        in honor of Nabíl of Qá’in,<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#511038023">2</a></sup> he would readily comprehend the significance of assistance: Human utterance is an
                        essence which aspireth to exert its influence and needeth moderation. As to its influence,
                        this is conditional upon refinement, which in turn is dependent upon hearts which
                        are detached and pure. As to its moderation, this hath to be combined with tact and
                        wisdom as prescribed in the Holy Scriptures and Tablets.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="438743487" class="brl-location"></a>O My Name! Utterance must needs possess penetrating power. For if bereft of this quality
                        it would fail to exert influence. And this penetrating influence dependeth on the
                        spirit being pure and the heart stainless. Likewise it needeth moderation, without
                        which the hearer would be unable to bear it, rather he would manifest opposition from
                        the very outset. And moderation will be obtained by blending utterance with the tokens
                        of divine wisdom which are recorded in the sacred Books and Tablets. Thus when the
                        essence of one’s utterance is endowed with these two requisites it will prove highly
                        effective and will be the prime factor in transforming the souls of men. This is the
                        station of supreme victory and celestial dominion. Whoso attaineth thereto is invested
                        with the power to teach the Cause of God and to prevail over the hearts and minds
                        of men.

                        Revelation, hath so illumined the Scrolls and Tablets that the kingdom of utterance

                        upon them, one and all, to diligently seek ways to help the Cause of God in such manner
                        as We have explained. This is but a token of His grace especially conferred upon His
                        loved ones that every one of them may attain the station characterized by the words:

                        Its appointed hour is preordained in the Book of God. He is truly cognizant thereof

                        speech they may recite divine verses whenever the occasion demandeth it, inasmuch
                        as these holy verses are the most potent elixir, the greatest and mightiest talisman.
                        So potent is their influence that the hearer will have no cause for vacillation. I
                        swear by My life! This Revelation is endowed with such a power that it will act as
                        the lodestone for all nations and kindreds of the earth. Should one pause to meditate
                        attentively he would recognize that no place is there, nor can there be, for anyone
                        to flee to.

                        pronounced sentence against them for whom the books of the world have wept, and in
                        whose favor the scriptures of all religions have testified. Thou, who art gone far
                        astray, art indeed wrapt in a thick veil. By God Himself! Thou hast pronounced judgment

                        with a justice which turned into light the darkness of the earth, and enraptured the

                        the Incomparable, the All-Informed. O heedless one! Hearken unto that which the Merciful
                        hath revealed in the Qur’án: “Say not to every one who meeteth you with a greeting,
                        ‘Thou art not a believer.’”<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#132859394">4</a></sup> Thus hath He decreed in Whose grasp are the kingdoms of Revelation and of creation,
                        if thou be of them that hearken. Thou hast set aside the commandment of God, and clung
                        unto the promptings of thine own desire. Woe, then, unto thee, O careless one that
                        doubtest! If thou deniest Me, by what proof canst thou vindicate the truth of that
                        which thou dost possess? Produce it, then, O thou who hast joined partners with God,
                        and turned aside from His sovereignty that hath encompassed the worlds!

                        <a id="288594249" class="brl-location"></a>O foolish one! Know thou that he is truly learned who hath acknowledged My Revelation,
                        and drunk from the Ocean of My knowledge, and soared in the atmosphere of My love,
                        and cast away all else besides Me, and taken firm hold on that which hath been sent
                        down from the Kingdom of My wondrous utterance. He, verily, is even as an eye unto
                        mankind, and as the spirit of life unto the body of all creation. Glorified be the
                        All-Merciful Who hath enlightened him, and caused him to arise and serve His great
                        and mighty Cause. Verily, such a man is blessed by the Concourse on high, and by them
                        who dwell within the Tabernacle of Grandeur, who have quaffed My sealed Wine in My
                        Name, the Omnipotent, the All-Powerful. O Báqir! If thou be of them that occupy such
                        a sublime station, produce then a sign from God, the Creator of the heavens. And shouldst
                        thou recognize thy powerlessness, do thou rein in thy passions, and return unto thy
                        Lord, that perchance He may forgive thee thy sins which have caused the leaves of
                        the Divine Lote-Tree to be burnt up, and the Rock to cry out, and the eyes of men
                        of understanding to weep. Because of thee the Veil of Divinity was rent asunder, and
                        the Ark foundered, and the She-Camel was hamstrung, and the Spirit<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#747976006">5</a></sup> groaned in His sublime retreat. Disputest thou with Him Who hath come unto thee with
                        the testimonies of God and His signs which thou possessest and which are in the possession
                        of them that dwell on earth? Open thine eyes that thou mayest behold this Wronged
                        One shining forth above the horizon of the will of God, the Sovereign, the Truth,
                        the Resplendent. Unstop, then, the ear of thine heart that thou mayest hearken unto
                        the speech of the Divine Lote-Tree that hath been raised up in truth by God, the Almighty,
                        the Beneficent. Verily, this Tree, notwithstanding the things that befell it by reason
                        of thy cruelty and of the transgressions of such as are like thee, calleth aloud and
                        summoneth all men unto the Sadratu’l-Muntahá<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#175043806">6</a></sup> and the Supreme Horizon. Blessed is the soul that hath gazed on the Most Mighty Sign,
                        and the ear that hath heard His most sweet Voice, and woe to whosoever hath turned
                        aside and done wickedly.

                        and its branches, and its leaves, notwithstanding that God created thee for the purpose
                        of recognizing and of serving it. Reflect, that haply thou mayest recognize thine
                        iniquity and be numbered with such as have repented. Thinkest thou that We fear thy
                        cruelty? Know thou and be well assured that from the first day whereon the voice of
                        the Most Sublime Pen was raised betwixt earth and heaven We offered up Our souls,
                        and Our bodies, and Our sons, and Our possessions in the path of God, the Exalted,
                        the Great, and We glory therein amongst all created things and the Concourse on high.
                        Unto this testify the things which have befallen Us in this straight Path. By God!
                        Our hearts were consumed, and Our bodies were crucified, and Our blood was spilt,
                        while Our eyes were fixed on the horizon of the loving-kindness of their Lord, the
                        Witness, the All-Seeing. The more grievous their woes, the greater waxed the love
                        of the people of Bahá. Unto their sincerity hath borne witness what the All-Merciful
                        hath sent down in the Qur’án. He saith: “Wish ye, then, for death, if ye are sincere.”<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#758027439">7</a></sup> Who is to be preferred, he that hath sheltered himself behind curtains, or he that
                        hath offered himself in the path of God? Judge thou fairly, and be not of them that
                        rove distraught in the wilderness of falsehood. So carried away have they been by
                        the living waters of the love of the Most Merciful, that neither the arms of the world
                        nor the swords of the nations have deterred them from setting their faces towards
                        the ocean of the bounty of their Lord, the Giver, the Generous.

                        Him Whom God hath made to be the Repository of His Revelation, if thou be of them
                        that comprehend. Woe betide thee, O thou who hast joined partners with God, and woe
                        betide them that have taken thee as their leader, without a clear token or a perspicuous
                        Book. How numerous the oppressors before thee who have arisen to quench the light
                        of God, and how many the impious who murdered and pillaged until the hearts and souls
                        of men groaned by reason of their cruelty! The sun of justice hath been obscured,
                        inasmuch as the embodiment of tyranny hath been stablished upon the throne of hatred,
                        and yet the people understand not. The children of the Apostle have been slain and
                        their possessions pillaged. Say: Was it, in thine estimation, their possessions or
                        themselves that denied God? Judge fairly, O ignorant one that hath been shut out as
                        by a veil from God. Thou hast clung to tyranny and cast away justice; whereupon all
                        created things have lamented, and still thou art among the wayward. Thou hast put
                        to death the aged, and plundered the young. Thinkest thou that thou wilt consume that
                        which thine iniquity hath amassed? Nay, by Myself! Thus informeth thee He Who is cognizant
                        of all. By God! The things thou possessest shall profit thee not, nor what thou hast
                        laid up through thy cruelty. Unto this beareth witness Thy Lord, the All-Knowing.
                        Thou hast arisen to put out the light of this Cause; ere long will thine own fire
                        be quenched, at His behest. He, verily, is the Lord of strength and of might. The
                        changes and chances of the world, and the powers of the nations, cannot frustrate
                        Him. He doeth what He pleaseth, and ordaineth what He willeth through the power of
                        His sovereignty. Consider the she-camel. Though but a beast, yet hath the All-Merciful
                        exalted her to so high a station that the tongues of the earth made mention of her
                        and celebrated her praise. He, verily, overshadoweth all that is in the heavens and
                        on earth. No God is there but Him, the Almighty, the Great. Thus have We adorned the
                        heaven of Our Tablet with the suns of Our words. Blessed the man that hath attained
                        thereunto and been illumined with their light, and woe betide such as have turned
                        aside, and denied Him, and strayed far from Him. Praised be God, the Lord of the worlds!

                        is right. Verily I say, the tongue is for mentioning what is good, defile it not with
                        unseemly talk. God hath forgiven what is past. Henceforward everyone  should utter
                        that which is meet and seemly, and should refrain from slander, abuse and whatever
                        causeth sadness in men. Lofty is the station of man! Not long ago this exalted Word

                        firm and steadfast in the Cause. In the eyes of the All-Merciful a true man appeareth
                        even as a firmament; its sun and moon are his sight and hearing, and his shining and
                        resplendent character its stars. His is the loftiest station, and his influence educateth

                        Branch. Consider that which We have revealed in Our Most Holy Book: “When the ocean
                        of My presence hath ebbed and the Book of My Revelation is ended, turn your faces
                        towards Him Whom God hath purposed, Who hath branched from this Ancient Root.” The
                        object of this sacred verse is none except the Most Mighty Branch [‘Abdu’l‑Bahá].
                        Thus have We graciously revealed unto you Our potent Will, and I am verily the Gracious,
                        the All-Bountiful.  Verily God hath ordained the station of the Greater Branch [Muḥammad
                        ‘Alí] to be beneath that of the Most Great Branch [‘Abdu’l‑Bahá]. He is in truth the
                        Ordainer, the All-Wise. We have chosen “the Greater” after “the Most Great,” as decreed

                        I say, fear of God is the greatest commander that can render the Cause of God victorious,
                        and the hosts which best befit this commander have ever been and are an upright character

                           through the potency of Thy behest which pervadeth the entire creation.

                           <span class="brl-uppercase">O Friend</span>! In the Bayán We directed everyone in this Most Great Revelation to see with his
                           own eyes and hear with his own ears. However when the horizon of the world was illumined
                           with the resplendent light of this Revelation, many people forgot this divine commandment,
                           lost sight of this heavenly exhortation and immersed themselves in the vain imaginings
                           which their minds had devised. Indeed the face of the sun of justice and fairness
                           is hidden behind the clouds of idle fancy which the foolish ones have conceived. Therefore
                           it is not to be wondered at that the movements of the birds of darkness attract attention.
                           Through the potency of the Name of the Best-Beloved, invite thou the receptive souls
                           unto God’s holy court, that perchance they may not remain deprived of the heavenly
                           Fountain of living water. He is in truth the Gracious, the Forgiving.

                           and all heavenly Scriptures bear evidence to its overpowering majesty. In this Day
                           the Book solemnly testifieth to His glory and the Balance is moved to lift up its
                           voice. This is the Day wherein the Ṣiraṭ calleth aloud: “I am the straight Path,”
                           and Mount Sinai exclaimeth: “Verily the Lord of Revelation is come.”

                           The accumulations of vain fancy have obstructed men’s ears and stopped them from hearing

                           recent times pale into lowliness and insignificance—and set their hearts on lying

                           is well aware of the feeling of joy which His love hath roused in thy heart and of
                           thy pangs of anguish at that which hath befallen His loved ones. I swear by the Lord
                           of mercy! The whole world is overwhelmed with sorrow whilst mankind is perplexed with
                           doubts and dissensions. The people of God, the Lord of Names, are so grievously beset
                           by enemies that the supreme Paradise hath lamented and the inmates of highest Heaven
                           and those who, day and night, circle round the Throne have groaned aloud.

                           He hath risen to champion the Cause of God in such wise that neither the overpowering
                           might of the world nor the tyranny of the nations can ever alarm Him. He calleth aloud
                           betwixt earth and heaven, saying: The Promised Day is come. The Lord of creation proclaimeth:
                           Verily, there is no God besides Me, the Almighty, the All-Bountiful.

                           by their acts the flame in the Burning Bush. Say, wretched indeed is your plight,
                           O ye embodiments of delusion. Fear ye God and reject not the heavenly grace which
                           hath shed radiance upon all regions. Say, He Who is the Exponent of the hidden Name
                           hath appeared, did ye but know it. He Whose advent hath been foretold in the heavenly
                           Scriptures is come, could ye but understand it. The world’s horizon is illumined by
                           the splendors of this Most Great Revelation. Haste ye with radiant hearts and be not

                           is laid low. Unto this bear witness the honored servants of God.

                           heavens and on the earth have swooned away except such as have detached themselves
                           from the world, cleaving fast unto the Cord of God, the Lord of mankind. This is the
                           Day in which the earth shineth with the effulgent light of thy Lord, but the people
                           are lost in error and have been shut out as by a veil. We desire to regenerate the
                           world, yet they have resolved to put an end to My life. Thus have their hearts prompted
                           them in this Day—a Day which hath been made bright by the radiant light of the countenance
                           of its Lord, the Omnipotent, the Almighty, the Unconstrained. The Mother Book hath
                           lifted up its Voice, but the people are bereft of hearing. The Preserved Tablet hath
                           been revealed with truth, yet the generality of mankind peruse it not. They have denied
                           the gracious favor of God after it hath been sent down unto them and have turned away
                           from God, the Knower of things unseen. They firmly cling to the hem of idle fancies,
                           turning their backs on the hidden Name of the Almighty.

                           raised up in truth at the behest of God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting. I

                           been cast by the hosts of tyranny. Know ye of a certainty that He will render you

                           high rank before the gaze of all nations. Surely He will not suffer the reward of

                           One and We have revealed for thee that with which none of the books of the world can
                           compare. Unto this beareth witness the King of eternity; yet the generality of mankind
                           are numbered among the heedless. From the dawning-place of testimony We have raised
                           the Call unto all that dwell in the realm of creation. Amongst men there are those
                           who have been carried away by the fragrance of the utterance of their Lord in such
                           manner that they have forsaken everything which pertaineth unto men in their eagerness
                           to attain the court of the presence of God, the Lord of the mighty throne. There are
                           also those who are sore perplexed and wavering. Others have made haste, winged their
                           way to answer the Call of their Lord, the Ancient of Days. Still others have turned
                           aside, rejected the truth and eventually disbelieved in God, the Almighty, the All-Praised.
                           And there are yet others who have pronounced judgment against Him with such cruelty
                           that every wise and discerning soul hath been moved to lament. We have graciously
                           summoned them unto the river that is life indeed, while they have, with manifest injustice,
                           decreed the shedding of My blood. Thus hath the Daystar of wisdom shone forth from
                           above the horizon of the utterance of thy Lord, the All-Merciful. Shouldst thou attain
                           unto its light, it behooveth thee to magnify the praise of thy Lord and say, I yield
                           Thee thanks, O God of the worlds.

                           by recognizing that which Our Pen of Glory hath revealed.

                           highly essential, inasmuch as this theme hath been set forth in numerous Tablets revealed

                           The fruits of the human tree are exquisite, highly desired and dearly cherished. Among
                           them are upright character, virtuous deeds and a goodly utterance. The springtime
                           for earthly trees occurreth once every year, while the one for human trees appeareth

                           ask repeatedly: “What is that Word which the Qá’im will pronounce whereby the leaders
                           of religion are put to flight?” Say, that Word is now made manifest and ye have fled
                           ere ye heard it uttered, although ye perceive it not. And that blessed, that hidden,
                           that concealed and treasured Word is this: “‘HE’ hath now appeared in the raiment
                           of ‘I.’ He Who was hidden from mortal eyes exclaimeth: Lo! I am the All-Manifest.”
                           This is the Word which hath caused the limbs of disbelievers to quake. Glorified be
                           God! All the heavenly Scriptures of the past attest to the greatness of this Day,
                           the greatness of this Manifestation, the greatness of His signs, the greatness of

                           Yet despite all this the people have remained heedless and are shut out as by a veil.
                           Indeed all the Prophets have yearned to attain this Day. David saith: “Who will bring

                           this most wondrous utterance. By the righteousness of God! If thou wert present before
                           My Throne and didst hearken unto the Tongue of might and grandeur, thou wouldst sacrifice
                           thy body, thy soul, thine entire being as a token of thy love for God, the Sovereign,
                           the Protector, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise, and wouldst so thrill to the fascination
                           of His Voice that every pen would be powerless to recount thy station and every eloquent
                           speaker would be confounded in his attempt to describe it. Ponder a while concerning
                           this Revelation and its invincible sovereignty; aid it then as it beseemeth thy Lord,
                           the Gracious, the All-Bountiful. Direct thou the people unto the Dayspring of glory.
                           Verily it is He Himself Who is established upon His mighty Throne. Through Him hath
                           the horizon of this Prison been made to shine and by Him have all that are in the
                           heavens and on the earth been illumined.

                           the sheep of Jethro, His father-in-law. He hearkened unto the Voice of the Lord of
                           mankind coming from the Burning Bush which had been raised above the Holy Land, exclaiming,
                           “O Moses! Verily I am God, thy Lord and the Lord of thy forefathers, Abraham, Isaac
                           and Jacob.” He was so carried away by the captivating accent of the Voice that He
                           detached Himself from the world and set out in the direction of Pharaoh and his people,
                           invested with the power of thy Lord Who exerciseth sovereignty over all that hath
                           been and shall be. The people of the world are now hearing that which Moses did hear,

                           Thee and hath placed his whole reliance in Thee. I implore Thee by Thy Name whereby
                           the ocean of Thine utterance hath surged and the breezes of Thy knowledge have stirred,
                           to grant that I may be graciously aided to serve Thy Cause and be inspired to remember
                           Thee and praise Thee. Send down then upon me from the heaven of Thy generosity that
                           which will preserve me from anyone but Thee and will profit me in all Thy worlds.

                     <a id="918842320" class="brl-location"></a>Wherever possible, translations made by Shoghi Effendi have been used in preparing
                     this book. In many instances his renderings of individual phrases have been incorporated,
                     but these are too numerous to list. Below are listed two categories of translation
                     that have been used. One is a direct translation of the actual Tablet concerned, or
                     of excerpts therefrom. The second category is slightly less direct: in a number of
                     His later Writings Bahá’u’lláh used to quote passages from His own Tablets, but when
                     doing so He often modified the passage from which He was quoting. Thus, when Shoghi
                     Effendi’s translations of such quoted passages—as, for example, in the <em>Epistle to the Son of the Wolf</em>—have been used, they have had to be adjusted to agree with the passage as it appeared
                     in the Tablet from which Bahá’u’lláh was quoting, as it is these original Tablets
                     that are here translated. Such adjustments are slight and have not been specially
                     noted, but will be apparent to anyone who compares the passages as they appear in
                     this book with the volumes from which Shoghi Effendi’s translations are taken.

                                       from the Hermetic Tablets and most of the philosophers who followed him made their
                                       philosophical and scientific discoveries from his words and statements.…” In the Qur’án,
                                       Súra 19, verses 57 and 58, is written: “And commemorate Idrís in the Book; for he
