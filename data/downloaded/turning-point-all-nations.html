                        in state sovereignty is moving towards a climax. A world, growing to maturity, must
                        abandon this fetish, recognize the oneness and wholeness of human relationships, and
                        establish once for all the machinery that can best incarnate this fundamental principle

                           <a id="226711409" class="brl-location"></a>The 20th Century, one of the most tumultuous periods in human history, has been marked
                           by numerous upheavals, revolutions and radical departures from the past. Ranging from
                           the collapse of the colonial system and the great nineteenth century empires to the
                           rise and fall of broad and disastrous experiments with totalitarianism, fascism and
                           communism, some of these upheavals have been extremely destructive, involving the
                           deaths of millions, the eradication of old lifestyles and traditions, and the collapse
                           of time-honored institutions.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <a id="996779977" class="brl-location"></a>Other movements and trends have been more obviously positive. Scientific discoveries
                           and new social insights have spurred many progressive social, economic and cultural
                           transformations. The way has been cleared for new definitions of human rights and
                           affirmations of personal dignity, expanded opportunities for individual and collective
                           achievement, and bold new avenues for the advancement of human knowledge and consciousness.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <a id="890369525" class="brl-location"></a>These twin processes—the collapse of old institutions on the one hand and the blossoming
                           of new ways of thinking on the other—are evidence of a single trend which has been
                           gaining momentum during the last hundred years: the trend toward ever-increasing interdependence
                           and integration of humanity.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <a id="293986742" class="brl-location"></a>This trend is observable in wide-ranging phenomena, from the fusion of world financial
                           markets, which in turn reflect humanity’s reliance on diverse and interdependent sources
                           of energy, food, raw materials, technology and knowledge, to the construction of globe-girdling
                           systems of communications and transportation. It is reflected in the scientific understanding
                           of the earth’s interconnected biosphere, which has in turn given a new urgency to
                           the need for global coordination. It is manifest, albeit in a destructive way, in
                           the capacities of modern weapons systems, which have gradually increased in power
                           to the point where it is now possible for a handful of men to bring an end to human
                           civilization itself. It is the universal consciousness of this trend—in both its constructive
                           and destructive expressions—that lends such poignancy to the familiar photograph of
                           the earth as a swirling sphere of blue and white against the infinite blackness of
                           space, an image crystallizing the realization that we are a single people, rich in
                           diversity, living in a common homeland.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <a id="417428611" class="brl-location"></a>This trend is reflected, too, in steady efforts by the nations of the world to forge
                           a world political system that can secure for humanity the possibility of peace, justice
                           and prosperity. Twice in this century humanity has attempted to bring about a new
                           international order. Each attempt sought to address the emergent recognition of global
                           interdependence, while nevertheless preserving intact a system which put the sovereignty
                           of the state above all else. In the perspective of the century now ending, the League
                           of Nations, a breakthrough in the concept of collective security, marked a first decisive
                           step toward world order.

                           <a id="194521197" class="brl-location"></a>The second effort, born from the cataclysm of World War II and based on a Charter
                           drawn up principally by the victors of that conflagration, has for fifty years provided
                           an international forum of last resort, a unique institution standing as a noble symbol
                           for the collective interests of humanity as a whole.

                           <a id="024256589" class="brl-location"></a>As an international organization, the United Nations has demonstrated humanity’s capacity
                           for united action in health, agriculture, education, environmental protection, and
                           the welfare of children. It has affirmed our collective moral will to build a better
                           future, evinced in the widespread adoption of international human rights Covenants.
                           It has revealed the human race’s deep-seated compassion, evidenced by the devotion
                           of financial and human resources to the assistance of people in distress. And in the
                           all-important realms of peace-building, peace-making and peace-keeping, the United
                           Nations has blazed a bold path toward a future without war.<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#086906826">1</a></sup>

                           Despite the high hopes of its founders, the establishment of the United Nations some
                           fifty years ago did not usher in an era of peace and prosperity for all.⁠<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#068510109">2</a></sup>

                           regional conflicts costing millions of lives. No sooner had improved relations between
                           the superpowers removed the ideological motivation for such conflicts, than long-smoldering
                           ethnic and sectarian passions surfaced as a new source of conflagration. In addition,
                           although the end of the Cold War has reduced the threat of a global, terminal war,
                           there remain instruments and technologies—and to some extent the underlying passions—which
                           could bring about planet-wide destruction.

                           <a id="499718608" class="brl-location"></a>With respect to social issues, likewise, grave problems persist. While new levels
                           of consensus have been reached on global programs to promote health, sustainable development
                           and human rights, the situation on the ground in many areas has deteriorated. The
                           alarming spread of militant racialism and religious fanaticism, the cancerous growth
                           of materialism, the epidemic rise of crime and organized criminality, the widespread
                           increase in mindless violence, the ever-deepening disparity between rich and poor,
                           the continuing inequities faced by women, the intergenerational damage caused by the
                           pervasive break-down of family life, the immoral excesses of unbridled capitalism
                           and the growth of political corruption—all speak to this point. At least a billion
                           live in abject poverty and more than a third of the world’s people are illiterate.<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#436181008">3</a></sup>

                           <a id="038806719" class="brl-location"></a>As the twin processes of collapse and renewal carry the world toward some sort of
                           culmination, the 50th anniversary of the United Nations offers a timely opportunity
                           to pause and reflect on how humanity may collectively face its future. Indeed, there
                           has emerged of late a wide range of useful proposals for strengthening the United
                           Nations and improving its capacity to coordinate the responses of nations to these
                           challenges.

                           <a id="325775268" class="brl-location"></a>These proposals fall roughly into three categories. One group addresses primarily
                           bureaucratic, administrative and financial problems within the United Nations system.
                           Another group comprises those that suggest reconfiguring bodies like the Economic
                           and Social Council, the Trusteeship Council and the Bretton Woods economic institutions.
                           Still others propose to undertake changes in the United Nations political structure,
                           calling, for example, for an expansion of the Security Council and/or a reconsideration
                           of the United Nations Charter itself.<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#273589938">4</a></sup>

                           the most balanced and thoughtful is the report of the Commission on Global Governance,
                           entitled, <em>Our Global Neighborhood</em>, which argues for the widespread adoption of new values, as well as structural reforms

                           <a id="583929487" class="brl-location"></a>It is in the spirit of contributing to the ongoing discussion and consultation on
                           this issue of paramount importance that the Bahá’í International Community has been
                           moved to share its views.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <a id="244925465" class="brl-location"></a>Our perspective is based on three initial propositions. First, discussions about the
                           future of the United Nations need to take place within the broad context of the evolution
                           of the international order and its direction. The United Nations has co-evolved with
                           other great institutions of the late twentieth century. It is in the aggregate that
                           these institutions will define—and themselves be shaped by—the evolution of the international
                           order. Therefore, the mission, role, operating principles and even activities of the
                           United Nations should be examined only in the light of how they fit within the broader
                           objective of the international order.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <a id="732053540" class="brl-location"></a>Second, since the body of humankind is one and indivisible, each member of the human
                           race is born into the world as a trust of the whole. This relationship between the
                           individual and the collective constitutes the moral foundation of most of the human
                           rights which the instruments of the United Nations are attempting to define. It also
                           serves to define an overriding purpose for the international order in establishing
                           and preserving the rights of the individual.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <a id="376768015" class="brl-location"></a>Third, the discussions about the future of the international order must involve and
                           excite the generality of humankind. This discussion is so important that it cannot
                           be confined to leaders—be they in government, business, the academic community, religion,
                           or organizations of civil society. On the contrary, this conversation must engage
                           women and men at the grassroots level. Broad participation will make the process self-reinforcing
                           by raising awareness of world citizenship and increase support for an expanded international
                           order.

                           will, is the choice before all who inhabit the earth. Failure to take decisive action

                           with heads of state and with governments. We urge leaders at all levels to take a
                           deliberate role in supporting a convocation of world leaders before the turn of this
                           century to consider how the international order might be redefined and restructured
                           to meet the challenges facing the world. As some have suggested, this gathering might

                           successful United Nations conferences in the early 1990s. These conferences, which
                           have included the World Summit for Children in 1990, the Earth Summit in 1992, the
                           World Conference on Human Rights in 1993, the International Conference on Population
                           and Development in 1994, the World Summit for Social Development in 1995 and the Fourth
                           World Conference on Women in 1995, have established a new methodology for global deliberations
                           on critical issues.

                           <a id="811712257" class="brl-location"></a>A key to the success of these deliberations has been the substantive participation
                           by organizations of civil society. Painstaking negotiations among government delegations
                           about changes in the world’s political, social and economic structures have been informed
                           and shaped by the vigorous involvement of these organizations, which tend to reflect
                           the needs and concerns of people at the grass roots. It is also significant that in
                           each case, the gathering of world leaders, in the presence of civil society and the
                           global media, gave the stamp of legitimacy and consensus to the processes of the conference.

                           to reach out to as wide a circle as possible and to secure the goodwill and support

                           centralization and constitute an unwarranted layer of bureaucracy. It needs to be
                           explicitly and forcefully stated that any new structures for global governance must,
                           as a matter of both principle and practicality, ensure that the responsibility for
                           decision-making remains at appropriate levels.<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#674285989">8</a></sup>

                           and real progress can be achieved only by people themselves, acting individually and
                           collectively, in response to the specific concerns and needs of their time and place.
                           It can be argued that the decentralization of governance is the sine qua non of development.<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#004358770">9</a></sup> On the other hand, the international order clearly requires a degree of global direction
                           and coordination.

                           institutions should be given the authority to act only on issues of international
                           concern where states cannot act on their own or to intervene for the preservation
                           of the rights of peoples and member states. All other matters should be relegated
                           to national and local institutions.<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#650014168">10</a></sup>

                           <a id="973475900" class="brl-location"></a>Furthermore, in devising a specific framework for the future international order,
                           leaders should survey a broad range of approaches to governance. Rather than being
                           modeled after any single one of the recognized systems of government, the solution
                           may embody, reconcile and assimilate within its framework such wholesome elements
                           as are to be found in each one of them.
                        </p>

                           <a id="148675829" class="brl-location"></a>For example, one of the time-tested models of governance that may accommodate the
                           world’s diversity within a unified framework is the federal system. Federalism has
                           proved effective in decentralizing authority and decision-making in large, complex,
                           and heterogeneous states, while maintaining a degree of overall unity and stability.
                           Another model worth examining is the commonwealth, which at the global level would
                           place the interest of the whole ahead of the interest of any individual nation.

                           order so that it does not over time degenerate into any form of despotism, of oligarchy,

                           <a id="968759508" class="brl-location"></a>The United Nations was the centerpiece of the international system created by the
                           victors of World War II and, during the long decades of ideological conflict between
                           the East and the West, it served as a forum for international dialogue. Over the years,
                           its activities have expanded to include not only international standard-setting and
                           promotion of social and economic development but also peacekeeping operations on several
                           continents.

                           <a id="031454535" class="brl-location"></a>Over the same period, the political reality of our world has experienced a dramatic
                           transformation. At the time of the UN’s inception, there were some fifty independent
                           states. That number has grown to exceed 185. At the close of World War II, governments
                           were the main actors on the global scene. Today, the growing influence of organizations
                           of civil society and of multinational corporations has created a much more intricate
                           political landscape.

                           <a id="747839390" class="brl-location"></a>Despite the growing complexity in its mission, the United Nations system has retained
                           more or less the same structure that was designed for a new international organization
                           some fifty years ago. It is not surprising then that the occasion of its fiftieth
                           anniversary has stimulated a new dialogue about its ability to meet the political
                           realities of the 21st Century. Unfortunately, in this dialogue, criticism has far
                           outweighed praise.

                           <a id="565047551" class="brl-location"></a>Most criticisms of the operations of the United Nations are based on comparisons with
                           the operations of the leading organizations in the private sector or on measurements
                           relative to inflated initial expectations. Although some specific comparisons may
                           be useful in increasing the efficiency of the United Nations more general exercises
                           of this kind are essentially unfair. The United Nations lacks not only the clear authority,
                           but also the requisite resources to act effectively in most instances. Accusations
                           of the UN’s failure are in fact indictments of the member states themselves.

                           <a id="013927410" class="brl-location"></a>Judged in isolation from the reality within which it operates, the United Nations
                           will always seem inefficient and ineffective. However, if it is viewed as one element
                           of a larger process of development in systems of international order, the bright light
                           of analysis would shift from the UN’s shortcomings and failures to shine on its victories
                           and accomplishments. To those with an evolutionary mindset, the early experience of
                           the United Nations offers us a rich source of learning about its future role within
                           the international regime.

                           <a id="408999829" class="brl-location"></a>An evolutionary mindset implies the ability to envision an institution over a long
                           time frame perceiving its inherent potential for development, identifying the fundamental
                           principles governing its growth, formulating high-impact strategies for short-term
                           implementation, and even anticipating radical discontinuities along its path.

                           <a id="804489041" class="brl-location"></a> Studying the United Nations from this perspective unveils significant opportunities
                           to strengthen the current system without the wholesale restructuring of its principal
                           institutions or the intensive re-engineering of its core processes. In fact, we submit
                           that no proposal for UN reform can produce high impact unless its recommendations
                           are internally consistent and direct the UN along a projected evolutionary path toward
                           a distinctive and relevant role within the future international order.

                              for promulgating law is the legislature. While the authority of local and national
                              legislatures is generally respected, regional and international legislative bodies
                              have been the subject of fear and suspicion.
                           </p>

                              <a id="645995001" class="brl-location"></a>In addition, the United Nations General Assembly has been a target of attack for its
                              ineffectiveness. Although some of the accusations hurled against it are unfounded,
                              there are at least two shortcomings that hamper the ability of the General Assembly
                              to have impact.
                           </p>

                              <a id="540487092" class="brl-location"></a>First, the current arrangement gives undue weight to state sovereignty, resulting
                              in a curious mix of anarchy and conservatism. In a reformed United Nations, the legislative
                              branch and its voting structure will need to represent more accurately the people
                              of the world as well as nation-states.<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#914455404">13</a></sup>

                              <a id="471820160" class="brl-location"></a>Second, General Assembly resolutions are not binding unless they are separately ratified
                              as a treaty by each member state. If the current system, which places state sovereignty
                              above all other concerns, is to give way to a system which can address the interests
                              of a single and interdependent humanity, the resolutions of the General Assembly—within
                              a limited domain of issues—must gradually come to possess the force of law with provisions
                              for both enforcement and sanctions.
                           </p>

                              <a id="629959899" class="brl-location"></a>These two shortcomings are closely linked inasmuch as the majority of the world’s
                              people, suspicious and fearful of world government, are unlikely to submit to an international
                              institution unless it is itself more genuinely representative.<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#588860510">14</a></sup>

                              oneness into a collective will through which the necessary structures of global community
                              life can be confidently erected. An age that sees the people of the world increasingly
                              gaining access to information of every kind and to a diversity of ideas will find
                              justice asserting itself as the ruling principle of successful social organization.

                              <a id="697876730" class="brl-location"></a>At the individual level, justice is that faculty of the human soul that enables each
                              person to distinguish truth from falsehood. In the sight of God, Bahá’u’lláh avers,
                              justice is “the best beloved of all things” since it permits each individual to see
                              with his own eyes rather than the eyes of others, to know through his own knowledge
                              rather than the knowledge of his neighbor or his group.
                           </p>

                              <a id="075318814" class="brl-location"></a>At the group level, a concern for justice is the indispensable compass in collective
                              decision-making, because it is the only means by which unity of thought and action
                              can be achieved. Far from encouraging the punitive spirit that has often masqueraded
                              under its name in past ages, justice is the practical expression of awareness that,
                              in the achievement of human progress, the interests of the individual and those of
                              society are inextricably linked. To the extent that justice becomes a guiding concern
                              of human interaction, a consultative climate is encouraged that permits options to
                              be examined dispassionately and appropriate courses of action selected. In such a
                              climate the perennial tendencies toward manipulation and partisanship are far less
                              likely to deflect the decision-making process.

                              <a id="683596793" class="brl-location"></a>Such a conception of justice will be gradually reinforced by the realization that
                              in an interdependent world, the interests of the individual and society are inextricably
                              intertwined. In this context, justice is a thread that must be woven into the consideration
                              of every interaction, whether in the family, the neighborhood, or at the global level.

                              the International Court of Justice is characterized by many positive elements. The

                           people. Separated by several layers of government from the international arena and
                           confused by the media’s coverage of international news, the vast majority of people
                           have not yet developed an affinity for institutions like the United Nations. Only

                           like organizations of civil society seem able to identify with these institutions.

                           the people of the world. Such recognition would set in motion a virtuous cycle of

                           individual. International institutions will succeed in eliciting and directing the
                           potentialities latent in the peoples of the world to the extent that their exercise
                           of authority is moderated by their obligation to win the confidence, respect, and
                           genuine support of those whose actions they seek to govern and to consult openly and

                              the exclusion of women from the decision-making processes at all levels, a general
                              inability to ensure that resources reach the poor, and the diversion of development

                              flaw in the current paradigm for economic development: material needs are often addressed

                              society. True prosperity encompasses spiritual as well as material well-being. Food,
                              drink, shelter and a degree of material comfort are essential, but human beings cannot
                              and never will find fulfillment in these necessities. Nor is contentment to be found
                              in the somewhat more intangible material attainments such as social recognition or
                              political power. Ultimately, not even intellectual achievement satisfies our deepest

                              of the human spirit can be properly understood. Although the spiritual side of our
                              nature is obscured by the day-to-day struggle for material attainment, our need for
                              the transcendent cannot long be disregarded. Thus a sustainable development paradigm
                              must address both the spiritual aspirations of human beings and their material needs
                              and desires.

                              possess,” writes Bahá’u’lláh. “Regard man as a mine rich in gems of inestimable value.

                              learning a set of life skills. In truth, education, which should be a fundamental
                              imperative of development, must also teach the process for knowledge acquisition,

                              Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted by the United Nations in 1948 and elaborated
                              in two international covenants—the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights
                              and the International Covenant on Social, Economic and Cultural Rights. In addition,
                              some 75 other conventions and declarations identify and promote the rights of women
                              and children, the right to freedom of worship, and the right to development, to name

                              <a id="060996045" class="brl-location"></a>The current United Nations human rights regime has two major shortcomings: limited
                              means for enforcement and follow-up, and too little emphasis on the responsibilities
                              that accompany all rights.

                              <a id="584394256" class="brl-location"></a>Human rights enforcement at the international level needs to be handled in a manner
                              similar to the treatment of military aggression under a collective security regime.
                              The violation of human rights in one state must be considered the concern of all,
                              and enforcement mechanisms must provide for a unified response on the part of the
                              entire international community. The question of when and how to intervene to protect
                              human rights is more difficult to answer. Vigorous enforcement will require a high
                              degree of global consensus on what constitutes a flagrant and willful violation.

                              the 1993 World Conference on Human Rights, which affirmed unequivocally that human
                              rights are universal, indivisible and interdependent, and ended the long-standing
                              debate about the relative importance of civil and political rights as compared to
                              social, economic and cultural rights.<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#932626925">32</a></sup> Conference resolutions also confirmed that human rights must be applied irrespective
                              of differences of racial background, ethnic origin, religious belief or national identity.
                              They encompass the equality of women and men; they include for all individuals worldwide
                              the same rights to freedom of investigation, information and religious practice; and
                              they embody the right of everyone to basic necessities such as food, shelter, and
                              health care.<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#232508019">33</a></sup> Beyond the need to build consensus and strengthen enforcement of human rights, it
                              is important to establish a greater understanding that to each right is attached a
                              corresponding responsibility.

                              to obey the law—and to make both the laws and the legal system more just. Likewise,
                              in the socio-economic realm, the right to marry carries with it the responsibility
                              to support the family unit, to educate one’s children and to treat all family members
                              with respect.<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#034664392">34</a></sup> The right to work cannot be divorced from the responsibility to perform one’s duties
                              to the best of one’s ability. In the broadest sense, the notion of “universal” human
                              rights implies a responsibility to humanity as a whole.

                              have not yet ratified the international conventions. While these member states would
                              still be able to fully participate in deliberations, it would protect the United Nations

                              human rights within their constitutions, but which have not been able to complete
                              the ratification process because of internal political reasons, should not be barred
                              from election to visible positions.

                              <a id="554823388" class="brl-location"></a>It is time for the institutions of the world, composed mainly of men, to use their
                              influence to promote the systematic inclusion of women, not out of condescension or
                              presumed self-sacrifice but as an act motivated by the belief that the contributions
                              of women are required for society to progress.<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#820254996">36</a></sup> Only as the contributions of women are valued will they be sought out and woven into
                              the fabric of society. The result will be a more peaceful, balanced, just and prosperous
                              civilization.<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#932544094">37</a></sup>

                              <a id="388288893" class="brl-location"></a>The obvious biological differences between the sexes need not be a cause for inequality
                              or disunity. Rather, they are an aspect of complementarity. If the role of women as
                              mothers is properly valued, their work in nurturing and educating children will be
                              respected and properly rewarded. It should also be acknowledged that the child-bearing
                              role does not diminish one’s aptitude for leadership, or undermine one’s intellectual,
                              scientific or creative capacity. Indeed, it may be an enhancement.

                              <a id="042314735" class="brl-location"></a>We believe progress on a few critical fronts would have the greatest impact on the
                              advancement of women. We share the following perspectives which are foundational to
                              the recommendations which follow.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <a id="815972386" class="brl-location"></a>First and foremost, violence against women and girls, one of the most blatant and
                              widespread abuses of human rights, must be eradicated. Violence has been a fact of
                              life for many women throughout the world, regardless of race, class, or educational
                              background. In many societies, traditional beliefs that women are inferior or a burden
                              make them easy targets of anger and frustration. Even strong legal remedies and enforcement
                              mechanisms will have little effect until they are supported by a transformation in
                              the attitudes of men. Women will not be safe until a new social conscience takes hold,
                              one which will make the mere expression of condescending attitudes towards women,
                              let alone any form of physical violence, a cause for deep shame.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <a id="088656252" class="brl-location"></a>Second, the family remains the basic building block of society and behaviors observed
                              and learned there will be projected onto interactions at all other levels of society.
                              Therefore, the members of the institution of the family must be transformed so that
                              the principle of equality of women and men is internalized. Further, if the bonds
                              of love and unity cement family relationships, the impact will reach beyond its borders
                              and affect society as a whole.

                              <a id="216138214" class="brl-location"></a>Third, while the overall goal of any society must be to educate all its members, at
                              this stage in human history the greatest need is to educate women and girls.<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#523861122">38</a></sup> For over twenty years, studies have consistently documented that, of all possible
                              investments, educating women and girls pays the highest overall dividends in terms
                              of social development, the eradication of poverty and the advancement of community.<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#857560511">39</a></sup>

                              <a id="653285260" class="brl-location"></a>Fourth, the global dialogue on the role of men and women must promote recognition
                              of the intrinsic complementarity of the two sexes. For the differences between them
                              are a natural assertion of the necessity of women and men to work together to bring
                              to fruition their potentialities for advancing civilization, no less than for perpetuating
                              the human race. Such differences are inherent in the interactive character of their
                              common humanity. This dialogue needs to consider the historical forces which have
                              led to the oppression of women and examine the new social, political and spiritual
                              realities which are today transforming our civilization.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <a id="447710975" class="brl-location"></a>As a starting point for this dialogue we offer this analogy from the Bahá’í Writings:
                              “The world of humanity has two wings—one is women and the other men. Not until both
                              wings are equally developed can the bird fly. Should one wing remain weak, flight
                              is impossible.”<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#293031177">40</a></sup> In addition, we support the following three specific measures.

                              and progress; altruism should guide all human endeavor, such that sincerity and respect

                           successively attempted and fully established. World unity is the goal towards which
                           a harassed humanity is striving. Nation-building has come to an end. The anarchy inherent
                           in state sovereignty is moving towards a climax. A world, growing to maturity, must
                           abandon this fetish, recognize the oneness and wholeness of human relationships, and
                           establish once for all the machinery that can best incarnate this fundamental principle

                           <a id="951235161" class="brl-location"></a>Over a century ago, Bahá’u’lláh taught that there is but one God, that there is only
                           one human race, and that all the world’s religions represent stages in the revelation
                           of God’s will and purpose for humanity. Bahá’u’lláh announced the arrival of the time,
                           foretold in all of the world’s scriptures, when humanity would at last witness the
                           uniting of all peoples into a peaceful and integrated society.

                           <a id="536410024" class="brl-location"></a>He said that human destiny lies not merely in the creation of a materially prosperous
                           society, but also in the construction of a global civilization where individuals are
                           encouraged to act as moral beings who understand their true nature and are able to
                           progress toward a greater fulfillment that no degree of material bounty alone can
                           provide.

                           <a id="469209669" class="brl-location"></a>Bahá’u’lláh was also among the first to invoke the phrase “new world order” to describe
                           the momentous changes in the political, social and religious life of the world. “The
                           signs of impending convulsions and chaos can now be discerned, inasmuch as the prevailing
                           Order appeareth to be lamentably defective,” He wrote. “Soon will the present-day
                           order be rolled up and a new one spread out in its stead.”<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#282443949">46</a></sup>

                           <a id="365224115" class="brl-location"></a>To this end, He laid a charge on the leaders and members of society alike. “It is
                           not for him to pride himself who loveth his own country, but rather for him who loveth
                           the whole world. The earth is but one country and mankind its citizens.”<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#644282080">47</a></sup>

                           <a id="524812659" class="brl-location"></a>Above all else, leaders for the next generation must be motivated by a sincere desire
                           to serve the entire community and must understand that leadership is a responsibility;
                           not a path to privilege. For too long, leadership has been understood, by both leaders
                           and followers, as the assertion of control over others. Indeed, this age demands a
                           new definition of leadership and a new type of leader.<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#780472321">48</a></sup>

                           people for institutions of the international order, these leaders will have to reflect
                           on their own actions.

                           to and guided by principles, thereby acting in the best long-term interests of humanity

                                       for the development of human society, including paleontologist Richard Leakey: “We
                                       are one species, one people. Every individual on this earth is a member of ‘homo sapiens
                                       sapiens’, and the geographical variations we see among peoples are simply biological
                                       nuances on the basic theme. The human capacity for culture permits its elaboration
                                       in widely different and colorful ways. The often very deep differences between those
                                       cultures should not be seen as divisions between people. Instead, cultures should
                                       be interpreted for what they really are: the ultimate declaration of belonging to
                                       the human species.”

                                       coined in the early ‘70s as an economic principle, applies equally to governance.
                                       Schumacher explains: “In the affairs of men, there always appears to be a need for
                                       at least two things simultaneously, which, on the face of it, seem to be incompatible
                                       and to exclude one another. We always need both freedom and order. We need the freedom
                                       of lots and lots of small, autonomous unities, and, at the same time, the orderliness
                                       of large-scale, possibly global, unity and coordination.”

                                       are to be avoided. It does not ignore, nor does it attempt to suppress, the diversity
                                       of ethnical origins, of climate, of history, of language and tradition, of thought
                                       and habit, that differentiate the peoples and nations of the world. It calls for a
                                       wider loyalty, for a larger aspiration than any that has animated the human race.
                                       It insists upon the subordination of national impulses and interests to the imperative
                                       claims of a unified world. It repudiates excessive centralization on one hand, and
                                       disclaims all attempts at uniformity on the other.”

                                       sketched out some of the functions and responsibilities for a future world legislature.
                                       Among other things, he wrote: “a world legislature, whose members will, as trustees

                                       political, social and religious life of the world. In the late 1860s, He wrote: “The

                                       might go about determining fair and just borders for all nations. But as daunting
                                       as the task may seem, it is an important part of the process of building a new order.
                                       Wrote ‘Abdu’l‑Bahá: “True civilization will unfurl its banner in the midmost heart
                                       of the world whenever a certain number of its distinguished and high-minded sovereigns—the
                                       shining exemplars of devotion and determination—shall, for the good and happiness
                                       of all mankind, arise, with firm resolve and clear vision, to establish the Cause
                                       of Universal Peace. They must make the Cause of Peace the object of general consultation,
                                       and seek by every means in their power to establish a Union of the nations of the
                                       world. They must conclude a binding treaty and establish a covenant, the provisions
                                       of which shall be sound, inviolable and definite. They must proclaim it to all the
                                       world and obtain for it the sanction of all the human race. This supreme and noble
                                       undertaking—the real source of the peace and well-being of all the world—should be
                                       regarded as sacred by all that dwell on earth. All the forces of humanity must be
                                       mobilized to ensure the stability and permanence of this Most Great Covenant. In this
                                       all-embracing Pact the limits and frontiers of each and every nation should be clearly
                                       fixed, the principles underlying the relations of governments towards one another
                                       definitely laid down, and all international agreements and obligations ascertained.
                                       In like manner, the size of the armaments of every government should be strictly limited,
                                       for if the preparations for war and the military forces of any nation should be allowed
                                       to increase, they will arouse the suspicion of others. The fundamental principle underlying
                                       this solemn Pact should be so fixed that if any government later violate any one of
                                       its provisions, all the governments on earth should arise to reduce it to utter submission,
                                       nay the human race as a whole should resolve, with every power at its disposal, to
                                       destroy that government. Should this greatest of all remedies be applied to the sick
                                       body of the world, it will assuredly recover from its ills and will remain eternally
                                       safe and secure.”

                                       teachings value and promote cultural diversity, not uniformity. At this point in history,
                                       then, we do not envision imposing a single language worldwide. Rather, what we imagine
                                       is that peoples and nations would keep their own local and national languages—while
                                       at the same time be encouraged to learn a universal language. Certainly such a universal
                                       language should ultimately be taught, as a required subject, in all of the world’s
                                       schools. But this should in no way detract from legitimate expressions of national
                                       and local linguistic and cultural diversity.

                                       of the 1981 Nobel Prize for Economics, observes that “a permanent single currency”
                                       would eliminate much if not all of the turbulence currently associated with the huge
                                       amount of currency speculation on world markets today. Observing that such a single
                                       world currency is probably a long way off, he proposes as an interim measure an “international
                                       uniform tax” on spot transactions in foreign exchange.

                                          court: “the national assemblies of each country and nation—that is to say parliaments—should
                                          elect two or three persons who are the choicest of that nation, and are well informed
                                          concerning international laws and the relations between governments and aware of the
                                          essential needs of the world of humanity in this day. The number of these representatives
                                          should be in proportion to the number of inhabitants of that country. The election
                                          of these souls who are chosen by the national assembly, that is, the parliament, must
                                          be confirmed by the upper house, the congress and the cabinet and also by the president
                                          or monarch so these persons may be the elected ones of all the nation and the government.
                                          The Supreme Tribunal will be composed of these people, and all mankind will thus have
                                          a share therein, for every one of these delegates is fully representative of his nation.
                                          When the Supreme Tribunal gives a ruling on any international question, either unanimously
                                          or by majority rule, there will no longer be any pretext for the plaintiff or ground
                                          of objection for the defendant. In case any of the governments or nations, in the
                                          execution of the irrefutable decision of the Supreme Tribunal, be negligent or dilatory,
                                          the rest of the nations will rise up against it, because all the governments and nations
                                          of the world are the supporters of this Supreme Tribunal. Consider what a firm foundation
                                          this is! But by a limited and restricted League the purpose will not be realized as
                                          it ought and should.”

                                       others left wild. The proof is clear that the world of nature is imperfect, the world
                                       of education perfect. That is to say, man is rescued from the exigencies of nature
                                       by training and culture; consequently, education is necessary, obligatory. But education
                                       is of various kinds. There is a training and development of the physical body which
                                       ensures strength and growth. There is intellectual education or mental training for
                                       which schools and colleges are founded. The third kind of education is that of the
                                       spirit. Through the breaths of the Holy Spirit man is uplifted into the world of moralities
                                       and illumined by the lights of divine bestowals. The moral world is only attained
                                       through the effulgence of the Sun of Reality and the quickening life of the divine

                                       achievable nor desirable. Absolute equality is a chimera. At various points along
                                       the way, there will nevertheless be the necessity for the redistribution of some of
                                       the world’s wealth. For, indeed, it is becoming increasingly obvious that unbridled
                                       capitalism does not provide the answer either. Some regulation and redistribution
                                       is necessary to promote material justice. In this regard, a tax on income is, in principle,
                                       one of the fairest and most equitable means. There must also be a role for the voluntary
                                       sharing of wealth—both at an individual and an institutional level. Equal opportunities
                                       for economic advancement and progress, however, must be woven into the very fabric
                                       of the new order. Ultimately, the most important regulation on any economic system
                                       is the moral regulation that begins in the hearts and minds of people. <span class="brl-returntotext"> <a href="#933988572">↩</a>

                                       or herself. The freedom to investigate the purpose of existence and to develop the
                                       endowments of human nature that make it achievable requires protection. Human beings
                                       must be free to know. That such freedom is often abused and such abuse grossly encouraged
                                       by features of contemporary society does not detract in any degree from the validity
                                       of the impulse itself.

                                       imperative for the enunciation of many of the rights enshrined in the Universal Declaration
                                       and the related Covenants. Universal education, freedom of movement, access to information,
                                       and the opportunity to participate in political life are all aspects of its operation
                                       that require explicit guarantee by the international community. The same is true of
                                       freedom of thought and belief, including religious liberty, along with the right to

                                       into the world as a trust of the whole. This trusteeship constitutes the moral foundation
                                       of most of the other rights—principally economic and social—which the instruments
                                       of the United Nations are attempting similarly to define. The security of the family
                                       and the home, the ownership of property, and the right to privacy are all implied
                                       in such a trusteeship. The obligations on the part of the community extend to the
                                       provision of employment, mental and physical health care, social security, fair wages,
                                       rest and recreation, and a host of other reasonable expectations on the part of the

                                       of national and international law. Much like the role played by the gene pool in the

                                       expressions need to be protected from suffocation by the materialistic influences
                                       currently holding sway. On the other, cultures must be enabled to interact with one

                                       of the world to the members of a family. A family is a nation in miniature. Simply
                                       enlarge the circle of the household, and you have the nation. Enlarge the circle of
                                       nations, and you have all humanity. The conditions surrounding the family surround
                                       the nation. The happenings in the family are the happenings in the life of the nation.
                                       Would it add to the progress and advancement of a family if dissensions should arise
                                       among its members, all fighting, pillaging each other, jealous and revengeful of injury,
                                       seeking selfish advantage? Nay, this would be the cause of the effacement of progress
                                       and advancement. So it is in the great family of nations, for nations are but an aggregate
                                       of families. Therefore, as strife and dissension destroy a family and prevent its
                                       progress, so nations are destroyed and advancement hindered.”

                                       of warfare for the reason that women will never be willing to sanction it. Mothers

                                       access to education, has been a long-standing principle in the Bahá’í teachings. Speaking
                                       in 1912, ‘Abdu’l‑Bahá said: “In proclaiming the oneness of mankind [Bahá’u’lláh] taught
                                       that men and women are equal in the sight of God and that there is no distinction
                                       to be made between them. The only difference between them now is due to lack of education
                                       and training. If woman is given equal opportunity of education, distinction and estimate
                                       of inferiority will disappear.… Furthermore, the education of women is of greater
                                       importance than the education of men, for they are the mothers of the race, and mothers
                                       rear the children. The first teachers of children are the mothers. Therefore, they
                                       must be capably trained in order to educate both sons and daughters. There are many
                                       provisions in the words of Bahá’u’lláh in regard to this.

                                          at the lack of leadership over a wide spectrum of human affairs. At national, regional,
