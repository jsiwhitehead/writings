                        <a id="713721789" class="brl-location"></a>There was, in the city of Najaf, among the disciples of the widely known mujtahid,
                        <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Murtaḍá, a man without likeness or peer. His name was Áqá Muḥammad-i-Qá’iní, and
                        later on he would receive, from the Manifestation, the title of Nabíl-i-Akbar.<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#371097223">1</a></sup> This eminent soul became the leading member of the mujtahid’s company of disciples.
                        Singled out from among them all, he alone was given the rank of mujtahid—for the late
                        <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Murtaḍá was never wont to confer this degree.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="765534198" class="brl-location"></a>He excelled not only in theology but in other branches of knowledge, such as the humanities,
                        the philosophy of the Illuminati, the teachings of the mystics and of the <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u>í School. He was a universal man, in himself alone a convincing proof. When his eyes
                        were opened to the light of Divine guidance, and he breathed in the fragrances of
                        Heaven, he became a flame of God. Then his heart leapt within him, and in an ecstasy
                        of joy and love, he roared out like a leviathan in the deep.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="178242330" class="brl-location"></a>With praises showered upon him, he received his new rank from the mujtahid. He then
                        left Najaf and came to Baghdad, and here he was honored with meeting Bahá’u’lláh.
                        Here he beheld the light that blazed on Sinai in the Holy Tree. Soon he was in such
                        a state that he could rest neither day nor night.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="359487187" class="brl-location"></a>One day, on the floor of the outer apartments reserved for the men, the honored Nabíl
                        was reverently kneeling in the presence of Bahá’u’lláh. At that moment Ḥájí Mírzá
                        Ḥasan-‘Amú, a trusted associate of the mujtahids of Karbilá, came in with Zaynu’l-‘Ábidín
                        <u>Kh</u>án, the Fa<u>kh</u>ru’d-Dawlih. Observing how humbly and deferentially Nabíl was kneeling there, the
                        Ḥají was astonished.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="020254582" class="brl-location"></a>“Sir,” he murmured, “what are you doing in this place?”
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="250428662" class="brl-location"></a>Nabíl answered, “I came here for the same reason you did.”
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="403422057" class="brl-location"></a>The two visitors could not recover from their surprise, for it was widely known that
                        this personage was unique among mujtahids and was the most favored disciple of the
                        renowned <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Murtaḍá.
                     </p>

                        <a id="520950266" class="brl-location"></a>Later, Nabíl-i-Akbar left for Persia and went on to <u>Kh</u>urásán. The Amír of Qá’in—Mír ‘Alam <u>Kh</u>án—showed him every courtesy at first, and greatly valued his company. So marked was
                        this that people felt the Amír was captivated by him, and indeed he was spellbound
                        at the scholar’s eloquence, knowledge, and accomplishments. One can judge, from this,
                        what honors were accorded to Nabíl by the rest, for “men follow the faith of their
                        kings.”
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="701624862" class="brl-location"></a>Nabíl spent some time thus esteemed and in high favor, but the love he had for God
                        was past all concealing. It burst from his heart, flamed out and consumed its coverings.

                        <a id="238944908" class="brl-location"></a>He brought light to the Qá’in area and converted a great number of people. And when
                        he had become known far and wide by this new name, the clergy, envious and malevolent,
                        arose, and informed against him, sending their calumnies on to Ṭihrán, so that Náṣiri’d-Dín
                        <u>Sh</u>áh rose up in wrath. Terrified of the <u>Sh</u>áh, the Amír attacked Nabíl with all his might. Soon the whole city was in an uproar,
                        and the populace, lashed to fury, turned upon him.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="522117471" class="brl-location"></a>That enraptured lover of God never gave way, but withstood them all. At last, however,
                        they drove him out—drove out that man who saw what they did not—and he went up to
                        Ṭihrán, where he was a fugitive, and homeless.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="579548879" class="brl-location"></a>Here, his enemies struck at him again. He was pursued by the watchmen; guards looked
                        everywhere for him, asking after him in every street and alley, hunting him down to
                        catch and torture him. Hiding, he would pass by them like the sigh of the oppressed,
                        and rise to the hills; or again, like the tears of the wronged, he would slip down
                        into the valleys. He could no longer wear the turban denoting his rank; he disguised
                        himself, putting on a layman’s hat, so that they would fail to recognize him and would
                        let him be.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="598376099" class="brl-location"></a>In secret, with all his powers he kept on spreading the Faith and setting forth its
                        proofs, and was a guiding lamp to many souls. He was exposed to danger at all times,
                        always vigilant and on his guard. The Government never gave up its search for him,
                        nor did the people cease from discussing his case.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="368663200" class="brl-location"></a>He left, then, for Bu<u>kh</u>árá and ‘I<u>sh</u>qábád, continuously teaching the Faith in those regions. Like a candle, he was using
                        up his life; but in spite of his sufferings he was never dispirited, rather his joy
                        and ardor increased with every passing day. He was eloquent of speech; he was a skilled
                        physician, a remedy for every ill, a balm to every sore. He would guide the Illuminati
                        by their own philosophical principles, and with the mystics he would prove the Divine
                        Advent in terms of “inspiration” and the “celestial vision.” He would convince the
                        <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u>í leaders by quoting the very words of their late Founders, <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Aḥmad and Siyyid Káẓim, and would convert Islamic theologians with texts from the
                        Qur’án and traditions from the Imáms, who guide mankind aright. Thus he was an instant
                        medicine to the ailing, and a rich bestowal to the poor.

                        <a id="063134360" class="brl-location"></a>He became penniless in Bu<u>kh</u>árá and a prey to many troubles, until at the last, far from his homeland, he died,
                        hastening away to the Kingdom where no poverty exists.

                        to light, and will serve as an admonition to the learned. It is true that in this
                        swiftly passing world he was the target of countless woes; and yet, all those generations
                        of powerful clerics, those <u>sh</u>ay<u>kh</u>s like Murtaḍá and Mírzá Ḥabíbu’lláh and Áyatu’lláh-i-<u>Kh</u>urásání and Mullá Asadu’lláh-i-Mázindarání—all of them will disappear without a trace.
                        They will leave no name behind them, no sign, no fruit. No word will be passed down
                        from any of them; no man will tell of them again. But because he stood steadfast in
                        this holy Faith, because he guided souls and served this Cause and spread its fame,
                        that star, Nabíl, will shine forever from the horizon of abiding light.

                        at the end; and ease and comfort not met with on the path of God are finally but care
                        and sorrow; and all such wealth is penury, and nothing more.

                        down his life, and in dying, triumphed. He passed by the world and its rewards; he
                        closed his eyes to rank and wealth; he loosed himself from all such chains and fetters,
                        and put every worldly thought aside. Of wide learning, at once a mujtahid, a philosopher,
                        a mystic, and gifted with intuitive sight, he was also an accomplished man of letters
                        and an orator without a peer. He had a great and universal mind.

                        his last breath. When young, he joined the circle of the late Siyyid Káẓim and became
                        one of his disciples. He was known in Persia for his purity of life, winning fame
                        as Mullá Ṣádiq the saintly. He was a blessed individual, a man accomplished, learned,
                        and much honored. The people of <u>Kh</u>urásán were strongly attached to him, for he was a great scholar and among the most
                        renowned of matchless and unique divines. As a teacher of the Faith, he spoke with
                        such eloquence, such extraordinary power, that his hearers were won over with great
                        ease.

                        <a id="614986898" class="brl-location"></a>After he had come to Baghdad and attained the presence of Bahá’u’lláh, he was seated
                        one day in the courtyard of the men’s apartments, by the little garden. I was in one
                        of the rooms just above, that gave onto the courtyard. At that moment a Persian prince,
                        a grandson of Fath-‘Alí <u>Sh</u>áh, arrived at the house. The prince said to him, “Who are you?” Ismu’lláh answered,
                        “I am a servant of this Threshhold. I am one of the keepers of this door.” And as
                        I listened from above, he began to teach the Faith. The prince at first objected violently;
                        and yet, in a quarter of an hour, gently and benignly, Jináb-i-Ismu’lláh had quieted
                        him down. After the prince had so sharply denied what was said, and his face had so
                        clearly reflected his fury, now his wrath was changed to smiles and he expressed the
                        greatest satisfaction at having encountered Ismu’lláh and heard what he had to say.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="421484628" class="brl-location"></a>He always taught cheerfully and with gaiety, and would respond gently and with good
                        humor, no matter how much passionate anger might be turned against him by the one
                        with whom he spoke. His way of teaching was excellent. He was truly Ismu’lláh, the
                        Name of God, not for his fame but because he was a chosen soul.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="031091579" class="brl-location"></a>Ismu’lláh had memorized a great number of Islámic traditions and had mastered the
                        teachings of <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Aḥmad and Siyyid Káẓim. He became a believer in <u>Sh</u>íráz, in the early days of the Faith, and was soon widely known as such. And because
                        he began to teach openly and boldly, they hung a halter on him and led him about the
                        streets and bázárs of the city. Even in that condition, composed and smiling, he kept
                        on speaking to the people. He did not yield; he was not silenced. When they freed
                        him he left <u>Sh</u>íráz and went to <u>Kh</u>urásán, and there, too, began to spread the Faith, following which he traveled on,
                        in the company of Bábu’l-Báb, to Fort Ṭabarsí. Here he endured intense sufferings
                        as a member of that band of sacrificial victims. They took him prisoner at the Fort
                        and delivered him over to the chiefs of Mázindarán, to lead him about and finally
                        kill him in a certain district of that province. When, bound with chains, Ismu’lláh
                        was brought to the appointed place, God put it into one man’s heart to free him from
                        prison in the middle of the night and guide him to a place where he was safe. Throughout
                        all these agonizing trials he remained staunch in his faith.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="348098390" class="brl-location"></a>Think, for example, how the enemy had completely hemmed in the Fort, and were endlessly
                        pouring in cannon balls from their siege guns. The believers, among them Ismu’lláh,
                        went eighteen days without food. They lived on the leather of their shoes. This too
                        was soon consumed, and they had nothing left but water. They drank a mouthful every
                        morning, and lay famished and exhausted in their Fort. When attacked, however, they
                        would instantly spring to their feet, and manifest in the face of the enemy a magnificent
                        courage and astonishing resistance, and drive the army back from their walls. The
                        hunger lasted eighteen days. It was a terrible ordeal. To begin with, they were far
                        from home, surrounded and cut off by the foe; again, they were starving; and then
                        there were the army’s sudden onslaughts and the bombshells raining down and bursting
                        in the heart of the Fort. Under such circumstances to maintain an unwavering faith
                        and patience is extremely difficult, and to endure such dire afflictions a rare phenomenon.<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#806509856">1</a></sup>

                        he attained the presence of Bahá’u’lláh, and again in the Most Great Prison, receiving

                        like a spring cloud. His face was luminous, his life spiritual, his knowledge both

                        of God, the All-Glorious. Early in life, this illustrious man attended institutions
                        of higher learning and labored diligently, by day and night, until he became thoroughly
                        conversant with the learning of the day, with secular studies, philosophy, and religious
                        jurisprudence. He frequented the gatherings of philosophers, mystics, and <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u>ís, thoughtfully traversing those areas of knowledge, intuitive wisdom, and illumination;
                        but he thirsted after the wellspring of truth, and hungered for the bread that comes
                        down from Heaven. No matter how he strove to perfect himself in those regions of the
                        mind, he was never satisfied; he never reached the goal of his desires; his lips stayed
                        parched; he was confused, perplexed, and felt that he had wandered from his path.
                        The reason was that in all those circles he had found no passion; no joy, no ecstasy;
                        no faintest scent of love. And as he went deeper into the core of those manifold beliefs,
                        he discovered that from the day of the Prophet Muḥammad’s advent until our own times,
                        innumerable sects have arisen: creeds differing among themselves; disparate opinions,
                        divergent goals, uncounted roads and ways. And he found each one, under some plea
                        or other, claiming to reveal spiritual truth; each one believing that it alone followed
                        the true path—this although the Muḥammedic sea could rise in one great tide, and carry
                        all those sects away to the ocean floor. “No cry shalt thou hear from them, nor a
                        whisper even.”<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#829869804">1</a></sup>

                        Whoso ponders the lessons of history will learn that this sea has lifted up innumerable
                        waves, yet in the end each has dissolved and vanished, like a shadow drifting by.
                        The waves have perished, but the sea lives on. This is why ‘Alí Qabl-i-Akbar could
                        never quench his thirst, till the day when he stood on the shore of Truth and cried:

                        Like a fountain, his heart welled and jetted forth; meaning and truth, like soft-flowing
                        crystal waters, began to stream from his lips. At first, with humility, with spiritual
                        poverty, he garnered the new light, and only then he proceeded to shed it abroad.
                        For how well has it been said,

                        pointed their fingers at him, calling him a Bahá’í. Whenever trouble broke out, he
                        was the one to be arrested first. He was always ready and waiting for this, since
                        it never failed.
                     </p>

                        <a id="624465222" class="brl-location"></a>Again and again he was bound with chains, jailed, and threatened with the sword. The
                        photograph of this blessed individual, together with that of the great Amín, taken
                        of them in their chains, will serve as an example to whoever has eyes to see. There
                        they sit, those two distinguished men, hung with chains, shackled, yet composed, acquiescent,
                        undisturbed.

                        <a id="613799583" class="brl-location"></a>Things came to such a pass that in the end whenever there was an uproar Mullá ‘Alí
                        would put on his turban, wrap himself in his ‘abá and sit waiting, for his enemies
                        to rouse and the farrá<u>sh</u>es to break in and the guards to carry him off to prison. But observe the power of
                        God! In spite of all this, he was kept safe. “The sign of a knower and lover is this,
                        that you will find him dry in the sea.” That is how he was. His life hung by a thread
                        from one moment to the next; the malevolent lay in wait for him; he was known everywhere
                        as a Bahá’í—and still he was protected from all harm. He stayed dry in the depths
                        of the sea, cool and safe in the heart of the fire, until the day he died.
                     </p>

                        <a id="433547155" class="brl-location"></a>After the ascension of Bahá’u’lláh, Mullá ‘Alí continued on, loyal to the Testament
                        of the Light of the World, staunch in the Covenant which he served and heralded. During
                        the lifetime of the Manifestation, his yearning made him hasten to Bahá’u’lláh, Who
                        received him with grace and favor, and showered blessings upon him. He returned, then,
                        to Írán, where he devoted all his time to serving the Cause. Openly at odds with his
                        tyrannical oppressors, no matter how often they threatened him, he defied them. He
                        was never vanquished. Whatever he had to say, he said. He was one of the Hands of
                        the Cause of God, steadfast, unshakable, not to be moved.
                     </p>

                        <a id="429826656" class="brl-location"></a>I loved him very much, for he was delightful to converse with, and as a companion
                        second to none. One night, not long ago, I saw him in the world of dreams. Although
                        his frame had always been massive, in the dream world he appeared larger and more
                        corpulent than ever. It seemed as if he had returned from a journey. I said to him,
                        “Jináb, you have grown good and stout.” “Yes,” he answered, “praise be to God! I have
                        been in places where the air was fresh and sweet, and the water crystal pure; the
                        landscapes were beautiful to look upon, the foods delectable. It all agreed with me,
                        of course, so I am stronger than ever now, and I have recovered the zest of my early
                        youth. The breaths of the All-Merciful blew over me and all my time was spent in telling
                        of God. I have been setting forth His proofs, and teaching His Faith.” (The meaning
                        of teaching the Faith in the next world is spreading the sweet savors of holiness;
                        that action is the same as teaching.) We spoke together a little more, and then some
                        people arrived and he disappeared.

                        <a id="266138497" class="brl-location"></a>It happened that the turban which Salmán had on his head was similar to those worn
                        in <u>Sh</u>ú<u>sh</u>tar. As they were passing a crossroads, a man from <u>Sh</u>ú<u>sh</u>tar came out of his shop. He embraced Salmán and cried: “Where have you been, <u>Kh</u>ájih Muḥammad-‘Alí? When did you arrive? Welcome!”

                        <a id="968103639" class="brl-location"></a>“God forbid!” cried the man from <u>Sh</u>ú<u>sh</u>tar. “I know him well. <u>Kh</u>ájih Muḥammad-‘Alí is a God-fearing Muslim, a <u>Sh</u>í‘ih, a devout follower of the Imám ‘Alí.” With this he gave the farrá<u>sh</u> a sum of money and Salmán was freed.
                     </p>

                        <a id="860457199" class="brl-location"></a>They went into the shop and the merchant began to ask Salmán how he was faring. Salmán
                        told him: “I am not <u>Kh</u>ájih Muḥammad-‘Alí.”

                        <a id="628510340" class="brl-location"></a>Salmán immediately handed him the money, left, went out through the city gate and

                        after which he would retrace his steps, carrying Tablets to many cities, Iṣfahán,
                        <u>Sh</u>íráz, Ká<u>sh</u>án, Ṭihrán, and the rest.

                        delivering each one to him for whom it was intended. Every single year throughout
                        that long period, he came on foot from Persia to Iraq, or to Adrianople, or to the
                        Most Great Prison at ‘Akká; came with the greatest eagerness and love, and then went
                        back again.

                        <a id="344089987" class="brl-location"></a>He had remarkable powers of endurance. He traveled on foot, as a rule eating nothing
                        but onions and bread; and in all that time, he moved about in such a way that he was
                        never once held up and never once lost a letter or a Tablet. Every letter was safely
                        delivered; every Tablet reached its intended recipient. Over and over again, in Iṣfahán,
                        he was subjected to severe trials, but he remained patient and thankful under all
                        conditions, and earned from non-Bahá’ís the title of “the Bábís’ Angel Gabriel.”

                        <a id="877485805" class="brl-location"></a>Throughout his entire life, Salmán rendered this momentous service to the Cause of
                        God, becoming the means of its spread and contributing to the happiness of the believers,
                        annually bringing Divine glad tidings to the cities and villages of Persia. He was
                        close to the heart of Bahá’u’lláh, Who looked upon him with especial favor and grace.
                        Among the Holy Scriptures, there are Tablets revealed in his name.

                        the Cause with all his powers. Then, as before, he would come to the Most Great Prison
                        every year, delivering mail from the believers, and returning with the answers to
                        Persia. At last, in <u>Sh</u>íráz, he winged his way to the Kingdom of glory.

                        the outside. “Skew-Cap”<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#610036221">1</a></sup> and the Siyyid<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#831457570">2</a></sup> lived by the second gate of the city, and watched there at all times, day and night.
                        Whenever they spied a Bahá’í traveler they would hurry away to the Governor and tell
                        him that the traveler was bringing in letters and would carry the answers back. The
                        Governor would then arrest the traveler, seize his papers, jail him, and drive him
                        out. This became an established custom with the authorities and went on for a long
                        time—indeed, for nine years until, little by little, the practice was abandoned.

                        <a id="682306303" class="brl-location"></a>It was at such a period that the Afnán, Ḥájí Mírzá Muḥammad-‘Alí—that great bough
                        of the Holy Tree<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#185082128">3</a></sup>—journeyed to ‘Akká, coming from India to Egypt, and from Egypt to Marseilles. One
                        day I was up on the roof of the caravanserai. Some of the friends were with me and
                        I was walking up and down. It was sunset. At that moment, glancing at the distant
                        seashore, I observed that a carriage was approaching. “Gentlemen,” I said, “I feel
                        that a holy being is in that carriage.” It was still far away, hardly within sight.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="926237544" class="brl-location"></a>“Let us go to the gate,” I told them. “Although they will not allow us to pass through,
                        we can stand there till he comes.” I took one or two people with me and we left.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="395819823" class="brl-location"></a>At the city gate I called to the guard, privately gave him something and said: “A
                        carriage is coming in and I think it is bringing one of our friends. When it reaches
                        here, do not hold it up, and do not refer the matter to the Governor.” He put out
                        a chair for me and I sat down.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="926234798" class="brl-location"></a>By this time the sun had set. They had shut the main gate, too, but the little door
                        was open. The gatekeeper stayed outside, the carriage drew up, the gentleman had arrived.
                        What a radiant face he had! He was nothing but light from head to foot. Just to look
                        at that face made one happy; he was so confident, so assured, so rooted in his faith,
                        and his expression so joyous. He was truly a blessed being. He was a man who made
                        progress day by day, who added, every day, to his certitude and faith, his luminous
                        quality, his ardent love. He made extraordinary progress during the few days that
                        he spent in the Most Great Prison. The point is that when his carriage had come only
                        part of the way from Haifa to ‘Akká, one could already perceive his spirit, his light.

                     <p>
                        <a id="976893556" class="brl-location"></a>After he had received the endless bounties showered on him by Bahá’u’lláh, he was
                        given leave to go, and he traveled to China. There, over a considerable period, he
                        spent his days mindful of God and in a manner conformable to Divine good pleasure.
                        Later he went on to India, where he died.

                     <p>
                        <a id="293597691" class="brl-location"></a>The other revered Afnán and the friends in India felt it advisable to send his blessed
                        remains to Iraq, ostensibly to Najaf, to be buried near the Holy City; for the Muslims
                        had refused to let him lie in their graveyard, and his body had been lodged in a temporary
                        repository for safekeeping. Áqá Siyyid Asadu’lláh, who was in Bombay at the time,
                        was deputized to transport the remains with all due reverence to Iraq. There were
                        hostile Persians on the steamship and these people, once they reached Bú<u>sh</u>ihr, reported that the coffin of Mírzá Muḥammad-‘Alí the Bábí was being carried to
                        Najaf for burial in the Vale of Peace, near the sacred precincts of the Shrine, and
                        that such a thing was intolerable. They tried to take his blessed remains off the
                        ship, but they failed; see what the hidden Divine decrees can bring about.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="599468178" class="brl-location"></a>His body came as far as Basra. And since that was a period when the friends had to
                        remain in concealment, Siyyid Asadu’lláh was obliged to proceed as if he were going
                        on with the burial in Najaf, meanwhile hoping in one way or another to effect the
                        interment near Baghdad. Because, although Najaf is a holy city and always shall be,
                        still the friends had chosen another place. God, therefore, stirred up our enemies
                        to prevent the Najaf burial. They swarmed in, attacking the quarantine station to
                        lay hold of the body and either bury it in Basra or throw it into the sea or out on
                        the desert sands.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="411953363" class="brl-location"></a>The case took on such importance that in the end it proved impossible to bring the
                        remains to Najaf, and Siyyid Asadu’lláh had to carry them on to Baghdad. Here, too,
                        there was no burial place where the Afnán’s body would be safe from molestation at
                        enemy hands. Finally the Siyyid decided to carry it to the shrine of Persia’s Salmán
                        the Pure,<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#732844521">4</a></sup> about five farsa<u>kh</u>s out of Baghdad, and bury it in Ctesiphon, close to the grave of Salmán, beside the
                        palace of the Sásáníyán kings. The body was taken there and that trust of God was,
                        with all reverence, laid down in a safe resting-place by the palace of Naw<u>sh</u>íraván.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="451359143" class="brl-location"></a>And this was destiny, that after a lapse of thirteen hundred years, from the time
                        when the throne city of Persia’s ancient kings was trampled down, and no trace of
                        it was left, except for rubble and hills of sand, and the very palace roof itself
                        had cracked and split so that half of it toppled to the ground—this edifice should
                        win back the kingly pomp and splendor of its former days. It is indeed a mighty arch.
                        The width of its entry-way is fifty-two paces and it towers very high.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="520617234" class="brl-location"></a>Thus did God’s grace and favor encompass the Persians of an age long gone, in order
                        that their ruined capital should be rebuilt and flourish once again. To this end,
                        with the help of God, events were brought about which led to the Afnán’s being buried
                        here; and there is no doubt that a proud city will rise up on this site. I wrote many
                        letters about it, until at last the holy dust could be laid to rest in this place.
                        Siyyid Asadu’lláh would write me from Basra and I would answer him. One of the public
                        functionaries there was completely devoted to us, and I directed him to do all he
                        could. Siyyid Asadu’lláh informed me from Baghdad that he was at his wits’ end, and
                        had no idea where he could consign this body to the grave. “Wherever I might bury
                        it,” he wrote, “they will dig it up again.”
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="774504439" class="brl-location"></a>At last, praised be God, it was laid down in the very spot to which time and again
                        the Blessed Beauty had repaired; in that place honored by His footsteps, where He
                        had revealed Tablets, where the believers of Baghdad had been in His company; that
                        very place where the Most Great Name was wont to stroll. How did this come about?
                        It was due to the Afnán’s purity of heart. Lacking this, all those ways and means
                        could never have been brought to bear. Verily, God is the Mover of heaven and earth.
                     </p>

                        <a id="683583025" class="brl-location"></a>I loved the Afnán very much. Because of him, I rejoiced. I wrote a long Visitation
                        Tablet for him and sent it with other papers to Persia. His burial site is one of
                        the holy places where a magnificent Ma<u>sh</u>riqu’l-A<u>dh</u>kár must be raised up. If possible, the actual arch of the royal palace should be
                        restored and become the House of Worship. The auxiliary buildings of the House of
                        Worship should likewise be erected there: the hospital, the schools and university,
                        the elementary school, the refuge for the poor and indigent; also the haven for orphans
                        and the helpless, and the travelers’ hospice.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="181969965" class="brl-location"></a>Gracious God! That royal edifice was once splendidly decked forth and fair. But there
                        are spiders’ webs today, where hung the curtains of gold brocade, and where the king’s
                        drums beat and his musicians played, the only sound is the harsh cries of kites and
                        crows. “This is verily the capital of the owl’s realm, where thou wilt hear no sound,
                        save only the echo of his repeated calls.” That is how the barracks were, when we
                        came to ‘Akká. There were a few trees inside the walls, and on their branches, as
                        well as up on the battlements, the owls cried all night long. How disquieting is the
                        hoot of an owl; how it saddens the heart.
                     </p>

                        <a id="504541389" class="brl-location"></a>From earliest youth until he grew helpless and old, that sacred bough of the Holy
                        Tree, with his smiling face, shone out like a lamp in the midst of all. Then he leapt
                        and soared to undying glory, and plunged into the ocean of light. Upon him be the
                        breathings of his Lord, the All-Merciful. Upon him, lapped in the waters of grace
                        and forgiveness, be the mercy and favor of God.

                        Ḥasan, the great Afnán, who during the latter days won the honor of emigrating and
                        of receiving the favor and companionship of his Lord. The Afnán, related to the Báb,
                        was specifically named by the Supreme Pen as an offshoot of the Holy Tree. When still
                        a small child, he received his portion of bounty from the Báb, and showed forth an
                        extraordinary attachment to that dazzling Beauty. Not yet adolescent, he frequented
                        the society of the learned, and began to study sciences and arts. He reflected day
                        and night on the most abstruse of spiritual questions, and gazed in wonderment at
                        the mighty signs of God as written in the Book of Life. He became thoroughly versed
                        even in such material sciences as mathematics, geometry, and geography; in brief,
                        he was well grounded in many fields, thoroughly conversant with the thought of ancient

                        phrases, he could solve perplexing questions. His speech was laconic, but in itself

                        separation from Bahá’u’lláh, when his distinguished son became, by marriage, a member
                        of the Holy Household. At this, the Afnán rejoiced. He left Persia and hastened to
                        the sheltering favor of his Well-Beloved. He was a man amazing to behold, his face
                        so luminous that even those who were not believers used to say that a heavenly light

                        the East. Later on, the Afnán returned to the Holy Land, settling near the Mansion
                        of Bahjí and directing all his thoughts toward aspects of human culture. Much of the
                        time he would occupy himself with uncovering the secrets of the heavens, contemplating
                        in their detail the movements of the stars. He had a telescope with which he would
                        make his observations every night. He lived a happy life, carefree and light of heart.
                        In the neighborhood of Bahá’u’lláh his days were blissful, his nights bright as the
                        first morning in spring.

                        <a id="566075942" class="brl-location"></a>But then came the Beloved’s departure from this world. The Afnán’s peace was shattered,
                        his joy was changed to grief. The Supreme Affliction was upon us, separation consumed
                        us, the once bright days turned black as night, and all those roses of other hours
                        were dust and rubble now. He lived on for a little while, his heart smoldering, his
                        eyes shedding their tears. But he could not bear the longing for his Well-Beloved,
                        and in a little while his soul gave up this life and fled to the eternal one, passed
                        into the Heaven of abiding reunion and was immersed beneath an ocean of light. Upon
                        him be most great mercy, plenteous bounty, and every blessing, as the ages and cycles
                        roll on. His honored tomb is in ‘Akká at the Man<u>sh</u>íyyih.

                        from its very beginning. He was one of the mystics; his house was a gathering place
                        for them, and the philosophers. Noble, high-minded, he was one of Iṣfahán’s most respected
                        citizens, and served as a host and sanctuary for every stranger, rich or poor. He
                        had verve, an excellent disposition, was forbearing, affable, generous, a boon companion;
                        and it was known throughout the city that he enjoyed a good time.
                     </p>

                        <a id="646855587" class="brl-location"></a>Then he was led to embrace the Faith and caught fire from the Sinaitic Tree. His house
                        became a teaching center, dedicated to the glory of God. Day and night the believers
                        flocked there, as to a lamp lit by heavenly love. Over a long period, the sacred verses
                        were chanted in that house and the clear proofs set forth. Although this was widely
                        known, Muḥammad-‘Alí was not molested, because he was a kinsman of the Imám-Jum‘ih
                        of Iṣfahán. Finally, however, things came to such a pass that the Imám-Jum‘ih himself
                        sent him away, telling him: “I can protect you no longer. You are in grave danger.
                        The best thing for you is to leave here, and go on a journey.”

                        <a id="231807139" class="brl-location"></a>He left his home then, went to Iraq, and entered the presence of the world’s Desired
                        One. He spent some time there, progressing every day; he had little to live on, but
                        was happy and content. A man of excellent disposition, he was congenial to believers
                        and others alike.

                        <a id="561583797" class="brl-location"></a>When Bahá’u’lláh and His retinue left Baghdad for Constantinople, Muḥammad-‘Alí was
                        in His company, and continued on with Him to the Land of Mystery, Adrianople. Not
                        one to be inconstant, he maintained his characteristic immutability of heart. Whatever
                        happened, he remained the same. In Adrianople as well, his days passed happily, under
                        the protection of Bahá’u’lláh. He would carry on some business which, however trifling,
                        would bring in surprisingly abundant returns.

                        put in jail there, and was numbered among Bahá’u’lláh’s fellow captives for the rest
                        of his life, achieving that greatest of all distinctions, to be in prison with the
                        Blessed Beauty.

                        <a id="279388930" class="brl-location"></a>He spent his days in utter bliss. Here, too, he carried on a small business, which
                        occupied him from morning till noon. In the afternoons he would take his samovar,
                        wrap it in a dark-colored pouch made from a saddlebag, and go off somewhere to a garden
                        or meadow, or out in a field, and have his tea. Sometimes he would be found at the
                        farm of Mazra‘ih, or again in the Riḍván Garden; or, at the Mansion, he would have
                        the honor of attending upon Bahá’u’lláh.

                        <a id="643662122" class="brl-location"></a>Muḥammad-‘Alí would carefully consider every blessing that came his way. “How delicious
                        my tea is today,” he would comment. “What perfume, what color! How lovely this meadow
                        is, and the flowers so bright!” He used to say that everything, even air and water,
                        had its own special fragrance. For him the days passed in indescribable delight. Even
                        kings were not so happy as this old man, the people said. “He is completely free of
                        the world,” they would declare. “He lives in joy.” It also happened that his food
                        was of the very best, and that his home was situated in the very best part of ‘Akká.
                        Gracious God! Here he was, a prisoner, and yet experiencing comfort, peace and joy.

                        <a id="329233684" class="brl-location"></a>Muḥammad-‘Alí was past eighty when he finally departed to eternal light. He had been
                        the recipient of many Tablets from Bahá’u’lláh, and of endless bounty, under all conditions.
                        Upon him be the glory of God the Most Glorious. Upon him be myriads of heavenly blessings;
                        may God favor him with gladness forever and ever. His luminous grave is in ‘Akká.

                        This excellent soul, a child of early believers, came from Iṣfahán. His noble-hearted
                        father died, and this child grew up an orphan. There was none to rear or care for
                        him and he was the prey of anyone who chose to do him harm. At last he became adolescent,
                        and older now, sought out his Well-Beloved. He emigrated to the Most Great Prison
                        and here, at the Riḍván, achieved the honor of being appointed gardener. At this task
                        he was second to none. In his faith, too, he was staunch, loyal, worthy of trust;
                        as to his character, he was an embodiment of the sacred verse, “Of a noble nature
                        art thou.”<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#003634869">1</a></sup> That is how he won the distinction of being gardener at the Riḍván, and of thus receiving
                        the greatest bounty of all: almost daily, he entered the presence of Bahá’u’lláh.
                     </p>

                        <a id="246345587" class="brl-location"></a>For the Most Great Name was held prisoner and confined nine years in the fortress-town
                        of ‘Akká; and at all times, both in the barracks and afterward, from without the house,
                        the police and farrá<u>sh</u>es had Him under constant guard. The Blessed Beauty lived in a very small house, and
                        He never set foot outside that narrow lodging, because His oppressors kept continual
                        watch at the door. When, however, nine years had elapsed, the fixed and predetermined
                        length of days was over; and at that time, against the rancorous will of the tyrant,
                        ‘Abdu’l-Ḥamíd, and all his minions, Bahá’u’lláh proceeded out of the fortress with
                        authority and might, and in a kingly mansion beyond the city, made His home.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="475678412" class="brl-location"></a>Although the policy of Sulṭán ‘Abdu’l-Ḥamíd was harsher than ever; although he constantly
                        insisted on his Captive’s strict confinement—still, the Blessed Beauty now lived,
                        as everyone knows, with all power and glory. Some of the time Bahá’u’lláh would spend
                        at the Mansion, and again, at the farm village of Mazra‘ih; for a while He would sojourn
                        in Haifa, and occasionally His tent would be pitched on the heights of Mount Carmel.
                        Friends from everywhere presented themselves and gained an audience. The people and
                        the government authorities witnessed it all, yet no one so much as breathed a word.
                        And this is one of Bahá’u’lláh’s greatest miracles: that He, a captive, surrounded
                        Himself with panoply and He wielded power. The prison changed into a palace, the jail
                        itself became a Garden of Eden. Such a thing has not occurred in history before; no
                        former age has seen its like: that a man confined to a prison should move about with
                        authority and might; that one in chains should carry the fame of the Cause of God
                        to the high heavens, should win splendid victories in both East and West, and should,
                        by His almighty pen, subdue the world. Such is the distinguishing feature of this
                        supreme Theophany.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="730507730" class="brl-location"></a>One day the government leaders, pillars of the country, the city’s ‘ulamás, leading
                        mystics and intellectuals came out to the Mansion. The Blessed Beauty paid them no
                        attention whatever. They were not admitted to His presence, nor did He inquire after
                        any of them. I sat down with them and kept them company for some hours, after which
                        they returned whence they had come. Although the royal farmán specifically decreed
                        that Bahá’u’lláh was to be held in solitary confinement within the ‘Akká fortress,
                        in a cell, under perpetual guard; that He was never to set foot outside; that He was
                        never even to see any of the believers—notwithstanding such a farmán, such a drastic
                        order, His tent was raised in majesty on the heights of Mount Carmel. What greater
                        display of power could there be than this, that from the very prison, the banner of
                        the Lord was raised aloft, and rippled out for all the world to see! Praised be the
                        Possessor of such majesty and might; praised be He, weaponed with the power and the
                        glory; praised be He, Who defeated His foes when He lay captive in the ‘Akká prison!
                     </p>

                        <a id="964990562" class="brl-location"></a>To resume: ‘Abdu’ṣ-Ṣáliḥ lived under a fortunate star, for he regularly came into
                        the presence of Bahá’u’lláh. He enjoyed the distinction of serving as gardener for
                        many years, and he was at all times loyal, true, and strong in faith. He was humble
                        in the presence of every one of the believers; in all that time he never hurt nor
                        offended any one. And at the last he left his garden and hastened to the encompassing
                        mercy of God.

                        a Visitation Tablet in his honor, also delivering an address concerning him, which
                        was taken down and published together with other Scriptures.

                        best I could. But the <u>Sh</u>áh has found out about you and you know what a bloodthirsty tyrant he is. I am afraid
                        that he will seize you without warning, and he will hang you. The best thing for you
                        is to go on a journey. Leave this country, go somewhere else, and escape from this
                        peril.”
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="184462012" class="brl-location"></a>Composed, happy, Ustád gave up his work, closed his eyes to his possessions, and left
                        for Iraq, where he lived in poverty. He had recently taken a bride, and loved her
                        beyond measure. Her mother arrived, and by subterfuge, obtained his permission to
                        conduct the daughter back to Ṭihrán, supposedly for a visit. As soon as she reached
                        Kirmán<u>sh</u>áh, she went to the mujtahid, and told him that because her son-in-law had abandoned
                        his religion, her daughter could not remain his lawful wife. The mujtahid arranged
                        a divorce, and wedded the girl to another man. When word of this reached Baghdad,
                        Ismá‘íl, steadfast as ever, only laughed. “God be praised!” he said. “Nothing is left
                        me on this pathway. I have lost everything, including my bride. I have been able to
                        give Him all I possessed.”

                        When Bahá’u’lláh departed from Baghdad, and traveled to Rumelia, the friends remained
                        behind. The inhabitants of Baghdad then rose up against those helpless believers,
                        sending them away as captives to Mosul. Ustád was old and feeble, but he left on foot,
                        with no provisions for his journey, crossed over mountains and deserts, valleys and
                        hills, and in the end arrived at the Most Great Prison. At one time, Bahá’u’lláh had
                        written down an ode of Rúmí’s for him, and had told him to turn his face toward the
                        Báb and sing the words, set to a melody. And so as he wandered through the long dark
                        nights, Ustád would sing these lines:

                        to his one true Love. By stealth, he approached the Fortress and went in, but he was
                        exhausted, spent. He remained for some days, and came into the presence of Bahá’u’lláh,
                        after which he was directed to look for a lodging in Haifa. He got himself to Haifa,
                        but he found no haven there, no nest or hole, no water, no grain of corn. Finally
                        he made his home in a cave outside the town. He acquired a little tray and on this
                        he set out rings of earthenware, and some thimbles, pins and other trinkets. Every
                        day, from morning till noon, he peddled these, wandering about. Some days his earnings
                        would amount to twenty paras,<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#381117706">2</a></sup> some days thirty; and forty on his best days. Then he would go home to the cave and
                        content himself with a piece of bread. He was always voicing his thanks, always saying,
                        “Praise be to God that I have attained such favor and grace; that I have been separated
                        from friend and stranger alike, and have taken refuge in this cave. Now I am of those

                        was the great Nabíl.<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#245377736">1</a></sup> In the flower of youth he bade farewell to his family in Zarand and with Divine aid
                        began to teach the Faith. He became a chief of the army of lovers, and on his quest
                        he left Persian Iraq for Mesopotamia, but could not find the One he sought. For the
                        Well-Beloved was then in Kurdistán, living in a cave at Sar-Galú; and there, entirely
                        alone in that wasteland, with no companion, no friend, no listening soul, He was communing
                        with the beauty that dwelt in His own heart. All news of Him was completely cut off;
                        Iraq was eclipsed, and in mourning.

                        was almost out, that the believers were few, that Yaḥyá<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#774881289">2</a></sup> had crawled into a secret hole where he lay torpid and inert, and that a wintry cold
                        had taken over—he found himself obliged to leave, bitterly grieving, for Karbilá.
                        There he stayed until the Blessed Beauty returned from Kurdistán, making His way to
                        Baghdad. At that time there was boundless joy; every believer in the country sprang
                        to life; among them was Nabíl, who hastened to the presence of Bahá’u’lláh, and became
                        the recipient of great bestowals. He spent his days in gladness now, writing odes
                        to celebrate the praises of his Lord. He was a gifted poet, and his tongue most eloquent;
                        a man of mettle, and on fire with passionate love.

                        on to Persia. Because he associated with Siyyid Muḥammad he was led into error and
                        sorely afflicted and tried; but like the shooting stars, he became as a missile to
                        drive off satanic imaginings,<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#136623454">3</a></sup> and he repulsed the evil whisperers and went back to Baghdad, where he found rest
                        in the shade of the Holy Tree. He was later directed to visit Kirmán<u>sh</u>áh. He returned again, and on every journey was enabled to render a service.

                        <a id="470693097" class="brl-location"></a>Bahá’u’lláh and His retinue then left Baghdad, the “Abode of Peace,” for Constantinople,
                        the “City of Islám.” After His departure, Nabíl put on the dress of a dervish, and
                        set out on foot, catching up with the convoy along the way. In Constantinople he was
                        directed to return to Persia and there teach the Cause of God; also to travel throughout
                        the country, and acquaint the believers in its cities and villages with all that had
                        taken place. When this mission was accomplished, and the drums of “Am I not your Lord?”
                        were rolling out—for it was the “year eighty”<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#897895295">4</a></sup>—Nabíl hurried to Adrianople, crying as he went, “Yea verily Thou art! Yea verily!”
                        and “Lord, Lord, here am I!”

                        <a id="565992315" class="brl-location"></a>He entered Bahá’u’lláh’s presence and drank of the red wine of allegiance and homage.
                        He was then given specific orders to travel everywhere, and in every region to raise
                        the call that God was now made manifest: to spread the blissful tidings that the Sun
                        of Truth had risen. He was truly on fire, driven by restive love. With great fervor
                        he would pass through a country, bringing this best of all messages and reviving the
                        hearts. He flamed like a torch in every company, he was the star of every assemblage,
                        to all who came he held out the intoxicating cup. He journeyed as to the beat of drums
                        and at last he reached the ‘Akká fortress.

                        <a id="731451830" class="brl-location"></a>In those days the restrictions were exceptionally severe. The gates were shut, the
                        roads closed off. Wearing a disguise, Nabíl arrived at the ‘Akká gate. Siyyid Muḥammad
                        and his wretched accomplice immediately hurried to the Governorate and informed against
                        the traveler. “He is a Persian,” they reported. “He is not, as he seems, a man of
                        Bu<u>kh</u>árá. He has come here to seek for news of Bahá’u’lláh.” The authorities expelled him
                        at once.

                        <a id="833942995" class="brl-location"></a>Nabíl, despairing, withdrew to the town of Ṣafad. Later he came on to Haifa, where
                        he made his home in a cave on Mount Carmel. He lived apart from friend and stranger
                        alike, lamenting night and day, moaning and chanting prayers. There he remained as
                        a recluse, and waited for the doors to open. When the predestined time of captivity
                        was over, and the gates were flung wide, and the Wronged One issued forth in beauty,
                        in majesty and glory, Nabíl hastened to Him with a joyful heart. Then he used himself
                        up like a candle, burning away with the love of God. Day and night he sang the praises
                        of the one Beloved of both worlds and of those about His threshold, writing verses
                        in the pentameter and hexameter forms, composing lyrics and long odes. Almost daily,
                        he was admitted to the presence of the Manifestation.<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#095765185">5</a></sup>

                        shattering calamity, Nabíl sobbed and trembled and cried out to Heaven. He found that
                        the numerical value of the word “<u>sh</u>idád”—year of stress—was 309, and it thus became evident that Bahá’u’lláh foretold
                        what had now come to pass.<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#661010179">6</a></sup>

                        tears, Nabíl was in such anguish that anyone seeing him was bewildered. He struggled
                        on, but the only desire he had was to lay down his life. He could suffer no longer;
                        his longing was aflame in him; he could stand the fiery pain no more. And so he became
                        king of the cohorts of love, and he rushed into the sea.

                        <a id="841984904" class="brl-location"></a>Before that day when he offered himself up, he wrote out the year of his death in
                        the one word: “Drowned.”<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#232833176">7</a></sup> Then he threw down his life for the Well-Beloved, and was released from his despair,
                        and no longer shut away.

                        <a id="600949374" class="brl-location"></a>This distinguished man was erudite, wise, and eloquent of speech. His native genius
                        was pure inspiration, his poetic gift like a crystal stream. In particular his ode
                        “Bahá, Bahá!” was written in sheer ecstasy. Throughout all his life, from earliest
                        youth till he was feeble and old, he spent his time serving and worshiping the Lord.
                        He bore hardships, he lived through misfortunes, he suffered afflictions. From the
                        lips of the Manifestation he heard marvelous things. He was shown the lights of Paradise;
                        he won his dearest wish. And at the end, when the Daystar of the world had set, he
                        could endure no more, and flung himself into the sea. The waters of sacrifice closed
                        over him; he was <span class="brl-italic">drowned</span>, and he came, at last, to the Most High.

                        and were put in the Prison. He was a dervish; a man who lived free and detached from
                        friend and stranger alike. He belonged to the mystic element and was a man of letters.
                        He spent some time wearing the dress of poverty, drinking the wine of the Rule and
                        traveling the Path,<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#818514567">1</a></sup> but unlike the other Ṣúfís he did not devote his life to dusty hashish; on the contrary,
                        he cleansed himself of their vain imaginings and only searched for God, spoke of God,
                        and followed the path of God.

                        He had a fine poetic gift and wrote odes to sing the praises of Him Whom the world
                        has wronged and rejected. Among them is a poem written while he was a prisoner in
                        the barracks at ‘Akká, the chief couplet of which reads:
                        <span class="brl-linegroup brl-global-verse brl-italic brl-topmargin brl-btmmargin">
                           <span class="brl-linegroupline">A hundred hearts Thy curling locks ensnare,</span>

                        <a id="793307998" class="brl-location"></a>That free and independent soul discovered, in Baghdad, a trace of the untraceable
                        Beloved. He witnessed the dawning of the Daystar above the horizon of Iraq, and received
                        the bounty of that sunrise. He came under the spell of Bahá’u’lláh, and was enraptured
                        by that tender Companion. Although he was a quiet man, one who held his peace, his
                        very limbs were like so many tongues crying out their message. When the retinue of
                        Bahá’u’lláh was about to leave Baghdad he implored permission to go along as a groom.
                        All day, he walked beside the convoy, and when night came he would attend to the horses.
                        He worked with all his heart. Only after midnight would he seek his bed and lie down
                        to rest; the bed, however, was his mantle, and the pillow a sun-dried brick.

                        <a id="460524323" class="brl-location"></a>As he journeyed, filled with yearning love, he would sing poems. He greatly pleased
                        the friends. In him the name<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#201851794">2</a></sup> bespoke the man: he was pure candor and truth; he was love itself; he was chaste
                        of heart, and enamored of Bahá’u’lláh. In his high station, that of groom, he reigned
                        like a king; indeed he gloried over the sovereigns of the earth. He was assiduous
                        in attendance upon Bahá’u’lláh; in all things, upright and true.

                        <a id="222784893" class="brl-location"></a>The convoy of the lovers went on; it reached Constantinople; it passed to Adrianople,
                        and finally to the ‘Akká prison. Ṣidq-‘Alí was present throughout, faithfully serving
                        its Commander.

                        <a id="251675144" class="brl-location"></a>While in the barracks, Bahá’u’lláh set apart a special night and He dedicated it to
                        Darví<u>sh</u> Ṣidq-‘Alí. He wrote that every year on that night the dervishes should bedeck a meeting
                        place, which should be in a flower garden, and gather there to make mention of God.
                        He went on to say that “dervish” does not denote those persons who wander about, spending
                        their nights and days in fighting and folly; rather, He said, the term designates
                        those who are completely severed from all but God, who cleave to His laws, are firm
                        in His Faith, loyal to His Covenant, and constant in worship. It is not a name for
                        those who, as the Persians say, tramp about like vagrants, are confused, unsettled
                        in mind, a burden to others, and of all mankind the most coarse and rude.

                        <a id="736087479" class="brl-location"></a>This eminent dervish spent his whole life span under the sheltering favor of God.
                        He was completely detached from worldly things. He was attentive in service, and waited
                        upon the believers with all his heart. He was a servant to all of them, and faithful
                        at the Holy Threshold.
                     </p>

                        <a id="455343732" class="brl-location"></a>Then came that hour when, not far from his Lord, he stripped off the cloak of life,
                        and to physical eyes passed into the shadows, but to the mind’s eye betook himself
                        to what is plain as day; and he was seated there on a throne of lasting glory. He
                        escaped from the prison of this world, and pitched his tent in a wide and spacious
                        land. May God ever keep him close and bless him in that mystic realm with perpetual
                        reunion and the beatific vision; may he be wrapped in tiers of light. Upon him be
                        the glory of God, the All-Glorious. His grave is in ‘Akká.

                        by Divine bestowals from childhood on, they succeeded in rendering every kind of service
                        for fifty-five years. Their services were countless, beyond recording.

                        by a great crowd of people. Along the way, they met with famine conditions. These
                        two souls strode along on foot, ahead of the howdah in which Bahá’u’lláh was riding,
                        and covered a distance of seven or eight farsa<u>kh</u>s every day. Wayworn and faint, they would reach the halting-place; and yet, weary
                        as they were, they would immediately set about preparing and cooking the food, and
                        seeing to the comfort of the believers. The efforts they made were truly more than
                        flesh can bear. There were times when they had not more than two or three hours sleep
                        out of the twenty-four; because, once the friends had eaten their meal, these two
                        would be busy collecting and washing up the dishes and cooking utensils; this would
                        take them till midnight, and only then would they rest. At daybreak they would rise,
                        pack everything, and set out again, in front of the howdah of Bahá’u’lláh. See what
                        a vital service they were able to render, and for what bounty they were singled out:
                        from the start of the journey, at Baghdad, to the arrival in Constantinople, they
                        walked close beside Bahá’u’lláh; they made every one of the friends happy; they brought
                        rest and comfort to all; they prepared whatever anyone asked.

                        <a id="892656938" class="brl-location"></a>Áqá Riḍá and Mírzá Maḥmúd were the very essence of God’s love, utterly detached from
                        all but God. In all that time no one ever heard either of them raise his voice. They
                        never hurt nor offended anyone. They were trustworthy, loyal, true. Bahá’u’lláh showered
                        blessings upon them. They were continually entering His presence and He would be expressing
                        His satisfaction with them.

                        <a id="440171969" class="brl-location"></a>Mírzá Maḥmúd was a youth when he arrived in Baghdad from Ká<u>sh</u>án. Áqá Riḍá became a believer in Baghdad. The spiritual condition of the two was
                        indescribable. There was in Baghdad a company of seven leading believers who lived
                        in a single, small room, because they were destitute. They could hardly keep body
                        and soul together, but they were so spiritual, so blissful, that they thought themselves
                        in Heaven. Sometimes they would chant prayers all night long, until the day broke.
                        Days, they would go out to work, and by nightfall one would have earned ten paras,
                        another perhaps twenty paras, others forty or fifty. These sums would be spent for
                        the evening meal. On a certain day one of them made twenty paras, while the rest had
                        nothing at all. The one with the money bought some dates, and shared them with the
                        others; that was dinner, for seven people. They were perfectly content with their
                        frugal life, supremely happy.
                     </p>

                        <a id="135112463" class="brl-location"></a>These two honored men devoted their days to all that is best in human life: they had
                        seeing eyes; they were mindful and aware; they had hearing ears, and were fair of
                        speech. Their sole desire was to please Bahá’u’lláh. To them, nothing was a bounty
                        at all, except service at His Holy Threshold. After the time of the Supreme Affliction,
                        they were consumed with sorrow, like candles flickering away; they longed for death,
                        and stayed firm in the Covenant and labored hard and well to spread that Daystar’s
                        Faith. They were close and trusted companions of ‘Abdu’l‑Bahá, and could be relied
                        on in all things. They were always lowly, humble, unassuming, evanescent. In all that
                        long period, they never uttered a word which had to do with self.

                        <a id="152137946" class="brl-location"></a>And at the last, during the absence of ‘Abdu’l‑Bahá, they took their flight to the
                        Kingdom of unfading glory. I sorrowed much because I was not with them when they died.
                        Although absent in body, I was there in my heart, and mourning over them; but to outward
                        seeming I did not bid them good-by; this is why I grieve.

                        rose full-blown. He arrived there, in Baghdad, and spent his days and nights communing
                        with God and chanting prayers; and although he walked the earth, he traveled the heights
                        of Heaven.

                        and bázárs, and thieves would rob him of his merchandise. Finally he was obliged to
                        lay the socks across his outstretched palms as he went along. But he would get to

                        for he journeyed through another. He dwelt in ecstasy; he was a man drunken, bedazzled.

                        of the potent king.”<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#862909008">1</a></sup>

                        <a id="766520313" class="brl-location"></a>It was during the Iraq period that he hastened to the presence of Bahá’u’lláh. His
                        detachment from the things of this world and his attachment to the life of the spirit
                        are indescribable. He was love embodied, tenderness personified. Day and night, he
                        commemorated God. Utterly unconscious of this world and all that is therein, he dwelt
                        continually on God, remaining submerged in supplications and prayers. Most of the
                        time, tears poured from his eyes. The Blessed Beauty singled him out for special favor,
                        and whenever He turned His attention toward Ṣádiq, His loving-kindness was clear to
                        see.
                     </p>

                        <a id="006649430" class="brl-location"></a>On a certain day they brought word that Ṣádiq was at the point of death. I went to
                        his bedside and found him breathing his last. He was suffering from ileus, an abdominal
                        pain and swelling. I hurried to Bahá’u’lláh and described his condition.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="461926493" class="brl-location"></a>“Go,” He said. “Place your hand on the distended area and speak the words: ‘O Thou

                        <a id="505276221" class="brl-location"></a>I went back. I saw that the affected part had swollen up to the size of an apple;
                        it was hard as stone, in constant motion, twisting, and coiling about itself like
                        a snake. I placed my hand upon it; I turned toward God and, humbly beseeching Him,
                        I repeated the words, “O Thou the Healer!” Instantly the sick man rose up. The ileus
                        vanished; the swelling was carried off.
                     </p>

                        <a id="449672482" class="brl-location"></a>This personified spirit lived contentedly in Iraq until the day when Bahá’u’lláh’s
                        convoy wended its way out of Baghdad. As bidden, Ṣádiq remained behind in that city.
                        But his longing beat so passionately within him that after the arrival of Bahá’u’lláh
                        at Mosul, he could endure the separation no more. Shoeless, hatless, he ran out alongside
                        the courier going to Mosul; ran and ran until, on that barren plain, with mercy all
                        about him, he fell to his rest.

                        <u>Sh</u>áh-Muḥammad, who had the title of Amín, the Trusted One, was among the earliest of
                        believers, and most deeply enamored. He had listened to the Divine summons in the
                        flower of his youth, and set his face toward the Kingdom. He had ripped from his gaze
                        the veils of idle suppositions and had won his heart’s desire; neither the fancies
                        current among the people nor the reproaches of which he was the target turned him
                        back. Unshaken, he stood and faced a sea of troubles; staunch with the strength of
                        the Advent day, he confronted those who tried to thwart him and block his path. The
                        more they sought to instill doubts in his mind, the stronger he became; the more they
                        tormented him, the more progress he made. He was a captive of the face of God, enslaved
                        by the beauty of the All-Glorious; a flame of God’s love, a jetting fountain of the
                        knowledge of Him.
                     </p>

                        <a id="114478792" class="brl-location"></a>Love smoldered in his heart, so that he had no peace; and when he could bear the absence
                        of the Beloved One no more, he left his native home, the province of Yazd. He found
                        the desert sands like silk under his feet; light as the wind’s breath, he passed over
                        the mountains and across the endless plains, until he stood at the door of his Love.
                        He had freed himself from the snare of separation, and in Iraq, he entered the presence
                        of Bahá’u’lláh.
                     </p>

                        <a id="032704213" class="brl-location"></a>Once he made his way into the home of the Darling of mankind, he was emptied of every
                        thought, released from every concern, and became the recipient of boundless favor
                        and grace. He passed some days in Iraq and was directed to return to Persia. There
                        he remained for a time, frequenting the believers; and his pure breathings stirred
                        each one of them anew, so that each one yearned over the Faith, and became more restless,
                        more impatient than before.

                        <a id="377673236" class="brl-location"></a>Later he arrived at the Most Great Prison with Mírzá Abu’l-Ḥasan, the second Amín.
                        On this journey he met with severe hardships, for it was extremely difficult to find
                        a way into the prison. Finally he was received by Bahá’u’lláh in the public baths.
                        Mírzá Abu’l-Ḥasan was so overwhelmed at the majestic presence of his Lord that he
                        shook, stumbled, and fell to the floor; his head was injured and the blood flowed
                        out.

                        <a id="845071873" class="brl-location"></a>Amín, that is <u>Sh</u>áh-Muḥammad, was honored with the title of the Trusted One, and bounties were showered
                        upon him. Full of eagerness and love, taking with him Tablets from Bahá’u’lláh, he
                        hastened back to Persia, where, at all times worthy of trust, he labored for the Cause.
                        His services were outstanding, and he was a consolation to the believers’ hearts.
                        There was none to compare with him for energy, enthusiasm and zeal, and no man’s services
                        could equal his. He was a haven amidst the people, known everywhere for devotion to
                        the Holy Threshold, widely acclaimed by the friends.
                     </p>

                        <a id="535023240" class="brl-location"></a>He never rested for a moment. Not one night did he spend on a bed of ease, never did
                        he lay down his head on comfort’s pillow. He was continuously in flight, soaring as
                        the birds do, running like a deer, guesting in the desert of oneness, alone and swift.
                        He brought joy to all the believers; to all, his coming was good news; to every seeker,
                        he was a sign and token. He was enamored of God, a vagrant in the desert of God’s
                        love. Like the wind, he traveled over the face of the plains, and he was restive on
                        the heights of the hills. He was in a different country every day, and in yet another
                        land by nightfall. Never did he rest, never was he still. He was forever rising up
                        to serve.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="417431774" class="brl-location"></a>But then they took him prisoner in Á<u>dh</u>irbáyján, in the town of Míyándu’áb. He fell a prey to some ruthless Kurds, a hostile
                        band who asked no questions of the innocent, defenseless man. Believing that this
                        stranger, like other foreigners, wished ill to the Kurdish people, and taking him
                        for worthless, they killed him.

                        <a id="981932501" class="brl-location"></a>When news of his martyrdom reached the Prison, all the captives grieved, and they
                        shed tears for him, resigned to God and undefended as he was in his last hour. Even
                        on the countenance of Bahá’u’lláh, there were visible tokens of grief. A Tablet, infinitely
                        tender, was revealed by the Supreme Pen, commemorating the man who died on that calamitous
                        plain, and many other Tablets were sent down concerning him.

                        The memory and praise of him shall remain, till the end of time, in the pages of books

                        and Pollux, the two kept together in one spot, and both were illumined with the light
                        of belief.

                        the same conscience, and made their way out of Á<u>dh</u>irbáyján to Adrianople, emigrating at the same time. In every circumstance of their
                        life, they lived as one individual; their disposition, their aims, their religion,
                        character, behavior, faith, certitude, knowledge—all were one. Even in the Most Great

                        with the goods. Thus, in the pathway of God, he lost whatever he possessed. He passed
                        his days, perfectly content, in the Most Great Prison. He was utter selflessness;
                        from him, no one ever heard a syllable to indicate that he existed. He was always
                        in a certain corner of the prison, silently meditating, occupied with the remembrance

                        <a id="389799962" class="brl-location"></a>This distinguished man, Mullá Muḥammad-‘Alí,<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#648288842">1</a></sup> was one of those whose hearts were drawn to Bahá’u’lláh before the Declaration of
                        the Báb; it was then that he drank the red wine of knowledge from the hands of the
                        Cupbearer of grace. It happened that a prince, who was the son of Mír Asadu’lláh <u>Kh</u>án, prince of Qá’in, was commanded to remain as a political hostage in Ṭihrán. He
                        was young, far away from his loving father, and Mullá Muḥammad-‘Alí was his tutor
                        and guardian. Since the youth was a stranger in Ṭihrán, the Blessed Beauty showed
                        him special kindness. Many a night the young prince was Bahá’u’lláh’s guest at the
                        mansion, and Mullá Muḥammad-‘Alí would accompany him. This was prior to the Declaration
                        of the Báb.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="651092913" class="brl-location"></a>It was then that this chief of all trusted friends was captivated by Bahá’u’lláh,
                        and wherever he went, spread loving praise of Him. After the way of Islám, he also
                        related the great miracles which he had, with his own eyes, seen Bahá’u’lláh perform,
                        and the marvels he had heard. He was in ecstasy, burning up with love. In that condition,
                        he returned to Qá’in with the prince.
                     </p>

                        <a id="573680970" class="brl-location"></a>Later on that eminent scholar, Áqá Muḥammad of Qá’in (whose title was Nabíl-i-Akbar)
                        was made a mujtahid, a doctor of religious law, by the late <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Murtaḍá; he left, then, for Baghdad, became an ardent follower of Bahá’u’lláh, and
                        hastened back to Persia. The leading divines and mujtahids were well aware of and
                        acknowledged his vast scholarly accomplishments, the breadth of his learning, and
                        his high rank. When he reached Qá’in, he began openly to spread the new Faith. The
                        moment Mullá Muḥammad-‘Alí heard the name of the Blessed Beauty, he immediately accepted
                        the Báb. “I had the honor,” he said, “of meeting the Blessed Beauty in Ṭihrán. The
                        instant I saw Him, I became His slave.”
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="656809002" class="brl-location"></a>In his village of Sar-<u>Ch</u>áh, this gifted, high-minded man began to teach the Faith. He guided in his own family
                        and saw to the others as well, bringing a great multitude under the law of the love
                        of God, leading each one to the path of salvation.
                     </p>

                        <a id="062271508" class="brl-location"></a>Up to that time he had always been a close companion of Mír ‘Alam <u>Kh</u>án, the Governor of Qá’in, had rendered him important services, and had enjoyed the
                        Governor’s respect and trust. Now that shameless prince turned against him in a rage
                        on account of his religion, seized his property and plundered it; for the Amír was
                        terrified of Náṣiri’d-Dín <u>Sh</u>áh. He banished Nabíl-i-Akbar and ruined Nabíl of Qá’in. After throwing him in prison
                        and torturing him, he drove him out as a homeless vagrant.
                     </p>

                        <a id="535916433" class="brl-location"></a>To Nabíl, the sudden calamity was a blessing, the sacking of his earthly goods, the
                        expulsion into the desert, was a kingly crown and the greatest favor God could grant
                        him. For some time he remained in Ṭihrán, to outward seeming a pauper of no fixed
                        abode, but inwardly rejoicing; for this is the characteristic of every soul who is
                        firm in the Covenant.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="786227575" class="brl-location"></a>He had access to the society of the great and knew the condition of the various princes.
                        He would, therefore, frequent some of them and give them the message. He was a consolation
                        to the hearts of the believers and as a drawn sword to the enemies of Bahá’u’lláh.
                        He was one of those of whom we read in the Qur’án: “For the Cause of God shall they
                        strive hard; the blame of the blamer shall they not fear.”<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#251003325">2</a></sup> Day and night he toiled to promote the Faith, and with all his might to spread abroad
                        the clear signs of God. He would drink and drink again of the wine of God’s love,
                        was clamorous as the storm clouds, restless as the waves of the sea.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="889389729" class="brl-location"></a>Permission came, then, for him to visit the Most Great Prison; for in Ṭihrán, as a
                        believer, he had become a marked man. They all knew of his conversion; he had no caution,
                        no patience, no reserve; he cared nothing for reticence, nothing for dissimulation.
                        He was utterly fearless and in terrible danger.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="399911644" class="brl-location"></a>When he arrived at the Most Great Prison, the hostile watchers drove him off, and
                        try as he might he found no way to enter. He was obliged to leave for Nazareth, where
                        he lived for some time as a stranger, alone with his two sons, Áqá Qulám-Ḥusayn and
                        Áqá ‘Alí-Akbar, grieving and praying. At last a plan was devised to introduce him
                        into the fortress and he was summoned to the prison where they had immured the innocent.
                        He came in such ecstasy as cannot be described, and was admitted to the presence of
                        Bahá’u’lláh. When he entered there and lifted his eyes to the Blessed Beauty he shook
                        and trembled and fell unconscious to the floor. Bahá’u’lláh spoke words of loving-kindness
                        to him and he rose again. He spent some days hidden in the barracks, after which he
                        returned to Nazareth.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="778094801" class="brl-location"></a>The inhabitants of Nazareth wondered much about him. They told one another that he
                        was obviously a great and distinguished man in his own country, a notable and of high
                        rank; and they asked themselves why he should have chosen such an out-of-the-way corner
                        of the world as Nazareth and how he could be contented with such poverty and hardship.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="587382025" class="brl-location"></a>When, in fulfillment of the promise of the Most Great Name, the gates of the Prison
                        were flung wide, and all the friends and travelers could enter and leave the fortress-town
                        in peace and with respect, Nabíl of Qá’in would journey to see Bahá’u’lláh once in
                        every month. However, as commanded by Him, he continued to live in Nazareth, where
                        he converted a number of Christians to the Faith; and there he would weep, by day
                        and night, over the wrongs that were done to Bahá’u’lláh.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="868585202" class="brl-location"></a>His means of livelihood was his business partnership with me. That is, I provided
                        him with a capital of three krans;<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#075960245">3</a></sup> with it he bought needles, and this was his stock-in-trade. The women of Nazareth
                        gave him eggs in exchange for his needles and in this way he would obtain thirty or
                        forty eggs a day: three needles per egg. Then he would sell the eggs and live on the
                        proceeds. Since there was a daily caravan between ‘Akká and Nazareth, he would refer
                        to Áqá Riḍá each day, for more needles. Glory be to God! He survived two years on
                        that initial outlay of capital; and he returned thanks at all times. You can tell
                        how detached he was from worldly things by this one fact: the Nazarenes used to say
                        it was plain to see from the old man’s manner and behavior that he was very rich,
                        and that if he lived so modestly it was only because he was a stranger in a strange
                        place—hiding his wealth by setting up as a peddler of needles.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="299134353" class="brl-location"></a>Whenever he came into the presence of Bahá’u’lláh he received still more evidences
                        of favor and love. For all seasons, he was a close friend and companion to me. When
                        sorrows attacked me I would send for him, and then I would rejoice just to see him
                        again. How wonderful his talk was, how attractive his society. Bright of face he was;
                        free of heart; loosed from every earthly tie, always on the wing. Toward the end he
                        made his home in the Most Great Prison, and every day he entered the presence of Bahá’u’lláh.
                     </p>

                        <a id="739558026" class="brl-location"></a>On a certain day, walking through the bázár with his friends, he met a gravedigger
                        named Ḥájí Aḥmad. Although in the best of health, he addressed the gravedigger and
                        laughingly told him: “Come along with me.” Accompanied by the believers and the gravedigger
                        he made for Nabíyu’lláh Ṣáliḥ. Here he said: “O Ḥájí Aḥmad, I have a request to make
                        of you: when I move on, out of this world and into the next, dig my grave here, beside
                        the Purest Branch.<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#187467532">4</a></sup> This is the favor I ask.” So saying, he gave the man a gift of money.
                     </p>

                        <a id="246280201" class="brl-location"></a>That very evening, not long after sunset, word came that Nabíl of Qá’in had been taken
                        ill. I went to his home at once. He was sitting up, and conversing. He was radiant,
                        laughing, joking, but for no apparent reason the sweat was pouring off his face—it
                        was rushing down. Except for this he had nothing the matter with him. The perspiring
                        went on and on; he weakened, lay in his bed, and toward morning, died.
                     </p>

                        <a id="030855598" class="brl-location"></a>Bahá’u’lláh would refer to him with infinite grace and loving-kindness, and revealed
                        a number of Tablets in his name. The Blessed Beauty was wont, after Nabíl’s passing,
                        to recall that ardor, the power of that faith, and to comment that here was a man
                        who had recognized Him, prior to the advent of the Báb.

                        Heavenward, and his heart was flooded with light. Divine grace descended upon him;
                        the summons of God so enraptured him that he threw the peace of Man<u>sh</u>ád to the winds. Leaving his kinsfolk and children, he set out over mountains and
                        desert plains, passed from one halting-place to the next, came to the seashore, crossed
                        over the sea and at last reached the city of Haifa. From there he hastened on to ‘Akká
                        and entered the presence of Bahá’u’lláh.

                        <a id="342412050" class="brl-location"></a>In the early days he opened a small shop in Haifa and carried on some trifling business.
                        God’s blessing descended upon it, and it prospered. That little corner became the
                        haven of the pilgrims. When they arrived, and again at their departure, they were
                        guests of the high-minded and generous Muḥammad-Taqí. He also helped to manage the
                        affairs of the believers, and would get together their means of travel. He proved
                        unfailingly reliable, loyal, worthy of trust. Ultimately he became the intermediary
                        through whom Tablets could be sent away and mail from the believers could come in.
                        He performed this service with perfect dependability, accomplishing it in a most pleasing
                        way, scrupulously despatching and receiving the correspondence at all times. Trusted
                        by everyone, he became known in many parts of the world, and received unnumbered bounties
                        from Bahá’u’lláh. He was a treasury of justice and righteousness, entirely free from
                        any attachment to worldly things. He had accustomed himself to a very spare way of
                        life, caring nothing for food or sleep, comfort or peace. He lived all alone in a
                        single room, passed the nights on a couch of palm branches, and slept in a corner.
                        But to the travelers, he was a spring in the desert; for them, he provided the softest
                        of pillows, and the best table he could afford. He had a smiling face and by nature
                        was spiritual and serene.

                        how they showered favors on him and what honors they paid him, what feasts they prepared,
                        what pleasures they offered, all this to make a breach in his faith. Yet every day

                        unseemly thought, and shunned whatever went contrary to the Covenant of God. When
                        they finally despaired of shaking his resolve, they harassed him in every possible
                        way, and plotted his financial ruin. He remained, however, the quintessence of constancy
                        and trust.

                        <a id="241158504" class="brl-location"></a>When, at the instigation of the violators, ‘Abdu’l-Ḥámíd began his opposition to me,
                        I was obliged to send Man<u>sh</u>ádí away to Port Said, because he was widely known among the people as the distributor
                        of our mail. I then had to relay the correspondence to him through intermediaries
                        who were unknown, and he would send the letters on as before. In this way the treacherous
                        and the hostile were unable to take over the mail. During the latter days of ‘Abdu’l-Ḥámíd,
                        when a commission of investigation appeared and—urged on by those familiars-turned-strangers—made
                        plans to tear out the Holy Tree by the roots; when they determined to cast me into
                        the depths of the sea or banish me to the Fezzan, and this was their settled purpose;
                        and when the commission accordingly tried their utmost to get hold of some document
                        or other, they failed. In the thick of all that turmoil, with all the pressures and
                        restraints, and the foul attacks of those persons who were pitiless as Yazíd,<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#862030290">1</a></sup> still the mail went through.

                        <a id="875862238" class="brl-location"></a>For many long years, Siyyid Man<u>sh</u>ádí befittingly performed this service in Port Said. The friends were uniformly pleased
                        with him. In that city he earned the gratitude of travelers, placed those who had
                        emigrated in his debt, brought joy to the local believers. Then the heavy heat of
                        Egypt proved too much for him; he took to his bed, and in a raging fever, cast off
                        the robe of life. He abandoned Port Said for the Kingdom of Heaven, and rose up to
                        the mansions of the Lord.

                        <a id="578876857" class="brl-location"></a>Siyyid Man<u>sh</u>ádí was the essence of virtue and intellect. His qualities and attainments were such
                        as to amaze the most accomplished minds. He had no thought except of God, no hope
                        but to win the good pleasure of God. He was the embodiment of “Keep all my words of
                        prayer and praise confined to one refrain; make all my life but servitude to Thee.”

                        hindering veils and doubts, escaped from his delusions and hastened to the welcoming
                        shelter of the Lord of Lords. A man to outward seeming without education, for he could
                        neither read nor write, he was of sharp intelligence and a trustworthy friend. Through
                        one of the believers, he was brought into the presence of Bahá’u’lláh, and was soon
                        widely known to the public as a disciple. He found himself a corner to live in, close
                        beside the house of the Blessed Beauty, and mornings and evenings would enter the
                        presence of Bahá’u’lláh. For a time he was supremely happy.

                        <a id="394193917" class="brl-location"></a>When Bahá’u’lláh and His retinue left Baghdad for Constantinople, Áqá Muḥammad-‘Alí
                        was of that company, and fevered with the love of God. We reached Constantinople;
                        and since the Government obliged us to settle in Adrianople we left Muḥammad-‘Alí
                        in the Turkish capital to assist the believers as they came and went through that
                        city. We then went on to Adrianople. This man remained alone and he suffered intense
                        distress for he had no friend nor companion nor anyone to care for him.

                        <a id="630041007" class="brl-location"></a>After two years of this he came on to Adrianople, seeking a haven in the loving-kindness
                        of Bahá’u’lláh. He went to work as a peddler, and when the great rebellion<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#435742397">1</a></sup> began and the oppressors drove the friends to the extreme of adversity, he too was
                        among the prisoners and was exiled with us to the fortress at ‘Akká.

                        <a id="362034233" class="brl-location"></a>He spent a considerable time in the Most Great Prison, after which Bahá’u’lláh desired
                        him to leave for Sidon, where he engaged in trade. Sometimes he would return and be
                        received by Bahá’u’lláh, but otherwise he stayed in Sidon. He lived respected and
                        trusted, a credit to all. When the Supreme Affliction came upon us, he returned to
                        ‘Akká and passed the remainder of his days near the Holy Tomb.

                        was a kind man, an excellent one: content with God’s will for him, thankful, a man

                        was ‘Abdu’l-<u>Gh</u>affár of Iṣfahán. He was a highly perceptive individual who, on commercial business,
                        had traveled about Asia Minor for many years. He made a journey to Iraq, where Áqá
                        Muḥammad-‘Alí of Ṣád (Iṣfahán) brought him into the shelter of the Faith. He soon
                        ripped off the bandage of illusions that had blinded his eyes before, and he rose
                        up, winging to salvation in the Heaven of Divine love. With him, the veil had been
                        thin, almost transparent, and that is why, as the first word was imparted, he was
                        immediately released from the world of idle imaginings and attached himself to the
                        One Who is clear to see.

                        proficient. The journey came peacefully to an end and then, in the Great City, he
                        continued on, as a companion and friend. The same was true in Adrianople and also
                        when, as one of the prisoners, he accompanied us to the city of Haifa.

                        for help, for he longed to be with us in the Most Great Prison.<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#058336552">1</a></sup> When they held him back by force, from high up on the ship he threw himself into
                        the sea. This had no effect whatever on the brutal officers. After dragging him from
                        the water they held him prisoner on the ship, cruelly restraining him, and carrying
                        him away by force to Cyprus. He was jailed in Famagusta, but one way or another managed
                        to escape and hastened to ‘Akká. Here, protecting himself from the malevolence of
                        our oppressors, he changed his name to ‘Abdu’lláh. Sheltered within the loving-kindness
                        of Bahá’u’lláh, he passed his days at ease, and happy.

                        <a id="181633164" class="brl-location"></a>But when the world’s great Light had set, to shine on forever from the All-Luminous
                        Horizon, ‘Abdu’l-<u>Gh</u>affár was beside himself and a prey to anguish. He no longer had a home. He left for
                        Damascus and spent some time there, pent up in his sorrow, mourning by day and night.
                        He grew weaker and weaker. We despatched Ḥájí ‘Abbás there, to nurse him and give
                        him treatment and care, and send back word of him every day. But ‘Abdu’l-<u>Gh</u>affár would do nothing but talk, unceasingly, at every hour, with his nurse, and tell
                        how he longed to go his way, into the mysterious country beyond. And at the end, far
                        from home, exiled from his Love, he set out for the Holy Threshold of Bahá’u’lláh.

                        Upon arrival he fell ill, weakened, passed his hours in supplicating God. The breath

                        evanescent, submissive, poor, content with the will of God, in love with His guiding
                        Light, rejoicing over the great message. They left their province and traveled to
                        Adrianople. Here beside the holy city they lived for quite a time in the village of
                        Qumruq-Kilísá. By day, they supplicated God and communed with Him; by night, they
                        wept, bemoaning the plight of Him Whom the world hath wronged.

                        <a id="122831124" class="brl-location"></a>When the exile to ‘Akká was under way, they were not present in the city and thus
                        were not arrested. Heavy of heart, they continued on in that area, shedding their
                        tears. Once they had obtained a definite report from ‘Akká, they left Rumelia and
                        came here: two excellent souls, loyal bondsmen of the Blessed Beauty. It is impossible
                        to tell how translucent they were of heart, how firm in faith.
                     </p>

                        <a id="777053990" class="brl-location"></a>They lived outside ‘Akká in Bá<u>gh</u>-i-Firdaws, worked as farmers, and spent their days returning thanks to God because
                        once again they had won their way to the neighborhood of grace and love. But they
                        were natives of Á<u>dh</u>irbáyján, accustomed to the cold, and they could not endure the local heat. Furthermore,
                        this was during our early days in ‘Akká, when the air was noxious, and the water unwholesome
                        in the extreme. They both fell ill of a chronic, high fever. They bore it cheerfully,
                        with amazing patience. During their days of illness, despite the assault of the fever,
                        the violence of their ailment, the raging thirst, the restlessness, they remained
                        inwardly at peace, rejoicing at the Divine glad tidings. And at a time when they were
                        offering thanks with all their heart, they hurried away from this world and entered
                        the other; they escaped from this cage and were released into the garden of immortality.
                        Upon them be the mercy of God, and may He be well pleased with them. Unto them be
                        salutations and praise. May God bring them into the Realm that abides forever, to
                        delight in reunion with Him, to bask in the Kingdom of Splendors. Their two luminous
                        tombs are in ‘Akká.

                        God-fearing, and known among the people as a holy man, peerless in observing his religious
                        duties, mindful as to his acts. His strong religious faith was an indisputable fact.
                        He served and worshiped God by day and night, was sound, mild, compassionate, a loyal
                        friend.

                        <a id="765708603" class="brl-location"></a>Because he was fully prepared, at the very moment when he heard the summons from the
                        Supreme Horizon—heard the drumbeats of “Am I not your Lord?”—he instantly cried out,
                        “Yea, verily!” With his whole being, he became enamored of the splendors shed by the
                        Light of the World. Openly and boldly he began to confirm his family and friends.
                        This was soon known throughout the city; to the eyes of the evil ‘ulamás, he was now
                        an object of hate and contempt. Incurring their wrath, he was despised by those creatures
                        of their own low passions. He was molested and harassed; the inhabitants rioted, and
                        the evil ‘ulamás plotted his death. The government authorities turned on him as well,
                        hounded him, even subjected him to torture. They beat him with clubs, and whipped
                        him. All this went on, by day and night.

                        <a id="636864734" class="brl-location"></a>He was forced, then, to abandon his home and go out of the city, a vagrant, climbing
                        the mountains, crossing over the plains, until he came to the Holy Land. But so weak
                        he was, and wasted away, that whoever saw him thought he was breathing his last; when
                        he reached Haifa, Nabíl of Qá’in hurried to ‘Akká, and desired me to summon the Ḥájí
                        at once, because he was in his death agony and failing fast.
                     </p>

                        <a id="004355358" class="brl-location"></a>“Let me go to the Mansion,” I said, “and ask leave.”
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="596249138" class="brl-location"></a>“It would take too long,” he said. “And then ‘Abdu’r-Raḥím will never see ‘Akká. I
                        long for him to have this bounty; for him at least to see ‘Akká, and die. I beg of
                        You, send for him at once!”
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="577094801" class="brl-location"></a>Complying with his wish, I summoned ‘Abdu’r-Raḥím. When he came, I could hardly detect
                        in him a whisper of life. At times he would open his eyes, but he spoke no word. Still,
                        the sweet savors of the Most Great Prison restored the vital spark, and his yearning
                        to meet Bahá’u’lláh breathed life into him again. I looked in on him the next morning
                        and found him cheerful and refreshed. He asked permission to attend upon Bahá’u’lláh.
                        “It all depends,” I answered, “on whether He grants you leave. God willing, you shall
                        be singled out for this cherished gift.”
                     </p>

                        <a id="052235044" class="brl-location"></a>A few days later, permission came, and he hastened to the presence of Bahá’u’lláh.
                        When ‘Abdu’r-Raḥím entered there, the spirit of life was wafted over him. On his return,
                        it was clear that this Ḥájí had become a different Ḥájí entirely: he was in the bloom
                        of health. Nabíl was dumbfounded, and said: “How life-giving, to a true believer,
                        is this prison air!”
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="194313212" class="brl-location"></a>For some time, ‘Abdu’r-Raḥím lived in the neighborhood. He spent his hours remembering
                        and praising God; he chanted prayers, and carefully attended to his religious duties.
                        Thus he saw few people. This servant paid special attention to his needs, and ordered
                        a light diet for him. But it all came to an end with the Supreme Affliction, the ascension
                        of Bahá’u’lláh. There was anguish then, and the noise of loud weeping. With his heart
                        on fire, his eyes raining tears, he struggled weakly to move about; so his days went
                        by, and always, he longed to make his exit from this rubbish heap, the world. At last
                        he broke away from the torment of his loss, and hurried on to the Realm of God, and
                        came to the assemblage of Divine splendor in the Kingdom of Lights.

                        the Holy Land, and under the sheltering grace of Bahá’u’lláh found peace of heart.
                        He was a man confident, steadfast and firm; certain of the manifold bounties of God;
                        of an excellent disposition and character.

                        he went to <u>Gh</u>awr, near Tiberias, where he farmed, both tilling the soil and devoting much of his
                        time to supplicating and communing with God. He was an excellent man, high-minded

                        were fixed on the Abhá Kingdom; sometimes he would shed tears and moan, again he would
                        rejoice, glad because he had achieved his supreme desire. He was completely detached
                        from all but God, happy in God’s grace. He would keep a vigil most of the night, remaining
                        in a state of prayer. Then death came at the appointed hour, and in the shadowing
                        care of Bahá’u’lláh he ascended, hurried away from this world of dust to the high
                        Firmament, soared upward to the secret land. Unto him be salutations, mercy and praise,
                        in the neighborhood of his exalted Lord.

                        bookbinder, Muḥammad-Hádí. This noted man was from Iṣfahán, and as a binder and illuminator
                        of books he had no peer. When he gave himself up to the love of God he was alert on
                        the path and fearless. He abandoned his home and began a dreadful journey, passing
                        with extreme hardship from one country to another until he reached the Holy Land and
                        became a prisoner. He stationed himself by the Holy Threshold, carefully sweeping
                        it and keeping watch. Through his constant efforts, the square in front of Bahá’u’lláh’s
                        house was at all times swept, sprinkled and immaculate.

                        <a id="450684748" class="brl-location"></a>Bahá’u’lláh would often glance at that plot of ground, and then He would smile and
                        say: “Muḥammad-Hádí has turned the square in front of this prison into the bridal
                        bower of a palace. He has brought pleasure to all the neighbors and earned their thanks.”

                        <a id="153327935" class="brl-location"></a>When his sweeping, sprinkling and tidying was done, he would set to work illuminating
                        and binding the various books and Tablets. So his days went by, his heart happy in
                        the presence of the Beloved of mankind. He was an excellent soul, righteous, true,
                        worthy of the bounty of being united with his Lord, and free of the world’s contagion.

                        <a id="527734462" class="brl-location"></a>One day he came to me and complained of a chronic ailment. “I have suffered from chills
                        and fever for two years,” he said. “The doctors have prescribed a purgative, and quinine.
                        The fever stops a few days; then it returns. They give me more quinine, but still
                        the fever returns. I am weary of this life, and can no longer do my work. Save me!”

                        <a id="095593118" class="brl-location"></a>Jokingly, I named off the different dishes. When I came to barley soup with whey (á<u>sh</u>-i-ka<u>sh</u>k), he said, “Very good! But on condition there is braised garlic in it.”

                        <a id="911803263" class="brl-location"></a>I directed them to prepare this for him, and I left. The next day he presented himself

                        I hurried to his bedside and found him with a fever of 42° Centigrade. He was barely
                        conscious. “What has he done?” I asked. “When he became feverish,” was the reply,
                        “he said that he knew from experience what he should do. Then he ate his fill of barley
                        soup with whey and braised garlic; and this was the result.”
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="999853611" class="brl-location"></a>I was astounded at the workings of fate. I told them: “Because, two years ago, he
                        had been thoroughly purged and his system was clear; because he had a hearty appetite
                        for it, and his ailment was fever and chills, I prescribed the barley soup. But this
                        time, with the different foods he has had, with no appetite, and especially with a
                        high fever, there was no reason to diagnose the previous chronic condition. How could
                        he have eaten the soup!” They answered, “It was fate.” Things had gone too far; Muḥammad-Hádí
                        was past saving.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="706180968" class="brl-location"></a>He was a man short of stature, lofty of station and mind. His heart was pure, his
                        soul luminous. During all those days when he served the Holy Threshold, he was loved
                        by the friends and favored by God. From time to time, a smile on His lips, the Blessed
                        Beauty would speak to him, expressing kindness and grace.

                        <a id="924802469" class="brl-location"></a>Muḥammad-Hádí was loyal always, and he accounted all things other than God’s good
                        pleasure as fiction and fable, nothing more. Blessed is he for this gift bestowed
                        upon him, glad tidings to him for the place to which he shall be led; may it do him
                        good, this wine-cup tempered at the camphor fountain, and may all his strivings meet
                        with thanks and be acceptable to God.<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#913627889">1</a></sup>

                        childhood for nobility of soul. He was newly born when his distinguished father passed
                        away, and thus it came about that from the beginning to the end of his days, he spent
                        his life in the sheltering arms of Bahá’u’lláh. He was detached from every selfish
                        thought, averse to every mention except to whatever concerned the Holy Cause. He was
                        reared in Persia under the care of Bahá’u’lláh, and in Iraq as well, especially favored
                        by Him. In the presence of Bahá’u’lláh, it was he who would pass around the tea; and
                        he waited upon his Brother at all times, by day and night. He was always silent. He
                        always held fast to the Covenant of “Am I not your Lord?” He was encompassed by loving-kindness
                        and bounty; day and night he had access to the presence of Bahá’u’lláh; he was invariably
                        patient and forbearing, until in the end he reached the very heights of Divine favor
                        and acceptance.

                        <a id="065957830" class="brl-location"></a>He kept always to his own way of being. He traveled in the company of Bahá’u’lláh;
                        from Iraq to Constantinople he was with the convoy and at the halting-places it was
                        his task to pitch the tents. He served with the greatest diligence, and did not know
                        the meaning of lethargy or fatigue. In Constantinople as well, and later in the Land
                        of Mystery, Adrianople, he continued on, in one and the same invariable condition.

                        <a id="226058300" class="brl-location"></a>With his peerless Lord, he then was exiled to the ‘Akká fortress, condemned by order
                        of the Sulṭán to be imprisoned forever.<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#390565758">2</a></sup> But he accepted in the same spirit all that came his way—comfort and torment, hardship
                        and respite, sickness and health; eloquently, he would return thanks to the Blessed
                        Beauty for His bounties, uttering praise with a free heart and a face that shone like
                        the sun. Each morning and evening he waited upon Bahá’u’lláh, delighting in and sustained
                        by His presence; and mostly, he kept silent.

                        remained firm in the Covenant, shunning the craft, the malice and hypocrisy which
                        then appeared, devoting himself entirely to God, supplicating and praying. To those
                        who would listen he gave wise advice; and he called to mind the days of the Blessed
                        Beauty and grieved over the fact that he himself lived on. After the departure of
                        Bahá’u’lláh, he did not draw an easeful breath; he kept company with no one, but stayed
                        by himself most of the time, alone in his small refuge, burning with the fires of
                        separation. Day by day he grew feebler, more helpless, until at the last he soared
                        away to the world of God. Upon him be peace; upon him be praise and mercy, in the
                        gardens of Heaven. His luminous grave is in Naqíb, by Tiberias.

                        Ustád Aḥmad. These two were brothers, of pure lineage, and natives of Ká<u>sh</u>án. From the time when both became believers each held the other in his embrace. They
                        harkened to the voice of God, and to His cry of “Am I not your Lord?” they replied,

                        God. When the oppressor stretched forth his hands against them, and tormented them
                        beyond endurance, they emigrated to Iraq, to the sheltering care of Bahá’u’lláh. They
                        were two most blessed souls. For some time they remained in Iraq, praying in all lowliness,
                        and supplicating God.

                        taken as a prisoner to Mosul. Ustád Aḥmad went on with the party of Bahá’u’lláh to
                        the Most Great Prison, and Ustád Báqir emigrated from Mosul to ‘Akká. Both of the
                        brothers were under the protection of God and free from every earthly bond. In the
                        prison, they worked at their craft, keeping to themselves, away from friend and stranger
                        alike. Tranquil, dignified, confident, strong in faith, sheltered by the All-Merciful,
                        they happily spent their days. Ustád Báqir was the first to die, and some time afterward
                        his brother followed him.

                        <a id="786670883" class="brl-location"></a>These two were firm believers, loyal, patient, at all times thankful, at all times
                        supplicating God in lowliness, with their faces turned in His direction. During that
                        long stay in the prison they were never neglectful of duty, never at fault. They were
                        constantly joyful, for they had drunk deep of the holy cup; and when they soared upward,
                        out of the world, the friends mourned over them and asked that by the grace of Bahá’u’lláh,
                        they should be favored and forgiven. These two were embosomed in bounty, and Divinely
                        sustained, and the Blessed Beauty was well pleased with them both; with this provision
                        for their journey, they set out for the world to come. Upon them both be the glory

                        Then he found favor in the eyes of the King of Martyrs and became a trusted attendant
                        of the Beloved of Martyrs,<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#578773824">3</a></sup> serving them for some years. He was confirmed in his work, so that on many occasions
                        the King of Martyrs expressed satisfaction with him, saying, “This man is one of those

                        the Threshold. He was patient, forbearing, a true friend and companion. Then the Supreme

                        in the neighborhood of Bahá’u’lláh; and then humbly at the Threshold, with a contrite
                        heart, he abandoned this fleeting life and soared away to the boundless realms beyond.
                        His sweet-scented dust is in Adrianople.

                        <a id="209412135" class="brl-location"></a>As for Ḥájí Faraju’lláh, he lived on in that city, until the day when merciless oppressors
                        banished Bahá’u’lláh to ‘Akká, and in His company the Ḥájí came here to the Most Great
                        Prison. Later on, when hardship was changed into ease, he engaged in trade, becoming
                        a partner to Muḥammad-‘Alí of Iṣfahán. For some time he prospered and was happy. Then
                        he was given leave to go, and journeyed to India, where he spent a long period before
                        he winged his way into the gardens of forgiveness, and entered the precincts of ineffable
                        mercy.

                        <a id="416651120" class="brl-location"></a>This servant of the Blessed Beauty was one with the believers in their afflictions
                        and calamities; he had his share of the anguish. The favors of Bahá’u’lláh compassed
                        him about, and he rejoiced in that boundless grace. He was among the companions, a
                        close associate of the friends, and he had a docile heart. Although his body was thin
                        and sickly, he was thankful, accepted it, was patient, and endured the trials of God’s
                        path. Unto him be greetings and praise; may he receive Heavenly gifts and blessings;
                        upon him be the glory of God the All-Glorious. His pure sepulcher is in Bombay, India.

                        one of four honored brothers: Muḥammad-Ṣádiq; Muḥammad-Ibráhím; Áqá Ḥabíbu’lláh; and
                        Muḥammad-‘Alí. These four lived in Baghdad with their paternal uncle, Áqá Muḥammad-Riḍá,
                        known as ‘Aríḍ. They all lived in the same house, and remained together day and night.
                        Bird-like, they shared the one nest; and they were always fresh and full of grace,
                        like flowers in a bed.

                        <a id="061855242" class="brl-location"></a>When the Ancient Beauty arrived in Iraq their house was in the neighborhood of His,
                        and thus they had the joy of watching Him as He came and went. Little by little the
                        manner of that Lord of hearts, what He did and what He did not do, and the sight of
                        His lovesome face, had its effect; they began to thirst after the Faith and to seek
                        His grace and favor. They presented themselves at the door of His house, as if they
                        were flowers blooming there; and they were soon enamored of the light that shone out
                        from His brow, captives of the beauty of that dear Companion. They needed no teacher,
                        then; by themselves, they saw through the veils that had blinded them before, and
                        won the supreme desire of their hearts.

                        accepted the Faith. They did not hesitate for an instant, for they had amazing receptivity.
                        This is what is meant by the Qur’ánic verse: “…whose oil would well nigh shine out,
                        even though fire touched it not! It is light upon light.”<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#291892277">1</a></sup> That is, this oil is so fully prepared, so ready to be lit, that it almost catches
                        fire of itself, though no flame be at hand; which means that the capacity for faith,
                        and the deserving it, can be so great, that without the communication of a single
                        word the light shines forth. This is how it was with those pure-hearted men; truly
                        they were loyal, staunch, and devoted to God.

                        and from there to Adrianople, where he lived happily for some time, close to his Lord.
                        He was humble, long-suffering, thankful; there was always a smile on his lips; he
                        was light of heart, and his soul was in love with Bahá’u’lláh. Later he was given
                        leave to return to Iraq, for his family was there, and he remained in that city for
                        a while, dreaming and remembering.

                        <a id="344801434" class="brl-location"></a>Then a great calamity occurred in Iraq, and all four brothers with their noble uncle
                        were taken prisoner. Victimized, captive, they were brought to Mosul. The uncle, Áqá
                        Muḥammad-Riḍá, was an old man, illumined of mind, spiritual of heart, a man detached
                        from all worldly things. He had been extremely rich in Iraq, enjoying comforts and
                        pleasures, but now in Hadbá—Mosul—he became the chief victim among the prisoners,
                        and suffered dire need. He was destitute, but remained dignified, patient, content,
                        and thankful. Keeping to himself in an out-of-the-way place, he praised God day and
                        night until he died. He gave up his heart to his heart’s Love, burst from the shackles
                        of this inconstant world and ascended to the Kingdom that endures forever. May God
                        immerse him in the waters of forgiveness, make him to enter the garden of His compassion
                        and good pleasure, and keep him in Paradise till the end of time.

                        <a id="468018965" class="brl-location"></a>As for Muḥammad-Ṣádiq, he too, in Mosul, was subjected to hardships on God’s path.
                        He too was a soul at rest, well-pleased with his Lord and well-pleasing unto Him.
                        In the end he too replied to the voice of the King of Glory: “Lord, here am I!” and
                        came to fulfill the verses: “O thou soul who art well-assured, return unto thy Lord,
                        well-pleased, and well-pleasing unto Him. Enter thou among My servants; enter Thou
                        My Paradise.”<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#403293587">2</a></sup>

                        <a id="369976487" class="brl-location"></a>And Muḥammad-‘Alí, once he was freed from captivity, hastened from Mosul to the Holy
                        Land, to the precincts of inexhaustible grace. Here he still lives. Although he suffers
                        hardship, his heart is at peace. As for his brother Ibráhím, referred to above, he
                        also came on from Mosul to ‘Akká, but to a region close by. There with patience, calm,
                        contentment, but difficulty, he engaged in trade, meanwhile mourning the ascension
                        of Bahá’u’lláh by day and night. Lowly and contrite, with his face turned toward the
                        mysterious realms of God, he wore his life away. At the end, consumed by the years,
                        hardly able to move about, he came to Haifa, where he found a corner of the travelers’
                        hospice to live in, and spent his time humbly calling upon God, entreating Him, offering
                        praise. Little by little, eaten away with age, his person began its dissolution, and
                        at the end he stripped off the garment of flesh and with his unclothed spirit took
                        flight to the realm of the All-Merciful. He was transported out of this dark life
                        into the shining air, and was plunged in a sea of lights. May God brighten his grave
                        with spreading rays, and lull his spirit with the fannings of Divine compassion. Upon
                        him be the mercy of God, and His good pleasure.

                        <a id="521231744" class="brl-location"></a>As for Áqá Ḥabíbu’lláh, he too was made a captive in Iraq and was banished away to
                        Mosul. For a long time, he lived in that city, subjected to hardships, but remaining
                        content, and his faith increasing day by day. When famine came to Mosul life was harder
                        than ever on the outsiders, but in the remembrance of God their hearts were at rest,<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#285047258">3</a></sup> and their souls ate of food from Heaven. Thus they endured it all with astonishing
                        patience, and the people wondered at those strangers in their midst who were neither
                        distressed nor terrified as the others were, and who continued to offer praise day
                        and night. “What amazing trust,” the people said, “they have in God!”

                        <a id="687950464" class="brl-location"></a>Ḥabíb was a man with a great store of patience and a joyous heart. He accustomed himself
                        to exile and he lived in a state of yearning love. After the departure from Baghdad,
                        the prisoners of Mosul were constantly made mention of by Bahá’u’lláh; with regard
                        to them, He expressed His infinite favor. A few years afterward, Ḥabíb hastened away
                        to the encompassing mercy of God, and found a nest and refuge on the boughs of the
                        celestial Tree. There, in the Paradise of all delights, with wondrous songs he poured
                        out his praise of the bountiful Lord.

                        and stranger alike, ever striving to show forth loving-kindness to all. He brought
                        his brothers from Persia to Baghdad, and opened a shop for arts and crafts, applying
                        himself to the welfare of others. He, too, was taken prisoner and exiled from Baghdad

                        was dear to him and set out for the Desired Land.

                        <a id="269480360" class="brl-location"></a>As he traveled along with his two sons, gladdened by hopes of the meeting that would
                        be his, he paused on every hilltop, in every plain, village and hamlet to visit with
                        the friends. But the great distance stretching out before him changed to a sea of
                        troubles, and although his spirit yearned, his body weakened, and at the end he sickened
                        and turned helpless; all this when he was without a home.
                     </p>

                        <a id="693243121" class="brl-location"></a>Sick as he was, he did not renounce the journey, nor fail in his resolve; he had amazing
                        strength of will, and was determined to keep on; but the illness worsened with every
                        passing day, until at last he winged his way to the mercy of God, and yielded up his
                        soul in a longing unfulfilled.
                     </p>

                        <a id="550834169" class="brl-location"></a>Although to outward eyes he never drained the cup of meeting, never gazed upon the
                        beauty of Bahá’u’lláh, still he achieved the very spirit of spiritual communion; he
                        is accounted as one of those who attained the Presence, and for him the reward of
                        those who reached that Presence is fixed and ordained. He was a stainless soul, faithful,
                        devoted and true. He never drew a breath except in righteousness, and his single desire
                        was to worship his Lord. He walked the ways of love; he was known to all for steadfast
                        loyalty and pure intent. May God fill up reunion’s cup for him in a fair country,
                        make him to enter the everlasting Kingdom, and console his eyes with beholding the
                        lights of that mysterious Realm.

                        this excellent man was not of the learned class, he was an expert in the field of
                        Muslim sacred traditions and an eloquent interpreter of orally transmitted texts.
                        Persevering in his devotions, known for holy practices and nightly communings and
                        vigils, his heart was illumined, and he was spiritual of mind and soul. He spent most
                        of his time repeating communes, performing the obligatory prayers, confessing his
                        failings and supplicating the Lord. He was one of those who penetrate mysteries, and
                        was a confidant of the righteous. As a teacher of the Faith he was never at a loss
                        for words, forgetting, as he taught, all restraint, pouring forth one upon another
                        sacred traditions and texts.

                        <a id="266976437" class="brl-location"></a>When news of him spread around the town and he was everywhere charged, by prince and
                        pauper alike, with bearing this new name, he freely declared his adherence and on
                        this account was publicly disgraced. Then the evil ‘ulamás of Yazd rose up, issuing
                        a decree that he must die. Since the mujtahid, Mullá Báqir of Ardikán, refused to
                        confirm the sentence of those dark divines, Mullá Mihdí lived on, but was forced to
                        leave his native home. With his two sons, one the great martyr-to-be, Jináb-i-Varqá,
                        and the other Jináb-i-Ḥusayn, he set out for the country of his Well-Beloved. In every
                        town and village along the way, he ably spread the Faith, adducing clear arguments
                        and proofs, quoting from and interpreting the sacred traditions and evident signs.<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#243708365">1</a></sup> He did not rest for a moment; everywhere he shed abroad the attar of the love of
                        God, and diffused the sweet breathings of holiness. And he inspired the friends, making
                        them eager to teach others in their turn, and to excel in knowledge.

                        <a id="388549135" class="brl-location"></a>He was an eminent soul, with his heart fixed on the beauty of God. From the day he
                        was first created and came into this world, he single-mindedly devoted all his efforts
                        to acquiring grace for the day he should be born into the next.<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#002284323">2</a></sup> His heart was illumined, his mind spiritual, his soul aspiring, his destination Heaven.
                        He was imprisoned along his way; and as he crossed the deserts and climbed and descended
                        the mountain slopes he endured terrible, uncounted hardships. But the light of faith
                        shone from his brow and in his breast the longing was aflame, and thus he joyously,
                        gladly passed over the frontiers until at last he came to Beirut. In that city, ill,
                        restive, his patience gone, he spent some days. His yearning grew, and his agitation
                        was such that weak and sick as he was, he could wait no more.

                        <a id="546728760" class="brl-location"></a>He set out on foot for the house of Bahá’u’lláh. Because he lacked proper shoes for
                        the journey, his feet were bruised and torn; his sickness worsened; he could hardly
                        move, but still he went on; somehow he reached the village of Mazra‘ih and here, close
                        by the Mansion, he died. His heart found his Well-Beloved One, when he could bear
                        the separation no more. Let lovers be warned by his story; let them know how he gambled
                        away his life in his yearning after the Light of the World. May God give him to drink
                        of a brimming cup in the everlasting gardens; in the Supreme Assemblage, may God shed
                        upon his face rays of light. Upon him be the glory of the Lord. His sanctified tomb
                        is in Mazra‘ih, beside ‘Akká.

                        <a id="349760995" class="brl-location"></a>Jináb-i-Mírzá Músá was the true brother of Bahá’u’lláh, and from earliest childhood
                        he was reared in the sheltering embrace of the Most Great Name. He drank in the love
                        of God with his mother’s milk; when yet a suckling, he showed an extraordinary attachment
                        to the Blessed Beauty. At all times he was the object of Divine grace, favor and loving-kindness.
                        After their distinguished father died, Mírzá Músá was brought up by Bahá’u’lláh, growing
                        to maturity in the haven of His care. Day by day, the youth’s servitude and devotion
                        increased. In all things, he lived according to the commandments, and he was entirely
                        severed from any thoughts of this world.
                     </p>

                        <a id="657267214" class="brl-location"></a>Like a bright lamp, he shone out in that Household. He wished neither rank nor office,
                        and had no worldly aims at all. His one supreme desire was to serve Bahá’u’lláh, and
                        for this reason he was never separated from his Brother’s presence. No matter what
                        torments the others inflicted, his loyalty equaled the cruelty of the rest, for he
                        had drunk the wine of unadulterated love.

                        <a id="136164979" class="brl-location"></a>Then the voice was heard, crying out of <u>Sh</u>íráz, and from a single utterance of Bahá’u’lláh’s his heart was filled with light,
                        and from a single gust that blew over the gardens of faith, he caught the fragrance.
                        At once, he began to serve the friends. He had an extraordinary attachment to me,
                        and was at all times concerned for my well-being. In Ṭihrán he occupied himself day
                        and night with propagating the Faith and gradually became well known to everyone;
                        habitually he spent his time in the company of blessed souls.

                        <a id="464409584" class="brl-location"></a>Bahá’u’lláh then left Ṭihrán, journeying to Iraq, and of His brothers the two who
                        were in His company were Áqáy-i-Kalím<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#758285731">1</a></sup> and Mírzá Muḥammad-Qulí. They turned their faces away from Persia and the Persians,
                        and closed their eyes to comfort and peace; in the Beloved’s path they chose with
                        all their hearts to bear whatever calamity should be their lot.
                     </p>

                        <a id="439653261" class="brl-location"></a>Thus they arrived in Iraq. During the days when Bahá’u’lláh had vanished from sight,
                        that is, when He was on the journey to Kurdistán, Áqáy-i-Kalím lived on the edge of
                        an abyss; his life was constantly in danger, and each day that passed was worse than
                        the one before; still, he bore it all, and knew no fear. When at last the Blessed
                        Beauty returned out of Kurdistán, Áqáy-i-Kalím resumed his post by the Holy Threshold,
                        rendering every service within his power. For this he became known far and wide. At
                        the time when Bahá’u’lláh left Baghdad for Constantinople, Áqáy-i-Kalím was with Him
                        and continued to serve along the way, as he did on the further journey from Constantinople
                        to Adrianople.
                     </p>

                        It was during the sojourn in this latter city that he detected from Mírzá Yaḥyá the
                        odor of rebellion. Day and night he tried to make him mend his ways, but all to no
                        avail. On the contrary, it was astonishing how, like a deadly poison, the temptings
                        and satanic suggestions of Siyyid Muḥammad worked on Mírzá Yaḥyá, so that Áqáy-i-Kalím
                        finally abandoned hope. Even then he never ceased trying, thinking that somehow, perhaps,
                        he could still the tempest and rescue Mírzá Yaḥyá from the gulf. His heart was worn
                        away with despair and grief. He tried everything he knew. At last he had to admit
                        the truth of these words of Saná’í:
                        <span class="brl-linegroup brl-global-verse brl-italic brl-topmargin brl-btmmargin">

                           <span class="brl-linegroupline">To him who is not wise—</span>

                        <a id="553000601" class="brl-location"></a>When all hope was gone, he ended the relationship, saying: “O my brother, if others
                        are in doubt as to this affair, you and I both know the truth. Have you forgotten
                        the loving-kindness of Bahá’u’lláh, and how He trained us both? What care He took
                        with your lessons and your penmanship; how constantly He saw to your spelling and
                        your composition, and encouraged you to practice the different calligraphic styles;
                        He even guided your copy with His own blessed fingers. Who does not know how He showered
                        favors on you, how He brought you up in the haven of His embrace. Is this your thanks
                        for all His tenderness—that you plot with Siyyid Muḥammad and desert the shelter of
                        Bahá’u’lláh? Is this your loyalty? Is this the right return for all His love?” The
                        words had no effect whatever; on the contrary, with each passing day, Mírzá Yaḥyá
                        disclosed a greater measure of his concealed intent. Then at the end, the final rupture
                        took place.

                        to perpetual banishment.<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#299842393">2</a></sup> He devoted all his time in the Most Great Prison to serving Bahá’u’lláh, and had

                        the believers; until at last he left this world of dust and hastened to the holy world

                        Siyyid Javád on that occasion made a plea in the Íl<u>kh</u>ání’s behalf, saying: “This Íl<u>kh</u>ání, ‘Alí-Qulí <u>Kh</u>án, although a sinner and a lifelong creature of his passions, has now repented. He

                        sins, and I will take steps to bring him comfort and peace of mind.”

                        <a id="336281974" class="brl-location"></a>The Íl<u>kh</u>ání had been a man of unlimited wealth, but he had wasted it all on the desires of
                        the flesh. He was now destitute, to such a point that he did not even dare to step
                        outside his house, because of the creditors waiting there to fall upon him. Bahá’u’lláh
                        directed him to go to ‘Umar Pá<u>sh</u>á, the Governor of Damascus, and obtain from him a letter of recommendation to Constantinople.
                        The Íl<u>kh</u>ání complied, and he received every assistance from the Governor of Baghdad. After
                        utter despair, he began to hope again, and left for Constantinople. When he arrived
                        at Díyárbakr<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#834954089">3</a></sup> he penned a letter on behalf of two Armenian merchants. “These two are about to leave
                        for Baghdad,” his letter said. “They have shown me every courtesy, and have also asked
                        me for an introduction. I had no refuge or shelter except Your bounty; thus I beg
                        of You to show them favor.” The superscription, that is, the address he had written
                        on the envelope was: “To His Eminence Bahá’u’lláh, Leader of the Bábís.” The merchants
                        presented this letter to Bahá’u’lláh at the head of the bridge, and when He inquired
                        about it their reply was: “In Díyárbakr, the Íl<u>kh</u>ání gave us particulars as to this Cause.” Then they accompanied Him to His house.

                        <a id="011450878" class="brl-location"></a>When the Blessed Beauty entered the family apartments, Áqáy-i-Kalím was there to meet
                        Him. Bahá’u’lláh cried out, “Kalím, Kalím! The fame of the Cause of God has reached
                        as far as Díyárbakr!” And He was smiling, jubilant.

                        <a id="734441113" class="brl-location"></a>Another of those who left their homes and came to settle in the neighborhood of Bahá’u’lláh
                        was Ḥájí Muḥammad <u>Kh</u>án. This distinguished man, a native of Sístán, was a Balú<u>ch</u>. When he was very young, he caught fire and became a mystic—an ‘áríf, or adept. As
                        a wandering dervish, completely selfless, he went out from his home and, following
                        the dervish rule, traveled about in search of his mur<u>sh</u>id, his perfect leader. For he yearned, as the Qalandar dervishes would say, to discover
                        that “priest of the Magi,” or spiritual guide.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="862905959" class="brl-location"></a>Far and wide, he carried on his search. He would speak to everyone he met. But what
                        he longed for was the sweet scent of the love of God, and this he was unable to detect
                        in anyone, whether Gnostic or philosopher, or member of the <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u>í sect. All he could see in the dervishes was their tufted beards, and their palms-up
                        religion of beggary. They were “dervish”—poor in all save God—in name only; all they
                        cared about, it seemed to him, was whatever came to hand. Nor did he find illumination
                        among the Illuminati; he heard nothing from them but idle argument. He observed that
                        their grandiloquence was not eloquence and that their subtleties were but windy figures
                        of speech. Truth was not there; the core of inner meaning was absent. For true philosophy
                        is that which produces rewards of excellence, and among these learned men there was
                        no such fruit to be found; at the peak of their accomplishment, they became the slaves
                        of vice, led an unconcerned life and were given over to personal characteristics that
                        were deserving of blame. To him, of all that constitutes the high, distinguishing
                        quality of humankind, they were devoid.
                     </p>

                        <a id="640246684" class="brl-location"></a>As for the <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u>í group, their essence was gone, only the dregs remained; the kernel of them had vanished,
                        leaving the shell behind; most of their dialectics was lumber and superfluities by
                        now.

                        <a id="277498407" class="brl-location"></a>Thus at the very moment when he heard the call from the Kingdom of God, he shouted,
                        “Yea, verily!” and he was off like the desert wind. He traveled over vast distances,
                        arrived at the Most Great Prison and attained the presence of Bahá’u’lláh. When his
                        eyes fell upon that bright Countenance he was instantly enslaved. He returned to Persia
                        so that he could meet with those people who professed to be following the Path, those
                        friends of other days who were seeking out the Truth, and deal with them as his loyalty
                        and duty required.
                     </p>

                        <a id="886708292" class="brl-location"></a>Both going and returning, the Ḥájí betook himself to each one of his friends, foregathered
                        with them, and let each one hear the new song from Heaven. He reached his homeland
                        and set his family’s affairs in order, providing for all, seeing to the security,
                        happiness and comfort of each one. After that he bade them all goodby. To his relatives,
                        his wife, children, kin, he said: “Do not look for me again; do not wait for my return.”
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="013990630" class="brl-location"></a>He took up a staff and wandered away; over the mountains he went, across the plains,
                        seeking and finding the mystics, his friends. On his first journey, he went to the
                        late Mírzá Yúsuf <u>Kh</u>án (Mustawfíyu’l-Mamálik), in Ṭihrán. When he had said his say, Yúsuf <u>Kh</u>án expressed a wish, and declared that should it be fulfilled, he would believe; the
                        wish was to be given a son. Should such a bounty become his, Yúsuf <u>Kh</u>án would be won over. The Ḥájí reported this to Bahá’u’lláh, and received a firm promise
                        in reply. Accordingly, when the Ḥájí met with Yúsuf <u>Kh</u>án on his second journey, he found him with a child in his arms. “Mírzá,” the Ḥájí
                        cried, “praise be to God! Your test has demonstrated the Truth. You snared your bird
                        of joy.” “Yes,” answered Yúsuf <u>Kh</u>án, “the proof is clear. I am convinced. This year, when you go to Bahá’u’lláh, say
                        that I implore His grace and favor for this child, so that it may be kept safe in
                        the sheltering care of God.”
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="792330385" class="brl-location"></a>Ḥájí Muḥammad then went to the blissful future martyr, the King of Martyrs, and asked
                        him to intercede, so that he, the Ḥájí, might be allowed to keep watch at the doorway
                        of Bahá’u’lláh. The King of Martyrs sent in this request by letter, after which Ḥájí
                        <u>Kh</u>án duly arrived at the Most Great Prison and made his home in the neighborhood of
                        his loving Friend. He enjoyed this honor for a long time, and later, in the Mazra‘ih
                        garden as well, he was very frequently in Bahá’u’lláh’s presence. After the Beloved
                        had ascended, Ḥájí <u>Kh</u>án remained faithful to the Covenant and Testament, shunning the hypocrites. At last,
                        when this servant was absent on the journeys to Europe and America, the Ḥájí made
                        his way to the travelers’ hospice at the Ḥaẓíratu’l-Quds; and here, beside the Shrine
                        of the Báb, he took his flight to the world above.

                        and praise. His bright tomb is in Haifa.

                        filled with the red wine of faith. At the time when he was first made captive by the
                        tender Loved One, he was in the flower of his youth. Then he fell a prey to the oppressors,
                        and following the upheaval in Nayríz and all the suffering, his persecutors laid hold
                        of him. Three farrá<u>sh</u>es pinned his arms and tied his hands behind him; but the Amír by main strength burst
                        his bonds, snatched a dagger from a farrá<u>sh</u>’s belt, saved himself and ran away to Iraq. There he engaged in writing down the
                        sacred verses and later won the honor of serving at the Holy Threshold. Constant and
                        steadfast, he remained on duty day and night. During the journey from Baghdad to Constantinople,
                        from there to Adrianople, and from there to the Most Great Prison, he was always at
                        hand to serve. He married the handmaid of God, Ḥabíbih, who also served at the Threshold,
                        and his daughter Badí‘ih became the helpmeet of the late Ḥusayn-Áqá Qahvih-<u>ch</u>í.

                        behind him and hastened away to the unsullied world above. May God illumine the place
                        where he rests with rays from the all-highest Realm. Unto him be salutations and praise.

                        and had become skilled in composing both prose and verse, as well as in producing
                        calligraphy in the style known as <u>sh</u>ikastih.<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#929921788">1</a></sup> He was singled out from his fellows, head and shoulders above the rest. When still
                        a child, he learned of the Lord’s Advent, caught fire with love, and became one of
                        those who “gave their all to purchase Joseph.” He was chief of the yearning seekers,
                        lord of lovers; eloquently, he began to teach the Faith, and to prove the validity
                        of the Manifestation.

                        <a id="412328997" class="brl-location"></a>He made converts; and because he yearned after God, he became a laughingstock in Ká<u>sh</u>án, disparaged by friend and stranger alike, exposed to the taunts of his faithless
                        companions. One of them said: “He has lost his mind.” And another: “He is a public
                        disgrace. Fortune has turned against him. He is done for.” The bullies mocked him,
                        and spared him nothing. When life became untenable, and open war broke out, he left
                        his homeland and journeyed to Iraq, the focal center of the new Light, where he gained
                        the presence of all mankind’s Beloved.

                        <a id="939986746" class="brl-location"></a>He spent some time here, in the friends’ company, composing verses that sang the praises
                        of Bahá’u’lláh. Later he was given leave to return home, and went back to live for
                        a while in Ká<u>sh</u>án. But again, he was plagued by yearning love, and could bear the separation no more.
                        He returned, therefore, to Baghdad, bringing with him his respected sister, the third
                        consort.<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#716297689">2</a></sup>

                        left Iraq for Constantinople, at which time Mírzá Mihdí was directed to remain behind
                        and guard the Holy House. Restless, consumed with longing, he stayed on. When the
                        friends were banished from Baghdad to Mosul, he was among the prisoners, a victim
                        along with the others. With the greatest hardship, he got to Mosul, and here fresh
                        calamities awaited him; he was ill almost all the time, he was an outcast, and destitute.
                        Still he endured it for a considerable period, was patient, retained his dignity,
                        and continually offered thanks. Finally he could bear the absence of Bahá’u’lláh no
                        longer. He sought permission, was granted leave to come, and set out for the Most
                        Great Prison.

                        <a id="905646536" class="brl-location"></a>Because the way was long and hard, and he suffered cruelly on the journey, when he
                        finally reached the ‘Akká prison he was almost helpless, and worn to the bone. It
                        was during the time when the Blessed Beauty was imprisoned within the citadel, at
                        the center of the barracks. Despite the terrible hardships, Mírzá Mihdí spent some
                        days here, in great joy. To him, the calamities were favors, the tribulations were
                        Divine Providence, the chastisement abounding grace; for he was enduring all this
                        on the pathway of God, and seeking to win His good pleasure. His illness worsened;
                        from day to day he failed; then at the last, under sheltering grace, he took his flight
                        to the inexhaustible mercy of the Lord.
                     </p>

                        <a id="197465871" class="brl-location"></a>This noble personage had been honored among men, but for God’s love he lost both name
                        and fame. He bore manifold misfortunes with never a complaint. He was content with
                        God’s decrees, and walked the ways of resignation. The glance of Bahá’u’lláh’s favor
                        was upon him; he was close to the Divine Threshold. Thus, from the beginning of his
                        life till the end, he remained in one and the same inner state: immersed in an ocean
                        of submission and consent. “O my Lord, take me, take me!” he would cry, until at last
                        he soared away to the world that no man sees.

He was among the most
                        noted of mystics, and had a witty and subtle mind. The fame of this spiritual wayfarer
                        reached out to every land. He was the leading calligrapher of Persia and well known
                        to all the great; he enjoyed a special position among the court ministers of Ṭihrán,
                        and with them he was solidly established.<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#167252922">3</a></sup> He was famed throughout Asia Minor; his pen was the wonder of all calligraphers,
                        for he was adept at every calligraphic style. He was besides, for human virtues, a
                        bright star.

                        This highly accomplished man first heard of the Cause of God in Iṣfahán, and the result
                        was that he set out to find Bahá’u’lláh. He crossed the great distances, measured
                        out the miles, climbing mountains, passing over deserts and over the sea, until at
                        last he came to Adrianople. Here he reached the heights of faith and assurance; here
                        he drank the wine of certitude. He responded to the summons of God, he attained the
                        presence of Bahá’u’lláh, he ascended to that apogee where he was received and accepted.
                        By now he was reeling to and fro like a drunkard in his love for God, and because
                        of his violent desire and yearning, his mind seemed to wander. He would be raised
                        up, and then cast down again; he was as one distracted. He spent some time under the
                        sheltering grace of Bahá’u’lláh, and every day new blessings were showered upon him.
                        Meanwhile he produced his splendid calligraphs; he would write out the Most Great
                        Name, Yá Bahá’u’l-Abhá, O Thou Glory of the All-Glorious, with marvelous skill, in
                        many different forms, and would send them everywhere.<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#453701927">4</a></sup>

                        <a id="652880691" class="brl-location"></a>He was then directed to go on a journey to Constantinople, and set out with Jináb-i-Sayyáḥ.
                        When he reached that Great City, the leading Persians and Turks received him with
                        every honor at first, and they were captivated by his jet black, calligraphic art.
                        He, however, began boldly and eloquently to teach the Faith. The Persian ambassador
                        lurked in ambush; betaking himself to the Sulṭán’s vazírs he slandered Mi<u>sh</u>kín-Qalam. “This man is an agitator,” the ambassador told them, “sent here by Bahá’u’lláh
                        to stir up trouble and make mischief in this Great City. He has already won over a
                        large company, and he intends to subdue still more. These Bahá’ís turned Persia upside
                        down; now they have started in on the capital of Turkey. The Persian Government put
                        20,000 of them to the sword, hoping by this tactic to quench the fires of sedition.
                        You should awaken to the danger; soon this perverse thing will blaze up here as well.
                        It will consume the harvest of your life; it will burn up the whole world. Then you
                        can do nothing, for it will be too late.”

                        <a id="416094121" class="brl-location"></a>Actually that mild and submissive man, in that throne city of Asia Minor, was occupied
                        solely with his calligraphy and his worship of God. He was striving to bring about
                        not sedition but fellowship and peace. He was seeking to reconcile the followers of
                        different faiths, not to drive them still further apart. He was of service to strangers
                        and was helping to educate the native people. He was a refuge to the hapless and a
                        horn of plenty to the poor. He invited all comers to the oneness of humankind; he
                        shunned hostility and malice.

                        <a id="333142732" class="brl-location"></a>The Persian ambassador, however, wielded enormous power, and he had maintained close
                        ties with the ministers for a very long time. He prevailed on a number of persons
                        to insinuate themselves into various gatherings and there to make every kind of false
                        charge against the believers. Urged on by the oppressors, spies began to surround
                        Mi<u>sh</u>kín-Qalam. Then, as instructed by the ambassador, they carried reports to the Prime
                        Minister, stating that the individual in question was stirring up mischief day and
                        night, that he was a troublemaker, a rebel and a criminal. The result was, they jailed
                        him and they sent him away to Gallipoli, where he joined our own company of victims.
                        They despatched him to Cyprus and ourselves to the ‘Akká prison. On the island of
                        Cyprus, Jináb-i-Mi<u>sh</u>kín was held prisoner in the citadel at Famagusta, and in this city he remained, a
                        captive, from the year 85 till 94.

                        <a id="670063289" class="brl-location"></a>When Cyprus passed out of Turkish hands, Mi<u>sh</u>kín-Qalam was freed and betook himself to his Well-Beloved in the city of ‘Akká, and
                        here he lived encompassed by the grace of Bahá’u’lláh, producing his marvelous calligraphs
                        and sending them about. He was at all times joyous of spirit, ashine with the love
                        of God, like a candle burning its life away, and he was a consolation to all the believers.
                     </p>

                        <a id="597775506" class="brl-location"></a>After the ascension of Bahá’u’lláh, Mi<u>sh</u>kín-Qalam remained loyal, solidly established in the Covenant. He stood before the
                        violators like a brandished sword. He would never go half way with them; he feared
                        no one but God; not for a moment did he falter, nor ever fail in service.
                     </p>

                        <a id="445456153" class="brl-location"></a>Following the ascension he made a journey to India, where he associated with the lovers
                        of truth. He spent some time there, making fresh efforts every day. When I learned
                        that he was getting helpless, I sent for him at once and he came back to this Most
                        Great Prison, to the joy of the believers, who felt blessed to have him here again.
                        He was at all times my close companion. He had amazing verve, intense love. He was
                        a compendium of perfections: believing, confident, serene, detached from the world,
                        a peerless companion, a wit—and his character like a garden in full bloom. For the
                        love of God, he left all good things behind; he closed his eyes to success, he wanted
                        neither comfort nor rest, he sought no wealth, he wished only to be free from the
                        defilement of the world. He had no ties to this life, but spent his days and nights
                        supplicating and communing with God. He was always smiling, effervescing; he was spirit
                        personified, love embodied. For sincerity and loyalty he had no match, nor for patience
                        and inner calm. He was selflessness itself, living on the breaths of the spirit.
                     </p>

                        <a id="931773270" class="brl-location"></a>If he had not been in love with the Blessed Beauty, if he had not set his heart on
                        the Realm of Glory, every worldly pleasure could have been his. Wherever he went,
                        his many calligraphic styles were a substantial capital, and his great accomplishment
                        brought him attention and respect from rich and poor alike. But he was hopelessly
                        enamored of man’s one true Love, and thus he was free of all those other bonds, and
                        could float and soar in the spirit’s endless sky.
                     </p>

                        <a id="678355703" class="brl-location"></a>Finally, when I was absent, he left this darksome, narrow world and hastened away
                        to the land of lights. There, in the haven of God’s boundless mercy, he found infinite
                        rewards. Unto him be praise and salutations, and the Supreme Companion’s tender grace.

                        trusted confidant, he loosed his tongue to proclaim the Faith. He informed himself
                        as to its proofs, and went deep into its Scriptures. He was also a gifted poet, writing
                        odes in eulogy of Bahá’u’lláh.

                        the presence of Bahá’u’lláh, and received abundant grace. The Blessed Beauty showered
                        favors upon Ustád ‘Alí, who entered His presence almost every day. He was one of those
                        who were exiled from Baghdad to Mosul, and he endured severe hardships there. He remained
                        a long time in Mosul, in extremely straitened circumstances but resigned to the will
                        of God, always in prayer and supplication, and with a thankful tongue.

                        <a id="370413164" class="brl-location"></a>Finally he came from Mosul to the Holy Shrine and here by the tomb of Bahá’u’lláh
                        he would meditate and pray. In the dark of the night, restless and uneasy, he would
                        lament and cry out; when he was supplicating God his heart burned within him; his
                        eyes would shed their tears, and he would lift up his voice and chant. He was completely
                        cut off from this dust heap, this mortal world. He shunned it, he asked but one thing—to
                        soar away; and he hoped for the promised recompense to come. He could not bear for
                        the Light of the World to have disappeared, and what he sought was the paradise of
                        reunion with Him, and what his eyes hungered to behold was the glory of the Abhá Realm.
                        At last his prayer was answered and he rose upward into the world of God, to the gathering-place
                        of the splendors of the Lord of Lords.

                        in Mázgán, he was suckled at the breast of grace. He was a child of the eminent scholar,
                        <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u>-i-Mázgání; his noble father was one of the leading citizens of Qamṣar, near Ká<u>sh</u>án, and for piety, holiness, and the fear of God he had no peer. This father embodied
                        all the qualities that are worthy of praise; moreover his ways were pleasing, his
                        disposition good, he was an excellent companion, and for all these things he was well
                        known. When he threw off restraint and openly declared himself a believer, the faithless,
                        whether friend or stranger, turned their backs on him and began to plot his death.
                        But he continued to further the Cause, to alert the people’s hearts, and to welcome
                        the newcomers as generously as ever. Thus in Ká<u>sh</u>án the fame of his strong faith reached as high as the Milky Way. Then the pitiless
                        aggressors rose up, plundered his possessions and killed him.

                        live in that place no longer. Had he remained, he too, like his father, would have
                        been put to the sword. He passed some time in Iraq, and received the honor of being
                        in the presence of Bahá’u’lláh. Then he went back to Persia, but again he longed to
                        look upon Bahá’u’lláh, and with his wife he set out over the deserts and mountains,
                        sometimes riding, sometimes on foot, measuring off the miles, passing from one shore
                        to the other, reaching the Holy Place at last and in the shade of the Divine Lote-Tree
                        finding safety and peace.

                        When the beauty of the Desired One had vanished from this world, ‘Alí-Akbar remained
                        loyal to the Covenant and prospered under the grace of God. By disposition and because
                        of the intense love in his heart, he yearned to write poetry, to fashion odes and
                        <u>gh</u>azals, but he lacked both meter and rhyme:
                        <span class="brl-linegroup brl-global-verse brl-italic brl-topmargin brl-btmmargin">
                           <span class="brl-linegroupline">I planned a poem, but my Beloved told me,</span>

                           </span>
                        With rapturous longing, his heart desired the realms of his compassionate Lord; consumed
                        by burning love, he left this world at last, and pitched his tent in the world above.
                        May God send down upon his grave, from the Kingdom of His forgiveness, a heavy rain<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#438381651">1</a></sup> of blessings, bestow a great victory upon him, and grant him mercies, pressed down

                        <a id="570875522" class="brl-location"></a>This youth of God was from Iṣfahán, and from an early age was known to its leading
                        divines for his excellent mind. He was of gentle birth, his family was known and respected,
                        and he was an accomplished scholar. He had profited from philosophy and history alike,
                        from sciences and arts, but he thirsted after the secret of reality, and longed for
                        knowledge of God. His feverish thirst was not allayed by the arts and sciences, however
                        limpid those waters. He kept on seeking, seeking, carrying on debates in gatherings
                        of learned men until at last he discovered the meaning of his longing dream, and the
                        enigma, the inviolable secret, lay open before him. Suddenly he caught the scent of
                        fresh flowers from the gardens of the splendor of God, and his heart was ashine with
                        a ray from the Sun of Truth. Whereas before, he was like a fish taken from the water,
                        now he had come to the wellspring of eternal life; before, he was a questing moth;
                        now he had found the candle flame. A true seeker after truth, he was instantly revived
                        by the supreme Glad Tidings; his heart’s eye was brightened by the new dawn of guidance.
                        So blinding was the fire of Divine love that he turned his face away from his life,
                        its peace, its blessings, and set out for the Most Great Prison.
                     </p>

                        <a id="186565441" class="brl-location"></a>In Iṣfahán he had enjoyed every comfort, and the world was good to him. Now his yearning
                        for Bahá’u’lláh freed him from all other bonds. He passed over the long miles, suffered
                        intense hardships, exchanged a palace for a prison, and in the ‘Akká fortress assisted
                        the believers and attended upon and served Bahá’u’lláh. He who had been waited upon,
                        now waited on others; he who had been the master was now the servant, he who had once
                        been a leader was now a captive. He had no rest, no leisure, day or night. To the
                        travelers he was a trusted refuge; to the settlers, a companion without peer. He served
                        beyond his strength, for he was filled with love of the friends. The travelers were
                        devoted to him, and the settlers grateful. And because he was continuously busy, he
                        kept silent at all times.

                        <a id="445170671" class="brl-location"></a>Then the Supreme Affliction came upon us and the absence of Bahá’u’lláh was not to
                        be endured. Mírzá Muḥammad could not stay quiet, day or night. He wasted away, like
                        a candle burning down; from the fiery anguish, his liver and heart were inflamed,
                        and his body could bear no more. He wept and supplicated day and night, yearning to
                        soar away to that undiscovered country. “Lord, free me, free me from this absence,”
                        he would cry, “let me drink of reunion’s cup, find me a lodging in the shelter of
                        Thy mercy, Lord of Lords!”

                        <a id="455355819" class="brl-location"></a>At last he quit this dust heap, the earth, and took his flight to the world that has
                        no end. May it do him good, that cup brimming with the grace of God, may he eat with
                        healthy relish of that food which gives life to heart and soul. May God lead him to
                        that happy journey’s end and grant him an abundant share in the gifts which shall

                        This righteous soul was among those who became believers in Baghdad. It was there
                        he drank from the cup of resignation to the will of God and sought his rest in the
                        shade of the celestial Tree. He was a man high-minded and worthy of trust. He was
                        also an extremely capable and energetic administrator of important affairs, famous
                        in Iraq for his wise counsel. After he became a believer, he was distinguished by
                        the title of Vakíl—deputy. It happened in this way:
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="974286545" class="brl-location"></a>There was a notable in Baghdad by the name of Ḥájí Mírzá Hádí, the jeweler. He had
                        a distinguished son, Áqá Mírzá Músá, who had received from Bahá’u’lláh the title “Letter
                        of Eternity.” This son had become a staunch believer. As for his father, the Ḥájí,
                        he was a princely individual known for his lavish openhandedness not only in Persia
                        and Iraq but as far away as India. To begin with he had been a Persian vazír; but
                        when he saw how the late Fatḥ-‘Alí <u>Sh</u>áh eyed worldly riches, particularly the worldly riches of Persian vazírs, and how
                        he snatched whatever they had accumulated, and how, not content with confiscating
                        their costly vanities and lumber, he punished and tortured them right and left, calling
                        it a legal penalty—the Ḥájí dreaded that he too might be catapulted into the abyss.
                        He abandoned his position as vazír, and his mansion, and fled to Baghdad. Fatḥ-‘Alí
                        <u>Sh</u>áh demanded that the Governor of Baghdad, Dávúd Pá<u>sh</u>á, send him back, but the Pá<u>sh</u>á was a man of courage and the Ḥájí was widely known for his able mind. Accordingly,
                        the Pá<u>sh</u>á respected and helped him and the Ḥájí set up in business as a jeweler. He lived
                        with pomp and splendor, like a great prince. He was one of the most remarkable men
                        of his time, for within his palace he carried on a life of gratification and opulence,
                        but he left his pomp, style and retinue behind, occupied himself with his business
                        affairs and realized great profits.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="725133581" class="brl-location"></a>The door of his house was always open. Turks and Persians, neighbors, strangers from
                        far places, all were his honored guests. Most of Persia’s great, when they came on
                        pilgrimage to the Holy Shrines, would stop at his house, where they would find a banquet
                        laid out, and every luxury ready to hand. The Ḥájí was, indeed, more distinguished
                        than Persia’s Grand Vazír; he outshone all the vazírs for magnificence, and as the
                        days passed by he dispensed ever more largesse to all who came and went. He was the
                        pride of the Persians throughout Iraq, the glory of his fellow nationals. Even on
                        the Turkish vazírs and ministers and the grandees of Baghdad he bestowed gifts and
                        favors; and for intelligence and perceptivity he had no equal.
                     </p>

                        <a id="416917685" class="brl-location"></a>Because of the Ḥájí’s advancing years, toward the end of his days his business affairs
                        declined. Still, he made no change in his way of life. Exactly as before, he continued
                        to live with elegance. The prominent would borrow heavily from him, and never pay
                        him back. One of them, the mother of Áqá <u>Kh</u>án Maḥallátí, borrowed 100,000 túmáns<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#122062504">1</a></sup> from him and did not repay one penny, for she died soon after. The Íl-<u>Kh</u>án, ‘Alí-Qulí <u>Kh</u>án, was another debtor; another was Sayfu’d-Dawlih, a son of Fatḥ-‘Alí <u>Sh</u>áh; another, Válíyyih, a daughter of Fatḥ-‘Alí <u>Sh</u>áh; these are only a few examples out of many, from among the Turkish amírs and the
                        great of Persia and Iraq. All these debts remained unpaid and irrecoverable. Nevertheless,
                        that eminent and princely man continued to live exactly as before.
                     </p>

                        <a id="317477689" class="brl-location"></a>Toward the close of his life he conceived a remarkable love for Bahá’u’lláh, and most
                        humbly, would enter His presence. I remember him saying one day, to the Blessed Beauty,
                        that in the year 1250 and something over, Mírzá Mawkab, the famed astrologer, visited
                        the Shrines. “One day he said to me,” the Ḥájí continued, “‘Mírzá, I see a strange,
                        a unique conjunction in the stars. It has never occurred before. It proves that a
                        momentous event is about to take place, and I am certain that this event can be nothing
                        less than the Advent of the promised Qá’im.’”
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="045012866" class="brl-location"></a>Such was the situation of that illustrious prince when he passed away, leaving as
                        heirs a son and two daughters. Thinking him to be as wealthy as ever, the people believed
                        that his heirs would inherit millions, for everyone knew his way of life. The Persian
                        diplomatic representative, the latter-day mujtahids, and the faithless judge all sharpened
                        their teeth. They started a quarrel among the heirs, so that in the resulting turmoil
                        they themselves would make substantial gains. With this in view they did whatever
                        they could to ruin the heirs, the idea being to strip the inheritors bare, while the
                        Persian diplomat, the mujtahids, and the judge would accumulate the spoils.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="148524494" class="brl-location"></a>Mírzá Músá was a staunch believer; his sisters, however, were from a different mother,
                        and they knew nothing of the Cause. One day the two sisters, accompanied by the son-in-law
                        of the late Mírzá Siyyid Riḍá, came to the house of Bahá’u’lláh. The two sisters entered
                        the family apartments while the son-in-law settled down in the public reception rooms.
                        The two girls then said to Bahá’u’lláh: “The Persian envoy, the judge, and the faithless
                        mujtahids have destroyed us. Toward the close of his life, the late Ḥájí trusted no
                        one but Yourself. We ourselves have been remiss and we should have sought Your protection
                        before; in any case we come now to implore Your pardon and help. Our hope is that
                        You will not send us away despairing, and that through Your favor and support we shall
                        be saved. Deign, then, to look into this affair, and to overlook our past mistakes.”
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="885623377" class="brl-location"></a>Replying, the Blessed Beauty declared with finality that intervention in affairs of
                        this kind was abhorrent to Him. They kept on pleading with Him, however. They remained
                        a whole week in the family apartments, clamoring every morning and evening for favor
                        and grace. “We will not lift our heads from off this Threshold,” they said. “We will
                        seek sanctuary here in this house; we will remain here, by the door of Him Who guards
                        the angels, until He shall deign to look into our concerns and to save us from our
                        oppressors.”
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="506742314" class="brl-location"></a>Each day, Bahá’u’lláh would counsel them, saying, “Matters of this kind are in the
                        hands of the mujtahids and the government authorities. We do not interfere in such
                        affairs.” But they kept on with their importunities, insisting, imploring, begging
                        for help. It happened that the house of Bahá’u’lláh was bare of worldly goods, and
                        these ladies, accustomed to the best of everything, could hardly be satisfied with
                        bread and water. Food had to be procured for them on credit. Briefly, from every direction,
                        there were problems.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="656451524" class="brl-location"></a>Finally one day Bahá’u’lláh summoned me to His presence. “These esteemed ladies,”
                        He said, “with all their exactions, have put Us to considerable inconvenience. There
                        is no help for it—you will have to see to this case. But you must solve this entire,
                        complicated matter in a single day.”
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="935328155" class="brl-location"></a>The next morning, accompanied by Áqáy-i-Kalím, I went to the house of the late Ḥájí.
                        We called in appraisers and they collected all the jewels in an upper apartment; the
                        ledgers and account books having to do with the properties were placed in a second
                        room; the costly furnishings and art objects of the house in a third. A number of
                        jewelers then went to work and set a value on the gems. Other experts appraised the
                        house, the shops, the gardens, the baths. As soon as they began their work I came
                        out and posted someone in each room so that the appraisers could duly complete their
                        tasks. By this time it was nearly noon. We then had luncheon, after which the appraisers
                        were directed to divide everything into two equal parts, so that lots could be cast;
                        one part would be that of the daughters, and one that of the son, Mírzá Músá.<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#897923703">2</a></sup> I then went to bed, for I was ill. In the afternoon I rose, had tea, and repaired
                        to the family apartments of the mansion. Here I observed that the goods had been divided
                        into three parts. I said to them: “My instructions were that everything should be
                        divided into two parts. How is it that there are three?” The heirs and other relatives
                        answered as one: “A third must certainly be set aside. That is why we have divided
                        everything into three. One share is for Mírzá Músá, one for the two daughters, and
                        the third we place at Your disposal; this third is the portion of the deceased and
                        You are to expend it in any way You see fit.”
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="188432369" class="brl-location"></a>Greatly disturbed, we told them, “Such a thing is out of the question. This you must
                        not require, for it cannot be complied with. We gave our word to Bahá’u’lláh that
                        not so much as a copper coin would be accepted.” But they, too, swore upon oath that
                        it must be as they wished, that they would agree to nothing else. This servant answered:
                        “Let us leave this matter for the present. Is there any further disagreement among
                        you?” “Yes,” said Mírzá Músá, “what has become of the money that was left?” Asked
                        the amount, he answered: “Three hundred thousand túmáns.” The daughters said: “There
                        are two possibilities: either this money is here in the house, in some coffer, or
                        buried hereabouts—or else it is in other hands. We will give over the house and all
                        its contents to Mírzá Músá. We two will leave the house, with nothing but our veils.
                        If anything turns up we, as of now, freely accord it to him. If the money is elsewhere,
                        it has no doubt been deposited in someone’s care; and that person, well aware of the
                        breach of trust, will hardly come forward, deal honorably by us, and return it—rather,
                        he will make off with it all. Mírzá Músá must establish a satisfactory proof of what
                        he says; his claim alone is not evidence.” Mírzá Músá replied: “All the property was
                        in their hands; I knew nothing of what was going on—I had no hint of it. They did
                        whatever they pleased.”
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="160566666" class="brl-location"></a>In short, Mírzá Músá had no clear proof of his claim. He could only ask, “Is such
                        a thing possible, that the late Ḥájí had no ready funds?” Since the claim was unsupported,
                        I felt that pursuing it further would lead to a scandal and produce nothing of value.
                        Accordingly I bade them: “Cast the lots.” As for the third share, I had them put it
                        in a separate apartment, close it off, and affix a seal to the door. The key I brought
                        to Bahá’u’lláh. “The task is done,” I said. “It was accomplished only through Your
                        confirmations. Otherwise it could not have been completed in a year. However, a difficulty
                        has arisen.” I described in detail the claim of Mírzá Músá and the absence of any
                        proof. Then I said, “Mírzá Músá is heavily in debt. Even should he expend all he has,
                        still he could not pay off his creditors. It is best, therefore, if You Yourself will
                        accept the heirs’ request, since they persist in their offer, and bestow that share
                        on Mírzá Músá. Then he could at least free himself from his debts and still have something
                        left over.”
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="024924837" class="brl-location"></a>On the following day the heirs appeared and implored the Blessed Beauty to have me
                        accept the third share. “This is out of the question,” He told them. Then they begged
                        and entreated Him to accept that share Himself and expend it for charitable purposes
                        of His own choice. He answered: “There is only one purpose for which I might expend
                        that sum.” They said, “That is no concern of ours, even if You have it thrown into
                        the sea. We will not loose our hold from the hem of Your garment and we will not cease
                        our importunities until You accede to our request.” Then He told them, “I have now
                        accepted this third share; and I have given it to Mírzá Músá, your brother, but on
                        the condition that, from this day forward, he will speak no more of any claim against
                        yourselves.” The heirs were profuse in their thanks. And so this weighty and difficult
                        case was settled in a single day. It left no residue of complaints, no uproar, no
                        further quarrels.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="990946358" class="brl-location"></a>Mírzá Músá did his best to urge some of the jewels on me, but I refused. Finally he
                        requested that I accept a single ring. It was a precious ring, set with a costly pomegranate
                        ruby, a flawless sphere, and unique. All around the central stone, it was gemmed with
                        diamonds. This too I refused, although I had no ‘abá to my back and nothing to wear
                        but a cotton tunic that bespoke the antiquity of the world, nor did I own a copper
                        coin. As Ḥáfiẓ would say: “An empty purse, but in our sleeve a hoard.”
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="550963720" class="brl-location"></a>Grateful for the bounty he had received, Mírzá Músá offered Bahá’u’lláh everything
                        he possessed: orchards, lands, estates—but it was refused. Then he appointed the ‘ulamás
                        of Iraq to intercede for him. They hastened to Bahá’u’lláh in a body and begged Him
                        to accept the proffered gifts. He categorically refused. They respectfully told Him:
                        “Unless You accept, in a very short time Mírzá Músá will scatter it all to the winds.
                        For his own good, he should not have access to this wealth.”
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="962729142" class="brl-location"></a>Then in his own hand, Mírzá Músá penned deeds of gift, made out according to each
                        of the five creeds, in Arabic and Persian; two copies he made, and chose the ‘ulamás
                        as his witnesses. Through certain ‘ulamás of Baghdad, among them the famed scholar
                        ‘Abdu’s-Salám Effendi, and the erudite and widely known Siyyid Dávúd Effendi, he presented
                        the deed of gift to Bahá’u’lláh. The Blessed Beauty told them: “We are appointing
                        Mírzá Músá himself as Our deputy.”
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="163027453" class="brl-location"></a>After Bahá’u’lláh’s departure for Rumelia, Mírzá Músá, with a promissory note, purchased
                        from the Government the tithes of Hindíyyih, a district near Karbilá, and suffered
                        a terrible loss, close to 100,000 túmáns. The Government confiscated his properties
                        and sold them for next to nothing. When told of the matter, Bahá’u’lláh said, “Do
                        not speak of this, ever again. Do not so much as utter a word about those estates.”
                        Meanwhile the exile from Adrianople to ‘Akká took place. Mírzá Muḥammad went to the
                        Government authorities and said to them: “I am the deputy (vakíl) of Bahá’u’lláh.
                        These properties do not belong to Mírzá Músá. How is it that you have taken them over?”
                        But he had no documents to support him, for the title deeds were in ‘Akká, and on
                        this account the Government rejected his claim. However, in the process, he became
                        known to all as Mírzá Muḥammad the Deputy. This is how he received the title.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="955639715" class="brl-location"></a>When we were in Adrianople, Mírzá Músá sent on the ruby ring, through Siyyid ‘Alí-Akbar,
                        and the Blessed Beauty directed us to accept it. After we reached ‘Akká the believers
                        fell ill, and lay suffering in their beds. I sent the ring to India, to one of the
                        friends, asking him to sell it with all possible speed and forward the proceeds to
                        us in ‘Akká to be expended on the sick. That blessed individual never sent us a penny.
                        Two years later he wrote to say that he had sold the ring for twenty-five pounds and
                        had spent that sum on the pilgrims. This, when the ring was of such great value. I
                        made no complaint. Rather, I praised God, thanking Him that out of all that wealth
                        not a fleck of dust had settled on my robe.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="525163082" class="brl-location"></a>Mírzá Muḥammad was taken prisoner and sent away from Baghdad to Mosul, where he fell
                        a prey to fearful ills. He had been rich; in God’s path he was now poor. He had enjoyed
                        his ease and comfort; now, for the love of God, he suffered pain and toil. He lived
                        on for a time in Mosul, suppliant, resigned, and lowly. And then, severed from all
                        save God, irresistibly drawn by the gentle gales of the Lord, he rose out of this
                        dark world to the land of light. Unto him be salutations and praise. May God shed
                        down upon him the waters of forgiveness, and open before his grave the gates of Heaven.

                        and faith. When the call of God was lifted up, that needy soul hurried into the shelter
                        of heavenly grace. As soon as he heard the summons, “Am I not your Lord?” he cried
                        out: “Yea, verily!”<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#002893178">1</a></sup> and became as a lamp to the people’s feet.

                        he went to the Holy Land, and there in utter submission and lowliness bowed his head
                        before the Sacred Threshold and was honored with entering the presence of Bahá’u’lláh,
                        where he drank in endless bounties from cupped hands. For quite a time he remained
                        there, attending upon Bahá’u’lláh almost every day, encompassed by holy favor and
                        grace. He was outstanding as to character, and lived after the commandments of God:
                        tranquil and long-suffering, in his surrender to God’s will he was selflessness itself.
                        He had no personal aims whatever, no feeling of attachment to this fleeting world.
                        His one desire was to please his Lord, his one hope, to walk the holy path.

                        and gaze upon that Most Great Beauty. Later, in Sidon, he fell ill. Unable to make

                        Kingdom, and was plunged in the ocean of lights. By the Supreme Pen, endless bounty
                        was bestowed upon his memory. He was indeed one of the loyal, the steadfast, a solid
                        pillar of servitude to Bahá’u’lláh. Many and many a time, from the lips of the Blessed
                        Beauty, we heard his praise.

                        and brimming over with red wine. In the flower of his youth he left Persia and traveled
                        to Greece, making his living as a merchant there; till a day came when, guided by
                        Divine bounty, he went from Greece to Smyrna, and there he was given the glad tidings
                        of a new Manifestation on earth. He shouted aloud, was frenzied, was drunk with the
                        music of the new message. He escaped from his debits and credits, set out to meet
                        the Lord of his heart, and entered the presence of Bahá’u’lláh. For some time, a trusted
                        attendant and companion, he served the Blessed Beauty. He was then directed to seek

                        of the Blessed Beauty, and remained for a time peaceful and serene. He carefully avoided
                        any occasion of being seduced into error, for he dreaded that the tempest of afflictions
                        might mount in fury, surge ever higher, and sweep many a soul into the fathomless

                        Sun of Truth had risen, he was filled with holy ecstasy, and he longed and loved.
                        The new fire burned away those veils of uncertainty and doubt that had closed him

                        Bahá’u’lláh; it was there that his meeting took place. His joy and fervor were boundless.
                        Later, at Bahá’u’lláh’s command he made a journey to Constantinople, with Áqá Muḥammad-Báqir
                        and Áqá ‘Abdu’l-<u>Gh</u>affár. In that city, the tyrannous imprisoned him and put him in chains.

Jam<u>sh</u>íd he described as a latter-day Rustam<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#117813523">1</a></sup> while Muḥammad-‘Alí, according to the envoy, was a ravening lion. These two respected
                        men were first imprisoned and caged; then they were sent out of Turkish territory,
                        under guard to the Persian frontier. They were to be delivered over to the Persian
                        Government and crucified, and the guards were threatened with terrible punishments
                        should they once relax their vigilance and let the prisoners escape. For this reason,
                        at every stopping place the victims were kept in some almost inaccessible spot. Once
                        they were thrown into a pit, a kind of well, and suffered agonies all through the
                        night. The next morning Jam<u>sh</u>íd cried out: “O you who oppress us! Are we Joseph the Prophet that you have thrown
                        us in this well? Remember how He rose out of the well as high as the full moon? We
                        too walk the pathway of God, we too are down here for His sake, and we know that these

                        who had fallen a prey to their enemies. Instead of dispatching them to the capital,
                        they set them free. Joyfully, the two hastened away on foot, went back to Bahá’u’lláh
                        and found a home close by Him in the Most Great Prison.

                        These three were like eagles soaring; they were three stars of the Faith, pulsing
                        with the light of the love of God.

                        <a id="253561178" class="brl-location"></a>Ḥájí Ḥasan was of the earlier day; he had believed from the new Luminary’s first dawning.
                        He was full of ardor, keen of mind. After his conversion he traveled everywhere, through
                        the cities and villages of Persia, and his breath moved the hearts of longing souls.
                        Then he left for Iraq, and on the Beloved’s first journey, attained His presence there.
                        Once he beheld that beauteous Light he was carried away to the Kingdom of Splendors;
                        he was incandescent, he became a thrall of yearning love. At this time he was directed
                        to go back to Persia. He was a peddler, a vendor of small wares, and would travel
                        from city to city.

                        <a id="903703292" class="brl-location"></a>On Bahá’u’lláh’s second journey to Iraq, Ḥájí Ḥasan longed to behold Him again, and
                        there in Baghdad was once more bedazzled by His presence. Every so often he would
                        journey to Persia and then return, his thoughts centered on teaching and furthering
                        the Cause. His business fell apart. His merchandise was carried away by thieves, and
                        thus, as he put it, his load was lifted from him—he was disencumbered. He shunned
                        every worldly tie. He was held fast as by a magnet; he fell hopelessly, madly in love
                        with the tender Companion, with Him Who is the Well-Beloved of both worlds. He was
                        known everywhere for the ecstasy he was in, and experienced strange states of being;
                        sometimes, with utmost eloquence, he would teach the Faith, adducing as proofs many
                        a sacred verse and holy tradition, and bringing sound and reasonable arguments to
                        bear. Then his hearers would comment on the power of his mind, on his wisdom and his
                        self-possession. But there were other times when love suddenly flamed within him,
                        and then he could not remain still for an instant. At those times he would skip, and
                        dance, or again in a loud voice he would cry out a verse from the poets, or a song.
                        Toward the end of his days he became a close friend of Jináb-i-Muníb; the two exchanged
                        many a recondite confidence, and each carried many a melody in his breast.

                        <a id="301345190" class="brl-location"></a>On the friends’ final journey he went to Á<u>dh</u>irbáyján, and there, throwing caution to the winds, he roared out the Greatest Name:
                        “Yá Bahá’u’l-Abhá!” The unbelievers there joined forces with his relatives, and they
                        lured that innocent, that man in his ecstasy, away to a garden. Here, they first put
                        questions to him and listened to his answers. He spoke out; he expounded the secret
                        verities of the Faith, and set forth conclusive proofs that the Advent had indeed
                        come to pass. He recited verses from the Qur’án, and traditions handed down from the
                        Prophet Muḥammad and the Holy Imáms. Following that, in a frenzy of love and longing
                        rapture, he began to sing. It was a <u>sh</u>ahnáz melody he sang; the words were from the poets, to say that the Lord had come.
                        And they killed him; they shed his blood. They wrenched and hacked his limbs apart
                        and hid his body underneath the dust.

                        <a id="619381438" class="brl-location"></a>As for Ḥájí Muḥammad-Ja‘far, the gently born, he too, like his brother, was bewitched
                        by the Blessed Beauty. It was in Iraq that he entered the presence of the Light of
                        the World, and he too caught fire with Divine love and was carried away by the gentle
                        gales of God. Like his brother, he was a vendor of small wares, always on a journey
                        from one place to the next. When Bahá’u’lláh left Baghdad for the capital of Islám,
                        Ḥájí Ja‘far was in Persia, and when the Blessed Beauty and His retinue came to a halt
                        in Adrianople, Ja‘far and Ḥájí Taqí, his brother, arrived there from Á<u>dh</u>irbáyján. They found a corner somewhere and settled down. Our oppressors then stretched
                        out arrogant hands to send Bahá’u’lláh forth to the Most Great Prison, and they forbade
                        the believers to accompany the true Beloved, for it was their purpose to bring the
                        Blessed Beauty to this prison with but a few of His people. When Ḥájí Ja‘far saw that
                        they had excluded him from the band of exiles, he seized a razor and slashed his throat.<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#420620726">1</a></sup> The crowds expressed their grief and horror and the authorities then permitted all
                        the believers to leave in company with Bahá’u’lláh—this because of the blessing that
                        came from Ja‘far’s act of love.

                        be sent on, along with your brother. Be sure of this.” Bahá’u’lláh also directed that
                        this be done. Accordingly, we left Ja‘far in the hospital and went on to the ‘Akká
                        prison. Two months later, he and his brother Ḥájí Taqí arrived at the fortress, and
                        joined the other prisoners. The safely delivered Ḥájí grew more loving, more ardent
                        with every passing day. From dusk till dawn he would stay awake, chanting prayers,
                        shedding his tears. Then one night he fell from the roof of the caravanserai and ascended
                        to the Kingdom of miracles and signs.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="091377491" class="brl-location"></a>Ḥájí Taqí, born under a fortunate star, was in every sense a true brother to Ḥájí
                        Ja‘far. He lived in the same spiritual condition, but he was calmer. After Ḥájí Ja‘far’s
                        death, he would stay in one room, all alone. He was silence itself. He would sit there,
                        all alone, properly and courteously, even during the night. One midnight he climbed
                        up to the roof to chant prayers. The next morning they found him where he had fallen,
                        on the ground by the wall. He was unconscious, and they could not tell whether this
                        was an accident or whether he had thrown himself down. When he came to himself he
                        said: “I was weary of this life, and I tried to die. Not for a moment do I wish to
                        linger in this world. Pray that I may go on.”
                     </p>

                        <a id="570301790" class="brl-location"></a>This, then, is the life story of those three brothers. All three were souls well-assured;
                        all three were pleased, and pleasing unto God.<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#440679073">2</a></sup> They were flames; they were captives of the Faith; they were pure and holy. And therefore,
                        cut off from the world, turning their faces toward the Most High Kingdom, they ascended.
                        May God wrap them in the garment of His grace in the realm of forgiveness, and immerse
                        them in the waters of His mercy forever and ever. Greetings be unto them, and praise.

                        was Jináb-i-Muḥammad-Taqí, the Afnán.<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#307285958">1</a></sup> His title was Vakílu’d-Dawlih. This eminent Bough was an offshoot of the Holy Tree;
                        in him an excellent character was allied to a noble lineage. His kinship was a true
                        kinship. He was among those souls who, after one reading of the Book of Íqán, became
                        believers, bewitched by the sweet savors of God, rejoicing at the recital of His verses.
                        His agitation was such that he cried out, “Lord, Lord, here am I!” Joyously, he left
                        Persia and hurried away to Iraq. Because he was filled with longing love, he sped
                        over the mountains and across the desert wastes, not pausing to rest until he came
                        to Baghdad.

                        <a id="222603338" class="brl-location"></a>He entered the presence of Bahá’u’lláh, and achieved acceptance in His sight. What
                        holy ecstasy he had, what fervor, what detachment from the world! It was beyond description.
                        His blessed face was so comely, so luminous that the friends in Iraq gave him a name:
                        they called him “the Afnán of all delights.” He was truly a blessed soul, a man worthy
                        to be revered. He never failed in his duty, from the beginning of life till his last
                        breath. As his days began, he became enamored of the sweet savors of God, and as they
                        closed, he rendered a supreme service to the Cause of God. His life was righteous,
                        his speech agreeable, his deeds worthy. Never did he fail in servitude, in devotion,
                        and he would set about a major undertaking with alacrity and joy. His life, his behavior,
                        what he did, what he left undone, his dealings with others—were all a way of teaching
                        the Faith, and served as an example, an admonishment to the rest.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="473975421" class="brl-location"></a>After he had achieved the honor, in Baghdad, of meeting Bahá’u’lláh, he returned to
                        Persia, where he proceeded to teach the Faith with an eloquent tongue. And this is
                        how to teach: with an eloquent tongue, a ready pen, a goodly character, pleasing words,
                        and righteous ways and deeds. Even enemies bore witness to his high-mindedness and
                        his spiritual qualities, and they would say: “There is none to compare with this man
                        for his words and acts, his righteousness, trustworthiness, and strong faith; in all
                        things he is unique; what a pity that he is a Bahá’í!” That is: “What a pity that
                        he is not as we are, perverse, uncaring, committing sins, engrossed in sensuality,
                        the creatures of our passions!” Gracious God! They saw with their own eyes that the
                        moment he learned of the Faith he was transformed, he was severed from the world,
                        he began to emit rays from the Sun of Truth; and still, they failed to profit by the
                        example he set.

                        <a id="580907609" class="brl-location"></a>During his days in Yazd he was, outwardly, engaged in commercial pursuits, but actually
                        teaching the Faith. His only aim was to exalt the Word of God, his only wish, to spread
                        the Divine sweet savors, his only thought, to come nearer and ever nearer to the mansions
                        of the Lord. There was no remembrance on his lips but the verses of God. He was an
                        embodiment of the good pleasure of Bahá’u’lláh, a dawning-point of the grace of the
                        Greatest Name. Many and many a time, Bahá’u’lláh expressed to those about Him, His
                        extreme satisfaction with the Afnán; and consequently, everyone was certain that he
                        would in future initiate some highly important task.

                        <a id="022394521" class="brl-location"></a>After the ascension of Bahá’u’lláh, the Afnán, loyal and staunch in the Covenant,
                        rendered even more services than he had before; this in spite of many obstacles, and
                        an overwhelming load of work, and an infinite variety of matters all claiming his
                        attention. He gave up his comfort, his business, his properties, estates, lands, hastened
                        away to ‘I<u>sh</u>qábád and set about building the Ma<u>sh</u>riqu’l-A<u>dh</u>kár; this was a service of very great magnitude, for he thus became the first individual
                        to erect a Bahá’í House of Worship, the first builder of a House to unify man. With
                        the believers in ‘I<u>sh</u>qábád assisting him, he succeeded in carrying off the palm. For a long period in ‘I<u>sh</u>qábád, he had no rest. Day and night, he urged the believers on. Then they too exerted
                        their efforts, and made sacrifices above and beyond their power; and God’s edifice
                        arose, and word of it spread throughout East and West. The Afnán expended everything
                        he possessed to rear this building, except for a trifling sum. This is the way to
                        make a sacrifice. This is what it means to be faithful.

                        <a id="006002682" class="brl-location"></a>Afterward he journeyed to the Holy Land, and there beside that place where the chosen
                        angels circle, in the shelter of the Shrine of the Báb, he passed his days, holy and
                        pure, supplicating and entreating the Lord. God’s praise was always on his lips, and
                        he chanted prayers with both his tongue and heart. He was wonderfully spiritual, strangely
                        ashine. He is one of those souls who, before ever the drumbeat of “Am I not your Lord?”
                        was sounded, drummed back: “Yea, verily Thou art!”<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#803217115">2</a></sup> It was in the Iraq period, during the years between the seventies and the eighties
                        of the Hijra, that he first caught fire and loved the Light of the World, beheld the
                        glory dawning in Bahá’u’lláh and witnessed the fulfillment of the words, “I am He
                        that liveth in the Abhá Realm of Glory!”

                        <a id="727483483" class="brl-location"></a>The Afnán was an uncommonly happy man. Whenever I was saddened, I would meet with
                        him, and on the instant, joy would return again. Praise be to God, at the last, close
                        by the Shrine of the Báb, he hastened away in light to the Abhá Realm; but the loss
                        of him deeply grieved ‘Abdu’l‑Bahá.

                        rays from the Paradise of Splendors, and lave that holy dust with the rains that beat
                        down from the retreats of the Exalted Companion. Upon him be the glory of the All-Glorious.

                        of inordinate desires, mired down in his physical passions. But the moment he became
                        a believer, he was carried away by the sweet savors of God, and was changed into a
                        new creation. He found himself in a strange rapture, completely transformed. He had
                        been of the world, now he was of Heaven; he had lived by the flesh, now he lived by
                        the spirit; he had walked in darkness, now he walked in light. He had been a slave
                        to his senses, now he was a thrall of God. He had been clay and earthenware before,
                        now he was a dear-bought pearl; a dull and lusterless stone before, now a ruby glowing.

                        <a id="673149248" class="brl-location"></a>Even among the nonbelievers, people were astonished at the change. What could have
                        come over this youth, they wanted to know; how did it happen that he was suddenly
                        detached from the world, eager and devoted? “He was tainted, corrupted,” they said;
                        “today he is abstemious and chaste. He was sunk in his appetites, but is now the soul
                        of purity, living a righteous life. He has left the world behind him. He has broken
                        up the feast, dismissed the revelers, and folded the banquet cloth away. His mind
                        is distracted by love.”

                        <a id="139809103" class="brl-location"></a>Briefly, he let go his pleasures and possessions, and journeyed to ‘Akká on foot.
                        His face had turned so bright, his nature so luminous, that it was a joy to look at
                        him. I used to say: “Áqá ‘Abdu’lláh, what condition are you in?” And he would answer
                        to this effect: “I was in darkness; now, by the favor of the Blessed Beauty, I am
                        in light. I was a heap of dust; He changed me to a fertile field. I was in constant
                        torment; I am now at peace. I was in love with my chains; He has broken them. I was
                        avid for this one and that; now I cling to the Lord. I was a bird in a cage; He let
                        me out. Today, though I live in the desert, and I have the bare ground for my bed
                        and pillow, it feels like silk. In the old time, my coverlet was satin, and my soul
                        was on the rack. Now I am homeless, and happy.”

                        He suffered. ‘Abdu’lláh yearned to die for Him. And thus it came about that he offered
                        up his life for his tender Companion, and hastened away, out of this dark world to
                        the country of light. His luminous grave is in ‘Akká. Upon him be the glory of the
                        All-Glorious; upon him be mercy, out of the grace of the Lord.

                        earth hath shone out with the light of her Lord!”<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#816160901">1</a></sup>

                        <a id="968191744" class="brl-location"></a>Gracious God! The opposition was powerful, the penalty obvious, the friends, every
                        one of them, terrified, and off in some corner hiding their belief; at such a time
                        this intrepid personality boldly went about his business, and like a man, faced up
                        to every tyrant. The one individual who, in the year seventy, was famed in Iraq for
                        his love of Bahá’u’lláh, was this honored person. A few other souls, then in Baghdad
                        and its environs, had crept away into nooks and crannies and, imprisoned in their
                        own lethargy, there they remained. But this admirable Muḥammad-Muṣṭafá would boldly,
                        proudly come and go like a man, and the hostile, because of his physical strength
                        and his courage, were afraid to attack him.

                        <a id="178160882" class="brl-location"></a>After Bahá’u’lláh’s return from His journey to Kurdistán, the virile strength and
                        bearing of that gallant individual was still further enhanced. Whenever leave was
                        granted, he would attend upon Bahá’u’lláh, and would hear from His lips expressions
                        of favor and grace. He was the leader, among all the friends in Iraq, and after the
                        great separation, when the convoy of the Beloved left for Constantinople, he remained
                        loyal and staunch, and withstood the foe. He girded himself for service and openly,
                        publicly, observed by all, taught the Faith.

                        <a id="625566131" class="brl-location"></a>As soon as Bahá’u’lláh’s declaration that He was “He Whom God Shall Manifest”<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#905177332">2</a></sup> had become known far and wide, Muḥammad-Muṣṭafá—being among those souls who had become
                        believers prior to this Declaration, and before the call was raised—cried out: “Verily,
                        we believe!” Because, even before this Declaration, the very light itself pierced
                        through the veils that had closed off the peoples of the world, so that every seeing
                        eye beheld the splendor, and every longing soul could look upon its Well-Beloved.

                        <a id="182588008" class="brl-location"></a>With all his strength, then, Muḥammad-Muṣṭafá arose to serve the Cause. He rested
                        neither day nor night. After the Ancient Beauty had departed to the Most Great Prison;
                        after the friends had been taken prisoner in Baghdad and sent away to Mosul; after
                        the hostility of outstanding enemies and the opposition of the populace of Baghdad,
                        he did not falter, but continued to stand his ground. A long time passed in this way.
                        But with his yearning for Bahá’u’lláh, the tumult in his heart was such that he set
                        out alone for the Most Great Prison. He reached there during the period of extreme
                        restrictions, and had the honor of entering the presence of Bahá’u’lláh.
                     </p>

                        <a id="508418022" class="brl-location"></a>He asked then for leave to find a lodging somewhere in the neighborhood of ‘Akká,
                        and was permitted to reside in Beirut. There he went and faithfully served the Cause,
                        assisting all the pilgrims as they arrived and departed. He was an excellent servitor,
                        a generous and kindly host, and he sacrificed himself to see to their affairs as they
                        passed through. For all this he became known everywhere.

                        <a id="489170580" class="brl-location"></a>When the Sun of Truth had set and the Light of the Concourse on high had ascended,
                        Muḥammad-Muṣṭafá remained loyal to the Covenant. He stood so firm against the waverers
                        that they dared not draw a breath. He was like a shooting star, a missile hurled against
                        the demons;<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#045432590">3</a></sup> against the violators, an avenging sword. Not one of the violators so much as dared
                        pass through the street where he lived and if they chanced to meet him they were like
                        those described in the Qur’án: “deaf, dumb, blind: therefore they shall not retrace
                        their steps from error!”<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#390106070">4</a></sup> He was the very embodiment of: “The blame of the blamer shall not deflect him from
                        the path of God, and the terrible might of the reviler shall not shake him.”
                     </p>

                        <a id="202008381" class="brl-location"></a>Living in the same manner as before, he served the believers with a free mind and
                        pure intent. With all his heart, he assisted the travelers to the Holy Land, those
                        who had come to circumambulate that place which is ringed around by the Company on
                        high. Later he moved from Beirut to Iskandarún, and there he spent some time, until,
                        drawn as if by a magnet to the Lord, detached from all save Him, rejoicing in His
                        glad tidings, holding fast to the cord that none can sever—he ascended on the wings
                        of the spirit to his Exalted Companion.

                        <a id="822397223" class="brl-location"></a>Sulaymán <u>Kh</u>án was the emigrant and settler who was given the title of Jamáli’d-Dín. He was born
                        in Tunukábán, into an old family of that region. He was cradled in wealth, bred to
                        ease, reared in the comfortable ways of luxury. From his early childhood he had high
                        ambitions and noble aims, and he was honor and aspiration personified. At first he
                        planned to outdistance all his fellows and achieve some lofty rank. For this reason
                        he left his birthplace and went to the capital, Ṭihrán, where he hoped to become a
                        leader, surpassing the rest of his generation.
                     </p>

                        <a id="875178318" class="brl-location"></a>In Ṭihrán, however, the fragrance of God was borne his way, and he listened to the
                        summons of the Well-Beloved. He was saved from the perturbations of high rank; from
                        all the din and clatter, the glory, the pomps and palaces, of this heap of dust, the
                        world. He threw off his chains, and by God’s grace, discovered peace. To him, the
                        seat of honor was now no different from the place where people removed their slippers
                        at the door, and high office was a thing soon gone and forgotten. He was cleansed
                        from the stain of living, his heart was eased, for he had burst the shackles that
                        held him to this present life.

                        <a id="507518882" class="brl-location"></a>Putting on the garments of a pilgrim, he set out to find his loving Friend, and came
                        to the Most Great Prison. Here for a time he rested, under the protection of the Ancient
                        Beauty; here he gained the honor of entering the presence of Bahá’u’lláh, and listened
                        to momentous teachings from His holy lips. When he had breathed the scented air, when
                        his eyes were illumined and his ears attuned to the words of the Lord, he was permitted
                        to make a journey to India, and bidden to teach the true seekers after truth.

                        <a id="774402826" class="brl-location"></a>Resting his heart on God, in love with the sweet savors of God, on fire with the love
                        of God, he left for India. There he wandered, and whenever he came to a city he raised
                        the call of the Great Kingdom and delivered the good news that the Speaker of the
                        Mount had come. He became one of God’s farmers, scattering the holy seed of the Teachings.
                        This sowing was fruitful. Through him a considerable number found their way into the
                        Ark of Salvation. The light of Divine guidance was shed upon those souls, and their
                        eyes were brightened with beholding the mighty signs of God. He became the focal point
                        of every gathering, the honored guest. To this day, in India, the results of his auspicious
                        presence are clear to see, and those whom he taught are now, in their turn, guiding
                        others to the Faith.

                        he shed his tears, and his heart was a thurible for sorrow. But he remained loyal
                        to the Covenant, well rooted in Heaven.

                        <a id="687908813" class="brl-location"></a>Not long before His passing, Bahá’u’lláh had said: “Should someone go to Persia, and
                        manage to convey it, this message must be delivered to Amínu’s-Sulṭán:<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#687594072">1</a></sup> ‘You took steps to help the prisoners; you freely rendered them a befitting service;
                        this service will not be forgotten. Rest assured that it will bring you honor and
                        call down a blessing upon all your affairs. O Amínu’s-Sulṭán! Every house that is
                        raised up will one day fall to ruin, except the house of God; that will grow more
                        massive and be better guarded day by day. Then serve the Court of God with all your
                        might, that you may discover the way to a home in Heaven, and found an edifice that
                        will endure forever.’” After the departure of Bahá’u’lláh, this message was conveyed
                        to Amínu’s-Sulṭán.

                        <a id="005040280" class="brl-location"></a>In Á<u>dh</u>irbáyján the Turkish clerics had brought down Áqá Siyyid Asadu’lláh, hunted him down
                        in Ardabíl and plotted to shed his blood; but the Governor, by a ruse, managed to
                        save him from being physically beaten and then murdered: he sent the victim to Tabríz
                        in chains, and from there had him conducted to Ṭihrán. Amínu’s-Sulṭán came to the
                        prisoner’s assistance and, in his own office, provided Asadu’lláh with a sanctuary.
                        One day when the Prime Minister was ill, Náṣiri’d-Dín <u>Sh</u>áh arrived to visit him. The Minister then explained the situation, and lavished praise
                        upon his captive; so much so that the <u>Sh</u>áh, as he left, showed great kindness to Asadu’lláh, and spoke words of consolation.
                        This, when at an earlier time, the captive would have been strung up at once to adorn
                        some gallows-tree, and shot down with a gun.

                        <a id="205020916" class="brl-location"></a>After a time Amínu’s-Sulṭán lost the Sovereign’s favor. Hated, in disgrace, he was
                        banished to the city of Qum. Thereupon this servant dispatched Sulaymán <u>Kh</u>án to Persia, carrying a prayer and a missive written by me. The prayer besought God’s
                        aid and bounty and succor for the fallen Minister, so that he might, from that corner
                        of oblivion, be recalled to favor. In the letter we clearly stated: “Prepare to return
                        to Ṭihrán. Soon will God’s help arrive; the light of grace will shine on you again;
                        with full authority again, you will find yourself free, and Prime Minister. This is
                        your reward for the efforts you exerted on behalf of a man who was oppressed.” That
                        letter and that prayer are today in the possession of the family of Amínu’s-Sulṭán.

                        shrine of the Immaculate.<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#482626101">2</a></sup> The relatives of Amínu’s-Sulṭán came to visit there; Sulaymán <u>Kh</u>án inquired after the fallen Minister and expressed the wish to meet him. When the
                        Minister learned of this, he sent for Sulaymán <u>Kh</u>án. Placing all his trust in God, Sulaymán <u>Kh</u>án hastened to the Minister’s house and, meeting him in private, presented the letter
                        from ‘Abdu’l‑Bahá. The Minister rose, and received the letter with extreme respect.
                        Then addressing the <u>Kh</u>án he said: “I had given up hope. If this longing is fulfilled, I will arise to serve;
                        I will preserve and uphold the friends of God.” Then he expressed his gratitude, indebtedness
                        and joy, and added, “Praise be to God, I hope again; I feel that by His aid, my dream
                        will come true.”

                        <a id="666617587" class="brl-location"></a>In brief, the Minister pledged himself to serve the friends, and Sulaymán <u>Kh</u>án took his leave. The Minister then desired to give him a sum of money to defray
                        the expenses of his journey, but Sulaymán <u>Kh</u>án refused, and despite the Minister’s insistence, would accept nothing. The <u>Kh</u>án had not yet reached the Holy Land on his return journey when Amínu’s-Sulṭán was
                        recalled from exile and immediately summoned to the Premiership again. He assumed
                        the position and functioned with full authority; and at first he did indeed support
                        the believers, but toward the end, in the case of the Yazd martyrdoms, he was neglectful.
                        He neither helped nor protected the sufferers in any way, nor would he listen to their
                        repeated pleas, until all of them were put to death. Accordingly he too was dismissed,
                        a ruined man; that flag which had flown so proudly was reversed, and that hoping heart
                        despaired.

                        He kept company with the believers until the day of inescapable death, when he set
                        out for the mansions of Him Who liveth, and dieth not. He turned his back on this
                        heap of dust, the world, and hurried away to the country of light. He broke out of
                        this cage of contingent being and soared into the endless, placeless Realm. May God
                        enfold him in the waters of His mercy, cause His forgiveness to rain down upon him,
                        and bestow on him the wonders of abounding grace. Salutations be unto him, and praise.

                        and many a time would accompany Him on foot to the Shrine of the Two Káẓims; this
                        was his great delight.

                        on a small business, trifling, but he was content with it, happy and at peace. Thus,

                        He was a man wise, understanding, in a tumult from drinking the wine of the love of

                        delight in the neighborhood of the Divine Presence, enjoying utter peace. Daytimes,
                        he would carry on his trade, and at night he would come in all haste to the door of
                        the house, to be with the friends. He was close to all those who were staunch and
                        true; he was full of courage; he was grateful to God, abstemious and chaste, expectant
                        of and relying on the bounty and grace of the Lord. He made his father’s lamp to shine,
                        brightened the household of ‘Abdu’l-Faṭṭáḥ, and left descendants to remain behind
                        him in this swiftly passing world.

                        For some time he lived in utter happiness and peace. Then those who had been taken

                        <a id="762972378" class="brl-location"></a>His name was Mírzá Áqá and he was spirit itself. He came from Ká<u>sh</u>án. In the days of the Báb, he was drawn to the sweet savors of God; it was then he
                        caught fire. He was a fine youth, handsome, full of charm and grace. He was a calligrapher
                        second to none, a poet, and he had as well a remarkable singing voice. He was wise
                        and perceptive; staunch in the Faith of God; a flame of God’s love, severed from all
                        but God.

                        <a id="327184146" class="brl-location"></a>During the years when Bahá’u’lláh resided in Iraq, Jináb-i-Muníb left Ká<u>sh</u>án and hastened to His presence. He went to live in a small and humble house, barely
                        managed to subsist, and set about committing to writing the words of God. On his brow,
                        the bestowals of the Manifestation were clear to see. In all this mortal world he
                        had only one possession, his daughter; and even his daughter he had left behind in
                        Persia, as he hurried away to Iraq.

                        <a id="854065220" class="brl-location"></a>At the time when, with all pomp and ceremony, Bahá’u’lláh and His retinue departed
                        from Baghdad, Jináb-i-Muníb accompanied the party on foot. The young man had been
                        known in Persia for his easy and agreeable life and his love of pleasure; also for
                        being somewhat soft and delicate, and used to having his own way. It is obvious what
                        a person of this type endured, going on foot from Baghdad to Constantinople. Still,
                        he gladly measured out the desert miles, and he spent his days and nights chanting
                        prayers, communing with God and calling upon Him.

                        He was a close companion of mine on that journey. There were nights when we would
                        walk, one to either side of the howdah of Bahá’u’lláh, and the joy we had defies description.
                        Some of those nights he would sing poems; among them he would chant the odes of Ḥáfiẓ,
                        like the one that begins, “<span class="brl-italic">Come, let us scatter these roses, let us pour out this wine,</span>”<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#575464886">1</a></sup> and that other:

                        <a id="519880036" class="brl-location"></a>The Blessed Beauty, at the time of His departure from Constantinople, directed Jináb-i-Muníb
                        to return to Persia and promulgate the Faith. Accordingly he went back, and over a
                        considerable period he rendered outstanding services, especially in Ṭihrán. Then he
                        came again, from Persia to Adrianople, and entered the presence of Bahá’u’lláh, enjoying
                        the privilege of attending upon Him. At the time of the greatest catastrophe, that
                        is, the exile to ‘Akká, he was made a prisoner on this Pathway and traveled, by now
                        feeble and ill, with the party of Bahá’u’lláh.
                     </p>

                        <a id="317552395" class="brl-location"></a>He had been stricken by a severe ailment and was pitifully weak. Still, he would not
                        agree to remaining behind in Adrianople where he could receive treatment, because
                        he wanted to sacrifice his life and fall at the feet of his Lord. We journeyed along
                        till we reached the sea. He was now so feeble that it took three men to lift him and
                        carry him onto the ship. Once he was on board, his condition grew so much worse that
                        the captain insisted we put him off the ship, but because of our repeated pleas he
                        waited till we reached Smyrna. In Smyrna, the captain addressed Colonel ‘Umar Bayk,
                        the government agent who accompanied us, and told him: “If you don’t put him ashore,
                        I will do it by force, because the ship will not accept passengers in this condition.”
                     </p>

                        <a id="562407131" class="brl-location"></a>We were compelled, then, to take Jináb-i-Muníb to the hospital at Smyrna. Weak as
                        he was, unable to utter a word, he dragged himself to Bahá’u’lláh, lay down at His
                        feet, and wept. On the countenance of Bahá’u’lláh as well, there was intense pain.
                     </p>

                        <a id="203195164" class="brl-location"></a>We carried Jináb-i-Muníb to the hospital, but the functionaries allowed us not more
                        than one hour’s time. We laid him down on the bed; we laid his fair head on the pillow;
                        we held him and kissed him many times. Then they forced us away. It is clear how we
                        felt. Whenever I think of that moment, the tears come; my heart is heavy and I summon
                        up the remembrance of what he was. A great man; infinitely wise, he was, steadfast,
                        modest and grave; and there was no one like him for faith and certitude. In him the
                        inner and outer perfections, the spiritual and physical, were joined together. That
                        is why he could receive endless bounty and grace.

                        <a id="364368817" class="brl-location"></a>His grave is in Smyrna, but it is off by itself, and deserted. Whenever this can be
                        done, the friends must search for it, and that neglected dust must be changed into
                        a much-frequented shrine,<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#084291444">2</a></sup> so that pilgrims who visit there may breathe in the sweet scent of his last resting-place.

                        Naráq and one of the earliest believers. His face shone with the love of God. His
                        mind was concerned with the anemones of mystic meanings, fair as meadows and beds

                        <a id="243927413" class="brl-location"></a>It was in the days of the Báb that he first set his lips to the intoxicating cup of
                        spiritual truth, and he had a strange tumult in his brain, a fierce yearning in his
                        heart. In the path of God he threw down whatever he possessed; he gambled everything
                        away, gave up his home, his kin, his physical well-being, his peace of mind. Like
                        a fish on the sand, he struggled to reach the water of life. He came to Iraq, joined
                        the friends of his soul, and entered the presence of Bahá’u’lláh. For some time he
                        lived there, joyful and content, receiving endless bounty. Then he was sent back to
                        Persia, where, to the utmost of his capacity, he served the Faith. He was a whole
                        and accomplished man, staunch, firmly rooted as the hills; sound, and worthy of trust.
                        To him, in all that turmoil and panic, the wild dogs howling were only buzzing flies;
                        tests and trials rested his mind; when cast into the fire of afflictions that broke
                        out, he proved to be shining gold.

                        Mírzá Muṣṭafá arrived from Persia. There was no opportunity for him to reach Bahá’u’lláh
                        except once; and he was thereupon directed to return to Persia. At such a moment he
                        had the honor of being received.

                        and there in Tabríz he drank of a brimming cup. His fervor increased, his teaching
                        raised a tumult. Then the eminent scholar, the renowned <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Aḥmad-i-<u>Kh</u>urásání, came to Á<u>dh</u>irbáyján and the two of them joined forces. The result was such overwhelming spiritual
                        fire that they taught the Faith openly and publicly and the people of Tabríz rose

                        Muṣṭafá took off his hat and down fell the locks of hair. “Behold!” he told them.
                        “I am the one.” They arrested him then. They tortured him and <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Aḥmad until finally, in Tabríz, those two great men drained the cup of death and,

                        He was the leader and spiritual exemplar of the entire population of Najaf-Ábád, and
                        the eminent of that area showed him unbounded respect. When he spoke out, his was
                        the deciding opinion; when he passed judgment, it took effect; for he was known to

                        us to the Faith—‘Believe ye on your Lord’—and we have believed.”<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#155949125">1</a></sup> He rid himself of all impeding veils; his doubts dispelled, he began to extol and
                        glorify the Beauty promised from of old. In his own home, and at Iṣfahán, he became
                        notorious for declaring far and wide that the advent of the long-desired One had come
                        to pass. By the hypocrites, he was mocked, cursed and tormented. As for the people,
                        “the mass, as a snake in the grass,” who had worshiped him before, now rose up to
                        do him harm. Every day brought on a fresh cruelty, a new torment from his oppressors.
                        He endured it all, and went on teaching with great eloquence. He remained staunch,
                        unmoved, as their wrath increased. In his hands he held out a full cup of Divine glad
                        tidings, offering to all who came that heady draught of the knowledge of God. He was

                        affliction. And since his staying on in Najaf-Ábád at such a time was a great danger
                        to the believers, he left there and traveled to Iraq. It was during the period when
                        the Blessed Beauty was in Kurdistán, when He had gone into seclusion and was living
                        in the cave on Sar-Galú, that Jináb-i-Zayn arrived in Baghdad. But his hopes were
                        dashed, his heart grieved, for all was silence: there was no word of the Cause of
                        God, no name nor fame of it; there were no gatherings, no call was being raised. Yaḥyá,
                        terror-stricken, had vanished into some dark hiding place. Torpid, flaccid, he had
                        made himself invisible. Try as he might, Jináb-i-Zayn could find not one soul. He
                        met on a single occasion with His Eminence Kalím. But it was a period when great caution
                        was being exercised by the believers, and he went on to Karbilá. He spent some time
                        there, and occupied himself with copying out the Writings, after which he returned
                        home to Najaf-Ábád. Here the foul persecutions and attacks of his relentless enemies
                        could hardly be endured.

                        <a id="571548363" class="brl-location"></a>But when the Trump had been sounded a second time,<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#094965315">2</a></sup> he was restored to life. To the tidings of Bahá’u’lláh’s advent his soul replied;
                        to the drum beat, “Am I not your Lord?” his heart drummed back: “Yea, verily!”<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#606883548">3</a></sup> Eloquently, he taught again, using both rational and historical proofs to establish
                        that He Whom God Shall Manifest—the Promised One of the Báb—had indeed appeared. He
                        was like refreshing waters to those who thirsted, and to seekers, a clear answer from
                        the Concourse on high. In his writing and speaking, he was first among the righteous,
                        in his elucidations and commentaries a mighty sign of God.

                        <a id="846613043" class="brl-location"></a>In Persia his life was in imminent peril; and since remaining at Najaf-Ábád would
                        have stirred up the agitators and brought on riots, he hastened away to Adrianople,
                        seeking sanctuary with God, and crying out as he went, “Lord, Lord, here am I!” Wearing
                        the lover’s pilgrim dress, he reached the Mecca of his longing. For some time he tarried
                        there, in the presence of Bahá’u’lláh, after which he was commanded to leave, with
                        Jináb-i-Mírzá Ja‘far-i-Yazdí, and promulgate the Faith. He returned to Persia and
                        began to teach most eloquently, so that the glad tidings of the Lord’s advent resounded
                        to the high heavens. In the company of Mírzá Ja‘far he traveled everywhere, through
                        cities flourishing and ruined, spreading the good news that the Blessed Beauty was
                        now manifest.

                        <a id="681334313" class="brl-location"></a>Once again, he returned to Iraq, where he was the center of every gathering, and rejoiced
                        his hearers. At all times, he gave wise counsel; at all times he was consumed with
                        the love of God.

                        <a id="337594820" class="brl-location"></a>When the believers were taken prisoner in Iraq and banished to Mosul, Jináb-i-Zayn
                        became their chief. He remained for some time in Mosul, a consolation to the rest,
                        working to solve their many problems. He would kindle love in people’s hearts, and
                        make them kind to one another. Later he asked for permission to attend upon Bahá’u’lláh;
                        when this was granted he arrived at the Prison and had the honor of entering the presence
                        of his Well-Beloved. He then busied himself with writing down the sacred verses, and
                        encouraging the friends. He was love itself to the emigrants, and warmed the travelers’
                        hearts. He never rested for a moment, and received new grace and bounty every day,
                        meanwhile taking down the Bahá’í Scriptures with faultless care.

                        <a id="764584736" class="brl-location"></a>From his early years till his last breath, this eminent man never failed in service
                        to the Manifestation. After the ascension he was consumed with such grieving, such
                        constant tears and anguish, that as the days passed by, he wasted away. He remained
                        faithful to the Covenant, and was a close companion to this servant of the Light of
                        the World, but he longed to rise out of this life, and awaited his departure from
                        day to day. At last, serene and happy, rejoicing in the tidings of the Kingdom, he
                        soared away to that mysterious land. There he was loosed from every sorrow, and in
                        the gathering-place of splendors he was immersed in light.

                        He was one of the earliest believers, and belonged to the company of the faithful.
                        It was in Persia that he won the honor of belief, and began to assist the friends;
                        he was a servant to every believer, a trusted helper to every traveler. With Músáy-i-Qumí,
                        upon whom be the glory of God, he came to Iraq, received his portion of bounty from
                        the Light of the World, and was honored with entering the presence of Bahá’u’lláh,
                        attending upon Him and becoming the object of bestowals and grace.

                        <a id="398521255" class="brl-location"></a>After a time, ‘Aẓím and Ḥájí Mírzá Músá went back to Persia, where he continued to
                        render service to the friends, purely for God’s sake. Without wage or stipend he served
                        Mírzá Naṣru’lláh of Tafrí<u>sh</u> for a number of years, his faith and certitude growing stronger with every passing
                        day. Mírzá Naṣru’lláh then left Persia for Adrianople, and in his company came Jináb-i-‘Aẓím,
                        and entered the presence of Bahá’u’lláh. He kept on serving with love and loyalty,
                        purely for the sake of God; and when the convoy departed for ‘Akká, ‘Aẓím received
                        the distinction of accompanying Bahá’u’lláh, and he entered the Most Great Prison.

                        <a id="738289759" class="brl-location"></a>In the prison he was chosen to serve the Household; he became the water carrier both
                        within doors and on the outside. He undertook many hard tasks in the barracks. He
                        had no rest at all, day or night. ‘Aẓím—“the great, the magnificent”—was magnificent
                        as to character. He was patient, long-suffering, forbearing, shunning the stain of
                        this earth. And since he was the family water carrier, he had the honor of coming
                        into Bahá’u’lláh’s presence every day.

                        happiness to all of them, the present and the absent as well. Many and many a time,
                        Bahá’u’lláh was heard to express His approval of this man. He always maintained the
                        same inner condition; he was constant, never subject to change. He was always happy-looking.
                        He did not know the meaning of fatigue. He was never despondent. When anyone asked
                        a service of him, he performed it at once. He was staunch and firm in his faith, a
                        tree that grew in the scented garden of God’s tenderness.

                        the world that does not die. The friends, all of them, mourned his passing, but the
                        Blessed Beauty eased their hearts, for He lavished grace and praise on him who was
                        gone.

                        well versed in many branches of knowledge. For a long time he was in the schools,
                        specializing in the fundamentals of religion and religious jurisprudence, and making
                        researches into philosophy and metaphysics, logic and history, the contemplative and

                        this repelled him. It was then that he heard the cry out of the Supreme Concourse,
                        and without a moment’s hesitation he raised up his voice and shouted, “Yea, verily!”;
                        and he repeated the words, “O our Lord! We have heard the voice of one that called.

                        to Najaf, the noble city; here for safety’s sake he mingled with the scholars of religion,
                        becoming renowned among them for his own wide knowledge. Then, listening to the voice
                        from Baghdad, he hastened there, and changed his mode of dress. That is, he put a
                        layman’s hat on his head, and went to work as a carpenter to earn his living. He traveled
                        once to Ṭihrán, returned, and sheltered by the grace of Bahá’u’lláh was patient and
                        content, rejoicing in his garb of poverty. In spite of his great learning he was humble,
                        self-effacing, lowly. He kept silent at all times, and was a good companion to every
                        sort of man.

                        of travel, would rest or sleep. Mírzá Ja‘far and I would go here and there to the

                        speech, in all things relying entirely upon God. He continued to serve in Adrianople
                        until the banishment to ‘Akká was brought about and he too was made a prisoner. He
                        was grateful for this, continually offering thanks, and saying, “Praise be to God!

                        At the time when we were in the barracks he fell dangerously ill and was confined
                        to his bed. He suffered many complications, until finally the doctor gave him up and
                        would visit him no more. Then the sick man breathed his last. Mírzá Áqá Ján ran to
                        Bahá’u’lláh, with word of the death. Not only had the patient ceased to breathe, but
                        his body was already going limp. His family were gathered about him, mourning him,
                        shedding bitter tears. The Blessed Beauty said, “Go; chant the prayer of Yá <u>Sh</u>áfí—O Thou, the Healer—and Mírzá Ja‘far will come alive. Very rapidly, he will be
                        as well as ever.” I reached his bedside. His body was cold and all the signs of death
                        were present. Slowly, he began to stir; soon he could move his limbs, and before an
                        hour had passed he lifted his head, sat up, and proceeded to laugh and tell jokes.

                        <a id="704475924" class="brl-location"></a>He lived for a long time after that, occupied as ever with serving the friends. This
                        giving service was a point of pride with him: to all, he was a servant. He was always
                        modest and humble, calling God to mind, and to the highest degree full of hope and
                        faith. Finally, while in the Most Great Prison, he abandoned this earthly life and
                        winged his way to the life beyond.

                        <a id="442525571" class="brl-location"></a>This man who was close to the Divine Threshold was the respected son of ‘Alí-‘Askar-i-Tabrízí.
                        Full of yearning love, he came with his father from Tabríz to Adrianople, and by his
                        own wish, went on with joy and hope to the Most Great Prison. From the day of his
                        arrival at the fortress of ‘Akká he took over the coffee service, and waited upon
                        the friends. This accomplished man was so patient, so docile, that over a forty-year
                        period, despite extreme difficulties (for day and night, friend and stranger alike
                        thronged the doors), he attended upon each and every one who came, faithfully helping
                        them all. During all that time Ḥusayn-Áqá never offended a soul, nor did anyone, where
                        he was concerned, utter a single complaint. This was truly a miracle, and no one else
                        could have established such a record of service. He was always smiling, attentive
                        as to the tasks committed to his care, known as a man to trust. In the Cause of God
                        he was staunch, proud and true; in times of calamity he was patient and long-suffering.

                        <a id="897887262" class="brl-location"></a>After the ascension of Bahá’u’lláh the fires of tests leaped up and a whirlwind of
                        violation battered the edifice down. This believer, in spite of a close tie of kinship,
                        remained loyal, showing such strength and firmness that he manifested the words: “In
                        the Cause of God, the blame of the blamer shall he not fear.”<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#367091758">1</a></sup> Not for a moment did he hesitate, nor waver in his faith, but he stood firm as a
                        mountain, proud as an impregnable citadel, and rooted deep.
                     </p>

                        <a id="153404880" class="brl-location"></a>The Covenant-breakers took his mother away to their own place, where her daughter
                        lived. They did everything they could think of to unsettle her faith. To an extent
                        beyond belief, they lavished favors upon her, and plied her with kindnesses, hiding
                        the fact that they had broken the Covenant. Finally, however, that respected handmaid
                        of Bahá’u’lláh detected the odor of violation, whereupon she instantly quit the Mansion
                        of Bahjí and hurried back to ‘Akká. “I am the handmaid of the Blessed Beauty,” she
                        said, “and loyal to His Covenant and Testament. Though my son-in-law were a prince
                        of the realm, what would that profit me? I am not to be won over by kinship and displays
                        of affection. I am not concerned with external tokens of friendliness from those who
                        are the very embodiment of selfish desire. I stand by the Covenant, and I hold to
                        the Testament.” She would not consent to meet with the Covenant-breakers again; she
                        freed herself completely from them, and turned her face to God.

                        <a id="262528874" class="brl-location"></a>As for Ḥusayn-Áqá, never did he separate himself from ‘Abdu’l‑Bahá. He had the utmost
                        consideration for me and was my constant companion, and it followed that his passing
                        was a formidable blow. Even now, whenever he comes to mind I grieve, and mourn his
                        loss. But God be praised that this man of God, in the days of the Blessed Beauty,
                        remained at all times in close proximity to His House, and was the object of His good
                        pleasure. Time and again, Bahá’u’lláh was heard to comment that Ḥusayn-Áqá had been
                        created to perform this service.

                        to the realms of God. Greetings and praise be unto him, and mercy from his bountiful
                        Lord. May his grave be encircled with lights that stream from the exalted Companion.
                        His resting-place is in Haifa.

                        piety and strong faith. The people of Tabríz, one and all, acknowledged his excellence
                        and praised his character and way of life, his qualities and talents. He was one of
                        the earliest believers, and one of the most notable.

                        <a id="420429077" class="brl-location"></a>When the Trumpet first sounded, he fainted away, and at the second blast, he was awakened
                        to new life.<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#013528260">1</a></sup> He became a candle burning with the love of God, a goodly tree in the Abhá gardens.
                        He led all his household, his other kindred and his friends to the Faith, and successfully
                        rendered many services; but the tyranny of the wicked brought him to an agonizing
                        pass, and he was beset by new afflictions every day. Still, he did not slacken and
                        was not dispirited; on the contrary, his faith, his certitude and self-sacrifice increased.
                        Finally he could endure his homeland no more. Accompanied by his family, he arrived
                        in Adrianople, and here, in financial straits, but content, he spent his days, with
                        dignity, patience, acquiescence, and offering thanks.

                        <a id="074724606" class="brl-location"></a>Then he took a little merchandise with him from Adrianople, and left for the city
                        of Jum‘ih-Bázár, to earn his livelihood. What he had with him was trifling, but still,
                        it was carried off by thieves. When the Persian Consul learned of this he presented
                        a document to the Government, naming an enormous sum as the value of the stolen goods.
                        By chance the thieves were caught and proved to be in possession of considerable funds.
                        It was decided to investigate the case. The Consul called in Ḥájí ‘Alí-‘Askar and
                        told him: “These thieves are very rich. In my report to the Government, I wrote that
                        the amount of the theft was great. Therefore you must attend the trial and testify
                        conformably to what I wrote.”

                        <a id="438265192" class="brl-location"></a>The Ḥájí replied: “Your Honor, <u>Kh</u>án, the stolen goods amounted to very little. How can I report something that is not
                        true? When they question me, I will give the facts exactly as they are. I consider
                        this my duty, and only this.”
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="282064881" class="brl-location"></a>“Ḥájí,” said the Consul, “We have a golden opportunity here; you and I can both profit
                        by it. Don’t let such a once-in-a-lifetime chance slip through your hands.”
                     </p>

                        <a id="090641384" class="brl-location"></a>The Ḥájí answered: “<u>Kh</u>án, how would I square it with God? Let me be. I shall tell the truth and nothing
                        but the truth.”
                     </p>

                        <a id="057495509" class="brl-location"></a>The Consul was beside himself. He began to threaten and belabor ‘Alí-‘Askar. “Do you
                        want to make me out a liar?” he cried. “Do you want to make me a laughingstock? I
                        will jail you; I will have you banished; there is no torment I will spare you. This
                        very instant I will hand you over to the police, and I will tell them that you are
                        an enemy of the state, and that you are to be manacled and taken to the Persian frontier.”
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="764011757" class="brl-location"></a>The Ḥájí only smiled. “Jináb-i-<u>Kh</u>án,” he said. “I have given up my life for the truth. I have nothing else. You are
                        telling me to lie and bear false witness. Do with me as you please; I will not turn
                        my back on what is right.”
                     </p>

                        <a id="697400585" class="brl-location"></a>When the Consul saw that there was no way to make ‘Alí-‘Askar testify to a falsehood,
                        he said: “It is better, then, for you to leave this place, so that I can inform the
                        Government that the owner of the merchandise is no longer available and has gone away.
                        Otherwise I shall be disgraced.”

                        <a id="284553800" class="brl-location"></a>The Ḥájí returned to Adrianople, and spoke not a word as to his stolen goods, but
                        the matter became public knowledge and caused considerable surprise.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="797071156" class="brl-location"></a>That fine and rare old man was taken captive in Adrianople along with the rest, and
                        he accompanied the Blessed Beauty to the ‘Akká fortress, this prison-house of sorrows.
                        With all his family, he was jailed in the path of God for a period of years; and he
                        was always offering thanks, because the prison was a palace to him, and captivity
                        a reason to rejoice. In all those years he was never known to express himself except
                        in thankfulness and praise. The greater the tyranny of the oppressors, the happier
                        he was. Time and again Bahá’u’lláh was heard to speak of him with loving kindness,
                        and He would say: “I am pleased with him.” This man, who was spirit personified, remained
                        constant, true, and joyful to the end. When some years had passed, he exchanged this
                        world of dust for the Kingdom that is undefiled, and he left powerful influences behind.
                     </p>

                        <a id="553631890" class="brl-location"></a>As a rule, he was the close companion of ‘Abdu’l‑Bahá. One day, at the beginning of
                        our time in the Prison, I hurried to the corner of the barracks where he lived—the
                        cell that was his shabby nest. He was lying there, running a high fever, out of his
                        head. On his right side lay his wife, shaking and trembling with chills. To his left
                        was his daughter, Fáṭimih, burning up with typhus. Beyond them his son, Ḥusayn-Áqá,
                        was down with scarlet fever; he had forgotten how to speak Persian, and he kept crying
                        out in Turkish, “My insides are on fire!” At the father’s feet lay the other daughter,
                        deep in her sickness, and along the side of the wall was his brother, Ma<u>sh</u>hadí Faṭṭáḥ, raving and delirious. In this condition, ‘Alí-‘Askar’s lips were moving:
                        he was returning thanks to God, and expressing joy.
                     </p>

                        <a id="537358184" class="brl-location"></a>Praise be to God! He died in the Most Great Prison, still patient and thankful, still
                        with dignity and firm in his faith. He rose up to the retreats of the compassionate
                        Lord. Upon him be the glory of the All-Glorious; to him be salutations and praise:
                        upon him be mercy and forgiveness forever and ever.

                        every night he entertained the friends at supper. Being host in this way to friends
                        in the spirit, he guided many seekers to the Faith, attracting them with the melody
                        of the love of God. He was amazingly constant, energetic, and persevering.

                        at the ‘Akká fortress. He had been afflicted with many a hardship on his journey,
                        but his longing to see Bahá’u’lláh was such that he found the calamities easy to endure;
                        and so he measured off the miles, looking for a home in God’s sheltering grace.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="701597080" class="brl-location"></a>At first he had means; life was comfortable and pleasant. Later on, however, he was
                        destitute and subjected to terrible ordeals. Most of the time his food was bread,
                        nothing else; instead of tea, he drank from a running brook. Still, he remained happy
                        and content. His great joy was to enter the presence of Bahá’u’lláh; reunion with
                        his Beloved was bounty enough; his food was to look upon the beauty of the Manifestation;
                        his wine, to be with Bahá’u’lláh. He was always smiling, always silent; but at the
                        same time, his heart shouted, leapt and danced.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="675631702" class="brl-location"></a>Often, he was in the company of ‘Abdu’l‑Bahá. He was an excellent friend and comrade,
                        happy, delightful; favored by Bahá’u’lláh, respected by the friends, shunning the
                        world, trusting in God. There was no fickleness in him, his inner condition was always
                        the same: stable, constant, firmly rooted as the hills.
                     </p>

                        Whenever I call him to mind, and remember that patience and serenity, that loyalty,
                        that contentment, involuntarily I find myself asking God to shed His bounties upon
                        Áqá ‘Alí. Misfortunes and calamities were forever descending on that estimable man.
                        He was always ill, continually subjected to unnumbered physical afflictions. The reason
                        was that when at home and serving the Faith in Qazvín, he was caught by the malevolent
                        and they beat him so brutally over the head that the effects stayed with him till
                        his dying hour. They abused and tormented him in many ways and thought it permissible
                        to inflict every kind of cruelty upon him; yet his only crime was to have become a
                        believer, and his only sin, to have loved God. As the poet has written, in lines that
                        illustrate the plight of Áqá ‘Alí:
                        <span class="brl-linegroup brl-global-verse brl-italic brl-topmargin brl-btmmargin">

                           <span class="brl-linegroupline">They rend his wings, though he is free of sin.</span>
                           <span class="brl-linegroupline">“Why”—so they mock—“do you remember yet</span>
                           <span class="brl-linegroupline">That royal wrist, that palace you were in?”</span>
                           <span class="brl-linegroupline">He is a kingly bird: this crime he did commit.</span>
                           <span class="brl-linegroupline">Except for beauty, what was Joseph’s sin?</span>
                           </span>
                        
                     </p>

                        <a id="022578707" class="brl-location"></a>Briefly, that great man spent his time in the ‘Akká prison, praying, supplicating,
                        turning his face toward God. Infinite bounty enfolded him; he was favored by Bahá’u’lláh,
                        much of the time admitted to His presence and showered with endless grace. This was
                        his joy and his delight, his great good fortune, his dearest wish.
                     </p>

                        <a id="068099284" class="brl-location"></a>Then the fixed hour was upon him, the daybreak of his hopes, and it came his turn
                        to soar away, into the invisible realm. Sheltered under the protection of Bahá’u’lláh,
                        he went swiftly forth to that mysterious land. To him be salutations and praise and
                        mercy from the Lord of this world and the world to come. May God light up his resting-place
                        with rays from the Companion on high.

                        <a id="494422823" class="brl-location"></a>These were two brothers who, in the path of God, captives along with the rest, were
                        shut in the ‘Akká fortress. They were brothers of the late Pahlaván Riḍá. They left
                        Persia and emigrated to Adrianople, hastening to the loving-kindness of Bahá’u’lláh;
                        and under His protection, they came to ‘Akká.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="312361410" class="brl-location"></a>Pahlaván Riḍá—God’s mercy and blessings and splendors be upon him; praise and salutations
                        be unto him—was a man to outward seeming untutored, devoid of learning. He was a tradesman,
                        and like the others who came in at the start, he cast everything away out of love
                        for God, attaining in one leap the highest reaches of knowledge. He is of those from
                        the earlier time. So eloquent did he suddenly become that the people of Ká<u>sh</u>án were astounded. For example this man, to all appearances unschooled, betook himself
                        to Ḥájí Muḥammad-Karím <u>Kh</u>án in Ká<u>sh</u>án and propounded this question:
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="401070715" class="brl-location"></a>“Sir, are you the Fourth Pillar? I am a man who thirsts after spiritual truth and
                        I yearn to know of the Fourth Pillar.”<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#341680121">1</a></sup>
                        
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="557257589" class="brl-location"></a>Since a number of political and military leaders were present, the Ḥájí replied: “Perish
                        the thought! I shun all those who consider me the Fourth Pillar. Never have I made
                        such a claim. Whoever says I have, speaks falsehood; may God’s curse be on him!”
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="474238701" class="brl-location"></a>A few days later Pahlaván Riḍá again sought out the Ḥájí and told him: “Sir, I have
                        just finished your book, <em>Ir<u>sh</u>ádu’l-‘Avám</em> (Guidance unto the Ignorant); I have read it from cover to cover; in it you say that
                        one is obligated to know the Fourth Pillar or Fourth Support; indeed, you account
                        him a fellow knight of the Lord of the Age.<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#353925795">2</a></sup> Therefore I long to recognize and know him. I am certain that you are informed of
                        him. Show him to me, I beg of you.”
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="004857239" class="brl-location"></a>The Ḥájí was wrathful. He said: “The Fourth Pillar is no figment. He is a being plainly
                        visible to all. Like me, he has a turban on his head, he wears an ‘abá, and carries
                        a cane in his hand.” Pahlaván Riḍá smiled at him. “Meaning no discourtesy,” he said,
                        “there is, then, a contradiction in Your Honor’s teaching. First you say one thing,
                        then you say another.”
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="932877621" class="brl-location"></a>Furious, the Ḥájí replied: “I am busy now. Let us discuss this matter some other time.
                        Today I must ask to be excused.”
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="921613869" class="brl-location"></a>The point is that Riḍá, a man considered to be unlettered, was able, in an argument,
                        to best such an erudite “Fourth Pillar.” In the phrase of ‘Allámiy-i-Ḥillí, he downed
                        him with the Fourth Support.<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#640413494">3</a></sup>
                        
                     </p>

                        <a id="103821255" class="brl-location"></a>Whenever that lionhearted champion of knowledge began to speak, his listeners marveled;
                        and he remained, till his last breath, the protector and helper of all seekers after
                        truth. Ultimately he became known far and wide as a Bahá’í, was turned into a vagrant,
                        and ascended to the Abhá Kingdom.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="947695813" class="brl-location"></a>As for his two brothers: through the grace of the Blessed Beauty, after they were
                        taken captive by the tyrants, they were shut in the Most Great Prison, where they
                        shared the lot of these homeless wanderers. Here, during the early days at ‘Akká,
                        with complete detachment, with ardent love, they hastened away to the all-glorious
                        Realm. For our ruthless oppressors, as soon as we arrived, imprisoned all of us inside
                        the fortress in the soldiers’ barracks, and they closed up every issue, so that none
                        could come and go. At that time the air of ‘Akká was poisonous, and every stranger,
                        immediately following his arrival, would be taken ill. Muḥammad-Báqir and Muḥammad-Ismá‘íl
                        came down with a violent ailment and there was neither doctor nor medicine to be had;
                        and those two embodied lights died on the same night, wrapped in each other’s arms.
                        They rose up to the undying Kingdom, leaving the friends to mourn them forever. There
                        was none there but wept that night.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="330814929" class="brl-location"></a>When morning came we wished to carry their sanctified bodies away. The oppressors
                        told us: “You are forbidden to go out of the fortress. You must hand over these two
                        corpses to us. We will wash them, shroud them and bury them. But first you must pay
                        for it.” It happened that we had no money. There was a prayer carpet which had been
                        placed under the feet of Bahá’u’lláh. He took up this carpet and said, “Sell it. Give
                        the money to the guards.” The prayer carpet was sold for 170 piasters<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#409952651">4</a></sup> and that sum was handed over. But the two were never washed for their burial nor
                        wrapped in their winding sheets; the guards only dug a hole in the ground and thrust
                        them in, as they were, in the clothes they had on; so that even now, their two graves
                        are one, and just as their souls are joined in the Abhá Realm, their bodies are together
                        here, under the earth, each holding the other in his close embrace.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="784683500" class="brl-location"></a>The Blessed Beauty showered His blessings on these two brothers. In life, they were
                        encompassed by His grace and favor; in death, they were memorialized in His Tablets.
                        Their grave is in ‘Akká. Greetings be unto them, and praise. The glory of the All-Glorious
                        be upon them, and God’s mercy, and His benediction.

                        alive through the breathings of the Faithful Spirit they hastened out of Persia to
                        Adrianople, for such was the unabating cruelty of the malevolent that they could no
                        longer remain in their own home. On foot, free of every tie, they took to the plains
                        and hills, seeking their way across trackless waters and desert sands. How many a
                        night they could not sleep, staying in the open with no place to lay their heads;
                        with nothing to eat or drink, no bed but the bare earth, no food but the desert grasses.
                        Somehow they dragged themselves along and managed to reach Adrianople. It happened
                        that they came during the last days in that city, and were taken prisoner with the
                        rest, and in the company of Bahá’u’lláh they traveled to the Most Great Prison.

                        <a id="229512750" class="brl-location"></a>In all these straits, Áqá Faraj was the companion of Abu’l-Qásim. When, in Persian
                        Iraq, he first heard the uproar caused by the Advent of the Most Great Light, he shook
                        and trembled, clapped his hands, cried out in exultation and hastened off to Iraq.
                        Overcome with delight, he entered the presence of his holy Lord. He was gathered into
                        the loving fellowship, and blissfully received the honor of attending upon Bahá’u’lláh.
                        Then he returned, bearing glad tidings to Sulṭán-Ábád.

                        <a id="589530224" class="brl-location"></a>Here the malevolent were lying in wait, and disturbances broke out, with the result
                        that the sainted Mullá-Bá<u>sh</u>í and some other believers who had none to defend them were struck down and put to
                        death. Áqá Faraj and Abu’l-Qásim, who had gone into hiding, then hurried away to Adrianople,
                        to fall, ultimately, with the others and with their Well-Beloved, into the ‘Akká prison.

                        <a id="459782571" class="brl-location"></a>Áqá Faraj then won the honor of waiting upon the Ancient Beauty. He served the Holy
                        Threshold at all times and was a comfort to the friends. During the days of Bahá’u’lláh
                        he was His loyal servitor, and a close companion to the believers, and so it was after
                        Bahá’u’lláh’s departure: he remained true to the Covenant, and in the domain of servitude
                        he stood like a towering palm; a noble, superior man, patient in dire adversity, content
                        under all conditions.

                        her earliest youth she was beset with uncounted ordeals. First was the disaster which
                        overtook her noble father in the environs of Bada<u>sh</u>t, when, after terrible suffering, he died in a desert caravanserai, died hard—helpless

                        <a id="231210044" class="brl-location"></a>The child was left an orphan, and in distress, until, by God’s grace, she became the
                        wife of the King of Martyrs. But since he was known everywhere as a Bahá’í, was an
                        impassioned lover of Bahá’u’lláh, a man distracted, carried away, and since Náṣiri’d-Dín
                        <u>Sh</u>áh thirsted for blood—the hostile lurked in their ambush, and every day they informed
                        against him and slandered him afresh, started a new outcry and set new mischief afoot.
                        For this reason his family was never sure of his safety for a single day, but lived
                        from moment to moment in anguish, foreseeing and dreading the hour of his martyrdom.
                        Here was the family, everywhere known as Bahá’ís; their enemies, stony hearted tyrants;
                        their government inflexibly, permanently against them; their reigning Sovereign rabid
                        for blood.

                        <a id="636143840" class="brl-location"></a>It is obvious how life would be for such a household. Every day there was a new incident,
                        more turmoil, another uproar, and they could not draw a breath in peace. Then, he
                        was martyred. The Government proved brutal and savage to such a degree that the human
                        race cried out and trembled. All his possessions were stripped away and plundered,
                        and his family lacked even their daily bread.

                        Whenever she gazed on her children, she would sigh, wearing away like a candle in
                        devouring grief. But then she would thank God, and she would say: “Praised be the
                        Lord, these agonies, these broken fortunes are on Bahá’u’lláh’s account, for His dear
                        sake.” She would call to mind the defenseless family of the martyred Ḥusayn, and what
                        calamities they were privileged to bear in the pathway of God. And as she pondered
                        those events, her heart would leap up, and she would cry, “Praise be to God! We too
                        have become companions of the Prophet’s Household.”<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#807541157">2</a></sup>

                        <a id="126798002" class="brl-location"></a>Because the family was in such straits, Bahá’u’lláh directed them to come to the Most
                        Great Prison so that, sheltered in these precincts of abounding grace, they might
                        be compensated for all that had passed. Here for a time she lived, joyful, thankful,
                        and praising God. And although the son of the King of Martyrs, Mírzá ‘Abdu’l-Ḥusayn,
                        died in the prison, still his mother, Fáṭimih, accepted this, resigned herself to
                        the will of God, did not so much as sigh or cry out, and did not go into mourning.
                        Not a word did she utter to bespeak her grief.

                        <a id="961749611" class="brl-location"></a>This handmaid of God was infinitely patient, dignified and reserved, and at all times
                        thankful. But then Bahá’u’lláh left the world, and this was the supreme affliction,
                        the ultimate anguish, and she could endure no more. The shock and alarm were such
                        that like a fish taken from the water she writhed on the ground, trembled and shook
                        as if her whole being quaked, until at last she took leave of her children and she
                        died. She rose up into the shadowing mercy of God and was plunged in an ocean of light.
                        Unto her be salutations and praise, compassion and glory. May God make sweet her resting-place

                        the breast of certitude; she flourished in the cradle of faith and rejoiced in the
                        bosom of Thy love, O merciful, O compassionate Lord! And she grew to womanhood in
                        a house from which the sweet savors of oneness were spread abroad. But while she was
                        yet a girl, distress came upon her in Thy path, and misfortune assailed her, O Thou
                        the Bestower, and in her defenseless youth she drank from the cups of sorrow and pain,

                        others lay on their beds in soft repose, was she wakeful, humbly entreating Thy heavenly
                        Realm. How many a day did Thy people spend, safe in the citadel of Thy sheltering
                        care, while her heart was harried from what had come upon Thy holy ones.

                        and called out and burned in a fiery anguish for what had befallen Thy bondsmen. And

                        but this. Lowly and humble she was before each of Thy handmaids, deferring to each,
                        serving each one with her heart and soul and her whole being, out of love for Thy
                        beauty, and seeking to win Thy good pleasure. Until her house became known by Thy
                        name, and the fame of her husband was noised abroad, as one belonging to Thee, and
                        the Land of Ṣád (Iṣfahán) shook and exulted for joy, because of continual blessings
                        from this mighty champion of Thine; and the scented herbage of Thy knowledge and the
                        roses of Thy bounty began to burgeon out, and a great multitude was led to the waters
                        of Thy mercy.

                        tyranny and malice they pronounced his death; and void of justice, with harsh oppression,
                        they shed his immaculate blood. Under the glittering sword that noble personage cried
                        out to Thee: “Praised be Thou, O my God, that on the Promised Day, Thou hast helped
                        me to attain this manifest grace; that Thou hast reddened the dust with my blood,
                        spilled out upon Thy path, so that it puts forth crimson flowers. Favor and grace
                        are Thine, to grant me this gift which in all the world I longed for most. Thanks
                        be unto Thee that Thou didst succor me and confirm me and didst give me to drink of
                        this cup that was tempered at the camphor fountain<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#316760014">5</a></sup>—on the Day of Manifestation, at the hands of the cupbearer of martyrdom, in the assemblage

                        <a id="714632675" class="brl-location"></a>And after they had killed him they invaded his princely house. They attacked like
                        preying wolves, like lions at the hunt, and they sacked and plundered and pillaged,
                        seizing the rich furnishings, the ornaments and the jewels. She was in dire peril
                        then, left with the fragments of her broken heart. This violent assault took place
                        when the news of his martyrdom was spread abroad, and the children cried out as panic
                        struck at their hearts; they wailed and shed tears, and sounds of mourning rose from
                        out of that splendid home, but there was none to weep over them, there was none to
                        pity them. Rather was the night of tyranny made to deepen about them, and the fiery
                        Hell of injustice blazed out hotter than before; nor was there any torment but the
                        evil doers brought it to bear, nor any agony but they inflicted it. And this holy
                        leaf remained, she and her brood, in the grip of their oppressors, facing the malice
                        of the unmindful, with none to be their shield.

                        cries; when she was mated to anguish, and had nothing but grief for a friend. And
                        yet in these sufferings, O my Lord, she did not cease to love Thee; she did not fail
                        Thee, O my Beloved, in these fiery ordeals. Though disasters followed one upon another,

                        them all, to her they were Thy gifts and favors, and in all her massive agony—O Thou,

                        and serve Thee with all her being, all her soul and heart. She was lowly before every

                        Iṣfahán, widely celebrated as chief of the ‘ulamás in that city. When still a child
                        she lost both her parents, and was reared by her grandmother in the home of that famed
                        and learned mujtahid, and well trained in various branches of knowledge, in theology,

                        <u>Sh</u>amsu’ḍ-Ḍuḥá was there in Karbilá when the cry of the exalted Lord was raised in <u>Sh</u>íráz, and she shouted back, “Yea, verily!” As for her husband and his brother, they
                        immediately set out for <u>Sh</u>íráz; for both of them, when visiting the Shrine of Imám Ḥusayn, had looked upon the
                        beauty of the Primal Point, the Báb; both had been astonished at what they saw in
                        that transplendent face, in those heavenly attributes and ways, and had agreed that
                        One such as this must indeed be some very great being. Accordingly, the moment they
                        learned of His Divine summons, they answered: “Yea, verily!” and they burst into flame
                        with yearning love for God. Besides, they had been present every day in that holy
                        place where the late Siyyid taught, and had clearly heard him say: “The Advent is
                        nigh, the affair most subtle, most elusive. It behoves each one to search, to inquire,
                        for it may be that the Promised One is even now present among men, even now visible,
                        while all about Him are heedless, unmindful, with bandaged eyes, even as the sacred

                        <a id="923645428" class="brl-location"></a>When the two brothers arrived in Persia they heard that the Báb had gone to Mecca
                        on a pilgrimage. Siyyid Muḥammad-‘Alí therefore left for Iṣfahán and Mírzá Hádí returned
                        to Karbilá. Meanwhile <u>Sh</u>amsu’ḍ-Ḍuḥá had become friends with the “Leaf of Paradise,” sister to Mullá Ḥusayn,
                        the Bábu’l-Báb.<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#592023132">4</a></sup> Through that lady she had met Ṭáhirih, Qurratu’l-‘Ayn,<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#141713877">5</a></sup> and had begun to spend most of her time in close companionship with them both, occupied
                        in teaching the Faith. Since this was in the early days of the Cause, the people were
                        not yet afraid of it. From being with Ṭáhirih, <u>Sh</u>ams profited immeasurably, and was more on fire with the Faith than ever. She spent
                        three years in close association with Ṭáhirih in Karbilá. Day and night, she was stirred
                        like the sea by the gales of the All-Merciful, and she taught with an eloquent tongue.
                     </p>

                        <a id="613761862" class="brl-location"></a>As Ṭáhirih became celebrated throughout Karbilá, and the Cause of His Supreme Holiness,
                        the Báb, spread all over Persia, the latter-day ‘ulamás arose to deny, to heap scorn
                        upon, and to destroy it. They issued a fatvá or judgment that called for a general
                        massacre. Ṭáhirih was one of those designated by the evil ‘ulamás of the city as an
                        unbeliever, and they mistakenly thought her to be in the home of <u>Sh</u>amsu’ḍ-Ḍuḥá. They broke into <u>Sh</u>ams’s house, hemmed her in, abused and vilified her, and inflicted grievous bodily
                        harm. They dragged her out of the house and through the streets to the bázár; they
                        beat her with clubs; they stoned her, they denounced her in foul language, repeatedly
                        assaulting her. While this was going on, Ḥájí Siyyid Mihdí, the father of her distinguished
                        husband, reached the scene. “This woman is not Ṭáhirih!” he shouted at them. But he
                        had no witness to prove it,<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#072735933">6</a></sup> and the farrá<u>sh</u>es, the police and the mob would not let up. Then, through the uproar, a voice screamed
                        out: “They have arrested Qurratu’l-‘Ayn!” At this, the people abandoned <u>Sh</u>amsu’ḍ-Ḍuḥá.
                     </p>

                        <a id="048164651" class="brl-location"></a>Guards were placed at the door of Ṭáhirih’s house and no one was allowed to enter
                        or leave, while the authorities waited for instructions from Baghdad and Constantinople.
                        As the interval of waiting lengthened out, Ṭáhirih asked for permission to leave for
                        Baghdad. “Let us go there ourselves,” she told them. “We are resigned to everything.
                        Whatever happens to us is the best that can happen, and the most pleasing.” With government
                        permission, Ṭáhirih, the Leaf of Paradise, her mother and <u>Sh</u>amsu’ḍ-Ḍuḥá all left Karbilá and traveled to Baghdad, but the snakelike mass of the
                        populace followed them for some distance, stoning them from a little way off.

                        <a id="656059770" class="brl-location"></a>When they reached Baghdad they went to live at the house of <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Muḥammad-i-<u>Sh</u>ibl, the father of Muḥammad-Muṣṭafá; and since many crowded the doors there was an
                        uproar throughout that quarter, so that Ṭáhirih transferred her residence elsewhere,
                        to a lodging of her own, where she continually taught the Faith, and proclaimed the
                        Word of God. Here the ‘ulamás, <u>sh</u>ay<u>kh</u>s and others would come to listen to her, asking their questions and receiving her
                        replies, and she was soon remarkably well known throughout Baghdad, expounding as
                        she would the most recondite and subtle of theological themes.

                        <a id="171601794" class="brl-location"></a>When word of this reached the government authorities, they conveyed Ṭáhirih, <u>Sh</u>amsu’ḍ-Ḍuḥá and the Leaf to the house of the Muftí, and here they remained three months
                        until word as to their case was received from Constantinople. During Ṭáhirih’s stay
                        at the Muftí’s, much of the time was spent in conversations with him, in producing
                        convincing proofs as to the Teachings, analyzing and expounding questions relative
                        to the Lord God, discoursing on the Resurrection Day, on the Balance and the Reckoning,<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#814404591">7</a></sup> unraveling the complexities of inner truths.

                        <a id="994240213" class="brl-location"></a>One day the Muftí’s father came in and belabored them violently and at length. This
                        somewhat discomfited the Muftí and he began to apologize for his father. Then he said:
                        “Your answer has arrived from Constantinople. The Sovereign has set you free, but
                        on condition that you quit his realms.” The next morning they left the Muftí’s house
                        and proceeded to the public baths. Meanwhile <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Muḥammad-i-<u>Sh</u>ibl and <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Sulṭán-i-‘Arab made the necessary preparations for their journey, and when three
                        days had passed, they left Baghdad; that is, Ṭáhirih, <u>Sh</u>amsu’ḍ-Ḍuḥá, the Leaf of Paradise, the mother of Mírzá Hádí, and a number of Siyyids
                        from Yazd set out for Persia. Their travel expenses were all provided by <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Muḥammad.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="124364459" class="brl-location"></a>They arrived at Kirmán<u>sh</u>áh, where the women took up residence in one house, the men in another. The work of
                        teaching went on at all times, and as soon as the ‘ulamás became aware of it they
                        ordered that the party be expelled. At this the district head, with a crowd of people,
                        broke into the house and carried off their belongings; then they seated the travelers
                        in open howdahs and drove them from the city. When they came to a field, the muleteers
                        set them down on the bare ground and left, taking animals and howdahs away, leaving
                        them without food or luggage, and with no roof over their heads.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="918067442" class="brl-location"></a>Ṭáhirih thereupon wrote a letter to the Governor of Kirmán<u>sh</u>áh. “We were travelers,” she wrote, “guests in your city. ‘Honor thy guest,’ the Prophet
                        says, ‘though he be an unbeliever.’ Is it right that a guest should be thus scorned
                        and despoiled?” The Governor ordered that the stolen goods be restored, and that all
                        be returned to the owners. Accordingly the muleteers came back as well, seated the
                        travelers in the howdahs again, and they went on to Hamadán. The ladies of Hamadán,
                        even the princesses, came every day to meet with Ṭáhirih, who remained in that city
                        two months.<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#162372283">8</a></sup> There she dismissed some of her traveling companions, so that they could return to

                        <a id="193328450" class="brl-location"></a>As they journeyed, some horsemen, kinsfolk of Ṭáhirih’s, that is, her brothers, approached.
                        “We have come,” they said, “at our father’s command, to lead her away, alone.” But
                        Ṭáhirih refused, and accordingly the whole party remained together until they arrived
                        in Qazvín. Here, Ṭáhirih went to her father’s house and the friends, those who had
                        ridden and those who had traveled on foot, put up at a caravanserai. Mírzá Hádí, the
                        husband of <u>Sh</u>amsu’ḍ-Ḍuḥá, had gone to Máh-Kú, seeking out the Báb. On his return, he awaited the
                        arrival of <u>Sh</u>ams in Qazvín, after which the couple left for Iṣfahán, and when they reached there,
                        Mírzá Hádí journeyed on to Bada<u>sh</u>t. In that hamlet and its vicinity he was attacked, tormented, even stoned, and was
                        subjected to such ordeals that finally, in a ruined caravanserai, he died. His brother,
                        Mírzá Muḥammad-‘Alí, buried him there, along the roadside.

                        <u>Sh</u>amsu’ḍ-Ḍuḥá remained in Iṣfahán. She spent her days and nights in the remembrance
                        of God and in teaching His Cause to the women of that city. She was gifted with an
                        eloquent tongue; her utterance was wonderful to hear. She was highly honored by the
                        leading women of Iṣfahán, celebrated for piety, for godliness, and the purity of her
                        life. She was chastity embodied; all her hours were spent in reciting Holy Writ, or
                        expounding the Texts, or unraveling the most complex of spiritual themes, or spreading
                        abroad the sweet savors of God.

                        her or not, would come and go. For she was a fire lit by the love of God, and she
                        proclaimed the Word of God with great ardor and verve, so that she became known among
                        the non-believers as Fáṭimih, the Bahá’ís’ Lady of Light.<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#510989479">9</a></sup>

                        together and issued a decree, a fatvá, that sentenced the King of Martyrs to death.
                        They plotted as well with the Governor of the city so that among them they could sack
                        and plunder and carry off all that vast treasure he possessed. Then the <u>Sh</u>áh joined forces with those two wild animals; and he commanded that the blood of both
                        brothers, the King of Martyrs and the Beloved of Martyrs, be spilled out. Without
                        warning, those ruthless men—the She-Serpent, the Wolf, and their brutal farrá<u>sh</u>es and constabulary—attacked; they chained the two brothers and led them off to prison,
                        looted their richly furnished houses, wrested away all their possessions, and spared
                        no one, not even infants at the breast. They tortured, cursed, reviled, mocked, beat
                        the kin and others of the victims’ household, and would not stay their hands.

                        <a id="707672208" class="brl-location"></a>In Paris, Ẓillu’s-Sulṭán<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#478964197">10</a></sup> related the following, swearing to the truth of it upon his oath: “Many and many
                        a time I warned those two great scions of the Prophet’s House, but all to no avail.
                        At the last I summoned them one night, and with extreme urgency I told them in so
                        many words: ‘Gentlemen, the <u>Sh</u>áh has three times condemned you to death. His farmáns keep on coming. The decree
                        is absolute and there is only one course open to you now: you must, in the presence
                        of the ‘ulamás, clear yourselves and curse your Faith.’ Their answer was: ‘Yá Bahá’u’l-Abhá!
                        O Thou Glory of the All-Glorious! May our lives be offered up!’ Finally I agreed to
                        their not cursing their Faith. I told them all they had to say was, ‘We are not Bahá’ís.’
                        ‘Just those few words,’ I said, ‘will be enough; then I can write out my report for
                        the <u>Sh</u>áh, and you will be saved.’ ‘That is impossible,’ they answered, ‘because we are Bahá’ís.
                        O Thou Glory of the All-Glorious, our hearts hunger for martyrdom! Yá Bahá’u’l-Abhá!’
                        I was enraged, then, and I tried, by being harsh with them, to force them to renounce
                        their Faith, but it was hopeless. The decree of the rapacious She-Serpent and Wolf,
                        and the <u>Sh</u>áh’s commands, were carried out.”
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="306248670" class="brl-location"></a>After those two were martyred, <u>Sh</u>amsu’ḍ-Ḍuḥá was hunted down, and had to seek a refuge in her brother’s house. Although
                        he was not a believer, he was known in Iṣfahán as an upright, pious and godly man,
                        a man of learning, an ascetic who, hermit-like, kept to himself, and for these reasons
                        he was highly regarded and trusted by all. She stayed there with him, but the Government
                        did not abandon its search, finally discovered her whereabouts and summoned her to
                        appear; the evil ‘ulamás had a hand in this, joining forces with the civil authorities.
                        Her brother was therefore obliged to accompany <u>Sh</u>amsu’ḍ-Ḍuḥá to the Governor’s house. He remained without, while they sent his sister
                        into the women’s apartments; the Governor came there, to the door, and he kicked and
                        trampled her so savagely that she fainted away. Then the Governor shouted to his wife:
                        “Princess! Princess! Come here and take a look at the Bahá’ís’ Lady of Light!”
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="865462895" class="brl-location"></a>The women lifted her up and put her in one of the rooms. Meanwhile her brother, dumbfounded,
                        was waiting outside the mansion. Finally, trying to plead with him, he said to the
                        Governor: “This sister of mine has been beaten so severely that she is at the point
                        of death. What is the use of keeping her here? There is no hope for her now. With
                        your permission I can get her back to my house. It would be better to have her die
                        there, rather than here, for after all, she is a descendant of the Prophet, she is
                        of Muḥammad’s noble line, and she has done no wrong. There is nothing against her
                        except her kinship to the son-in-law.” The Governor answered: “She is one of the great
                        leaders and heroines of the Bahá’ís. She will simply cause another uproar.” The brother
                        said: “I promise you that she will not utter a word. It is certain that within a few
                        days she will not even be alive. Her body is frail, weak, almost lifeless, and she
                        has suffered terrible harm.”
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="974034579" class="brl-location"></a>Since the brother was greatly respected and trusted by high and low alike, the Governor
                        released <u>Sh</u>amsu’ḍ-Ḍuḥá in his custody, letting her go. She lived for a while in his house, crying
                        out, grieving, shedding her tears, mourning her dead. Neither was the brother at peace,
                        nor would the hostile leave them alone; there was some new turmoil every day, and
                        public clamor. The brother finally thought it best to take <u>Sh</u>ams away on a pilgrimage to Ma<u>sh</u>had, hoping that the fire of civil disturbances would die down.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="397046016" class="brl-location"></a>They went to Ma<u>sh</u>had and settled in a vacant house near the Shrine of the Imám Riḍá.<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#913888091">11</a></sup>
                        
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="906591330" class="brl-location"></a>Because he was such a pious man the brother would leave every morning to visit the
                        Shrine, and there he would stay, busy with his devotions until almost noon. In the
                        afternoon as well, he would hasten away to the Holy Place, and pray until evening.
                        The house being empty, <u>Sh</u>amsu’ḍ-Ḍuḥá managed to get in touch with various women believers and began to associate
                        with them; and because the love of God burned so brightly in her heart she was unable
                        to keep silent, so that during those hours when her brother was absent the place came
                        alive. The Bahá’í women would flock there and absorb her lucid and eloquent speech.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="051853091" class="brl-location"></a>In those days life in Ma<u>sh</u>had was hard for the believers, with the malevolent always on the alert; if they so
                        much as suspected an individual, they murdered him. There was no security of any kind,
                        no peace. But <u>Sh</u>amsu’ḍ-Ḍuḥá could not help herself: in spite of all the terrible ordeals she had endured,
                        she ignored the danger, and was capable of flinging herself into flames, or into the
                        sea. Since her brother frequented no one, he knew nothing of what was going on. Day
                        and night he would only leave the house for the Shrine, the Shrine for the house;
                        he was a recluse, had no friends, and would not so much as speak to another person.
                        Nevertheless there came a day when he saw that trouble had broken out in the city,
                        and he knew it would end in serious harm. He was a man so calm and silent that he
                        did not reproach his sister; he simply took her away from Ma<u>sh</u>had without warning, and they returned to Iṣfahán. Here, he sent her to her daughter,
                        the widow of the King of Martyrs, for he would no longer shelter her under his roof.
                     </p>

                        <a id="762663360" class="brl-location"></a>
                        <u>Sh</u>amsu’ḍ-Ḍuḥá was thus back in Iṣfahán, boldly teaching the Faith and spreading abroad
                        the sweet savors of God. So vehement was the fiery love in her heart that it compelled
                        her to speak out, whenever she found a listening ear. And when it was observed that
                        once again the household of the King of Martyrs was about to be overtaken by calamities,
                        and that they were enduring severe afflictions there in Iṣfahán, Bahá’u’lláh desired
                        them to come to the Most Great Prison. <u>Sh</u>amsu’ḍ-Ḍuḥá, with the widow of the King of Martyrs and the children, arrived in the
                        Holy Land. Here they were joyously spending their days when the son of the King of
                        Martyrs, Mírzá ‘Abdu’l-Ḥusayn, as a result of the awful suffering he had been subjected
                        to in Iṣfahán, came down with tuberculosis and died in ‘Akká.

                        <a id="083370272" class="brl-location"></a>
                        <u>Sh</u>amsu’ḍ-Ḍuḥá was heavy of heart. She mourned his absence, she wasted away with longing
                        for him, and it was all much harder because then the Supreme Affliction came upon
                        us, the crowning anguish. The basis of her life was undermined; candle-like, she was
                        consumed with grieving. She grew so feeble that she took to her bed, unable to move.
                        Still, she did not rest, nor keep silent for a moment. She would tell of days long
                        gone, of things that had come to pass in the Cause, or she would recite from Holy
                        Writ, or she would supplicate, and chant her prayers—until, out of the Most Great
                        Prison, she soared away to the world of God. She hastened away from this dust gulf
                        of perdition to an unsullied country; packed her gear and journeyed to the land of
                        lights. Unto her be salutations and praise, and most great mercy, sheltered in the
                        compassion of her omnipotent Lord.

                        Qazvín, and her paternal uncle was Mullá Taqí, the Imám-Jum‘ih or leader of prayers
                        in the cathedral mosque of that city. They married her to Mullá Muḥammad, the son
                        of Mullá Taqí, and she gave birth to three children, two sons and a daughter; all
                        three were bereft of the grace that encompassed their mother, and all failed to recognize

                        Such was the degree of her scholarship and attainments that her father would often
                        express his regret, saying, “Would that she had been a boy, for he would have shed
                        illumination upon my household, and would have succeeded me!”<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#408108868">2</a></sup>

                        <a id="599881163" class="brl-location"></a>One day she was a guest in the home of Mullá Javád, a cousin on her mother’s side,
                        and there in her cousin’s library she came upon some of the writings of <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Aḥmad-i-Aḥsá’í.<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#386928237">3</a></sup> Delighted with what he had to say, Ṭáhirih asked to borrow the writings and take
                        them home. Mullá Javád violently objected, telling her: “Your father is an enemy of
                        the Twin Luminous Lights, <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Aḥmad and Siyyid Káẓim. If he should even dream that any words of those two great
                        beings, any fragrance from the garden of those realities, had come your way, he would
                        make an attempt against my life, and you too would become the target of his wrath.”
                        Ṭáhirih answered: “For a long time now, I have thirsted after this; I have yearned
                        for these explanations, these inner truths. Give me whatever you have of these books.
                        Never mind if it angers my father.” Accordingly, Mullá Javád sent over the writings
                        of the <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> and the Siyyid.

The very moment he learned that his daughter knew of the <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u>í doctrines, Mullá Ṣáliḥ’s denunciations rang out, and he cried: “Javád has made you
                        a lost soul!” Ṭáhirih answered, “The late <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> was a true scholar of God, and I have learned an infinity of spiritual truths from
                        reading his books. Furthermore, he bases whatever he says on the traditions of the
                        Holy Imáms. You call yourself a mystic knower and a man of God, you consider your
                        respected uncle to be a scholar as well, and most pious—yet in neither of you do I
                        find a trace of those qualities!”

                        <a id="739439815" class="brl-location"></a>For some time, she carried on heated discussions with her father, debating such questions
                        as the Resurrection and the Day of Judgment, the Night-Ascent of Muḥammad to Heaven,
                        the Promise and the Threat, and the Advent of the Promised One.<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#918652643">4</a></sup> Lacking arguments, her father would resort to curses and abuse. Then one night, in
                        support of her contention, Ṭáhirih quoted a holy tradition from the Imám Ja‘far-i-Ṣádiq;<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#971327708">5</a></sup> and since it confirmed what she was saying, her father burst out laughing, mocking
                        the tradition. Ṭáhirih said, “Oh my father, these are the words of the Holy Imám.
                        How can you mock and deny them?”
                     </p>

                        <a id="596619044" class="brl-location"></a>From that time on, she ceased to debate and contend with her father. Meanwhile she
                        entered into secret correspondence with Siyyid Káẓim, regarding the solution of complex
                        theological problems, and thus it came about that the Siyyid conferred on her the
                        name “Solace of the Eyes” (Qurratu’l-‘Ayn); as for the title Ṭáhirih (“The Pure One”),
                        it was first associated with her in Bada<u>sh</u>t, and was subsequently approved by the Báb, and recorded in Tablets.

                        <a id="214448286" class="brl-location"></a>Ṭáhirih had caught fire. She set out for Karbilá, hoping to meet Siyyid Káẓim, but
                        she arrived too late: ten days before she reached that city, he passed away. Not long
                        before his death the Siyyid had shared with his disciples the good news that the promised
                        Advent was at hand. “Go forth,” he repeatedly told them, “and seek out your Lord.”
                        Thus the most distinguished of his followers gathered for retirement and prayer, for
                        fasts and vigils, in the Masjid-i-Kúfih, while some awaited the Advent in Karbilá.
                        Among these was Ṭáhirih, fasting by day, practicing religious disciplines, and spending
                        the night in vigils, and chanting prayers. One night when it was getting along toward
                        dawn she laid her head on her pillow, lost all awareness of this earthly life, and
                        dreamed a dream; in her vision a youth, a Siyyid, wearing a black cloak and a green
                        turban, appeared to her in the heavens; he was standing in the air, reciting verses
                        and praying with his hands upraised. At once, she memorized one of those verses, and
                        wrote it down in her notebook when she awoke. After the Báb had declared His mission,
                        and His first book, “The Best of Stories,”<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#114202064">6</a></sup> was circulated, Ṭáhirih was reading a section of the text one day, and she came upon
                        that same verse, which she had noted down from the dream. Instantly offering thanks,
                        she fell to her knees and bowed her forehead to the ground, convinced that the Báb’s
                        message was truth.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="220017597" class="brl-location"></a>This good news reached her in Karbilá and she at once began to teach. She translated
                        and expounded “The Best of Stories,” also writing in Persian and Arabic, composing
                        odes and lyrics, and humbly practicing her devotions, performing even those that were
                        optional and supernumerary. When the evil ‘ulamás in Karbilá got wind of all this,
                        and learned that a woman was summoning the people to a new religion and had already
                        influenced a considerable number, they went to the Governor and lodged a complaint.
                        Their charges, to be brief, led to violent attacks on Ṭáhirih, and sufferings, which
                        she accepted and for which she offered praise and thanks. When the authorities came
                        hunting for her they first assaulted <u>Sh</u>amsu’ḍ-Ḍuḥá, mistaking her for Ṭáhirih. As soon, however, as they heard that Ṭáhirih
                        had been arrested they let <u>Sh</u>ams go—for Ṭáhirih had sent a message to the Governor saying, “I am at your disposal.
                        Do not harm any other.”
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="843022036" class="brl-location"></a>The Governor set guards over her house and shut her away, writing Baghdad for instructions
                        as to how he should proceed. For three months, she lived in a state of siege, completely
                        isolated, with the guards surrounding her house. Since the local authorities had still
                        received no reply from Baghdad, Ṭáhirih referred her case to the Governor, saying:
                        “No word has come from either Baghdad or Constantinople. Accordingly, we will ourselves
                        proceed to Baghdad and await the answer there.” The Governor gave her leave to go,
                        and she set out, accompanied by <u>Sh</u>amsu’ḍ-Ḍuḥá and the Leaf of Paradise (the sister of Mullá Ḥusayn) and her mother.
                        In Baghdad she stayed first in the house of <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Muḥammad, the distinguished father of Áqá Muḥammad-Muṣṭafá. But so great was the
                        press of people around her that she transferred her residence to another quarter,
                        engaged night and day in spreading the Faith, and freely associated with the inhabitants
                        of Baghdad. She thus became celebrated throughout the city and there was a great uproar.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="232401698" class="brl-location"></a>Ṭáhirih also maintained a correspondence with the ‘ulamás of Káẓimayn; she presented
                        them with unanswerable proofs, and when one or another appeared before her she offered
                        him convincing arguments. Finally she sent a message to the <u>Sh</u>í‘ih divines, saying to them: “If you are not satisfied with these conclusive proofs,
                        I challenge you to a trial by ordeal.”<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#399176549">7</a></sup> Then there was a great outcry from the divines, and the Governor was obliged to send
                        Ṭáhirih and her women companions to the house of Ibn-i-Álúsí, who was muftí of Baghdad.
                        Here she remained about three months, waiting for word and directions from Constantinople.
                        Ibn-i-Álúsí would engage her in learned dialogues, questions would be asked and answers
                        given, and he would not deny what she had to say.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="560337713" class="brl-location"></a>On a certain day the muftí related one of his dreams, and asked her to tell him what
                        it meant. He said: “In my dream I saw the <u>Sh</u>í‘ih ‘ulamás arriving at the holy tomb of Imám Ḥusayn, the Prince of Martyrs. They
                        took away the barrier that encloses the tomb, and they broke open the resplendent
                        grave, so that the immaculate body lay revealed to their gaze. They sought to take
                        up the holy form, but I cast myself down on the corpse and I warded them off.” Ṭáhirih
                        answered: “This is the meaning of your dream: you are about to deliver me from the
                        hands of the <u>Sh</u>í‘ih divines.” “I too had interpreted it thus,” said Ibn-i-Álúsí.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="387548892" class="brl-location"></a>Since he had discovered that she was well versed in learned questions and in sacred
                        commentaries and Texts, the two often carried on debates; she would speak on such
                        themes as the Day of Resurrection, the Balance, and the Ṣiráṭ,<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#037720949">8</a></sup> and he would not turn away.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="519925255" class="brl-location"></a>Then came a night when the father of Ibn-i-Álúsí called at the house of his son. He
                        had a meeting with Ṭáhirih and abruptly, without asking a single question, began to
                        curse, mock and revile her. Embarrassed at his father’s behavior, Ibn-i-Álúsí apologized.
                        Then he said: “The answer has come from Constantinople. The King has commanded that
                        you be set free, but only on condition that you leave his realms. Go then, tomorrow,
                        make your preparations for the journey, and hasten away from this land.”
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="087616916" class="brl-location"></a>Accordingly Ṭáhirih, with her women companions, left the muftí’s house, saw to arranging
                        for their travel gear, and went out of Baghdad. When they left the city, a number
                        of Arab believers, carrying arms, walked along beside their convoy. Among the escort
                        were <u>Sh</u>a<u>yk</u>h Sulṭán, <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Muḥammad and his distinguished son Muḥammad-Muṣṭafá, and <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Ṣáliḥ, and these were mounted. It was <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Muḥammad who defrayed the expenses of the journey.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="617635641" class="brl-location"></a>When they reached Kirmán<u>sh</u>áh the women alighted at one house, the men at another, and the inhabitants arrived
                        in a continuous stream to seek information as to the new Faith. Here as elsewhere
                        the ‘ulamás were soon in a state of frenzy and they commanded that the newcomers be
                        expelled. As a result the kad-<u>kh</u>udá or chief officer of that quarter, with a band of people, laid siege to the house
                        where Ṭáhirih was, and sacked it. Then they placed Ṭáhirih and her companions in an
                        uncovered howdah and carried them from the town to an open field, where they put the
                        captives out. The drivers then took their animals and returned to the city. The victims
                        were left on the bare ground, with no food, no shelter, and no means of traveling
                        on.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="102615567" class="brl-location"></a>Ṭáhirih at once wrote a letter to the prince of that territory, in which she told
                        him: “O thou just Governor! We were guests in your city. Is this the way you treat
                        your guests?” When her letter was brought to the Governor of Kirmán<u>sh</u>áh he said: “I knew nothing of this injustice. This mischief was kindled by the divines.”
                        He immediately commanded the kad-<u>kh</u>udá to return all the travelers’ belongings. That official duly surrendered the stolen
                        goods, the drivers with their animals came back out of the city, the travelers took
                        their places and resumed the journey.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="675211046" class="brl-location"></a>They arrived in Hamadán and here their stay was a happy one. The most illustrious
                        ladies of that city, even the princesses, would come to visit, seeking the benefits
                        of Ṭáhirih’s teaching. In Hamadán she dismissed a part of her escort and sent them
                        back to Baghdad, while she brought some of them, including <u>Sh</u>amsu’ḍ-Ḍuḥá and <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u>-Ṣáliḥ, along with her to Qazvín.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="127040571" class="brl-location"></a>As they traveled, some riders advanced to meet them, kinsmen of Ṭáhirih’s from Qazvín,
                        and they wished to lead her away alone, unescorted by the others, to her father’s
                        house. Ṭáhirih refused, saying: “These are in my company.” In this way they entered
                        Qazvín. Ṭáhirih proceeded to her father’s house, while the Arabs who had formed her
                        escort alighted at a caravanserai. Ṭáhirih soon left her father and went to live with
                        her brother, and there the great ladies of the city would come to visit her; all this
                        until the murder of Mullá Taqí,<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#587240086">9</a></sup> when every Bábí in Qazvín was taken prisoner. Some were sent to Ṭihrán and then returned
                        to Qazvín and martyred.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="154233617" class="brl-location"></a>Mullá Taqí’s murder came about in this way: One day, when that besotted tyrant had
                        mounted his pulpit, he began to mock and revile the great <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Aḥmad-i-Aḥsá’í. Shamelessly, grossly, screaming obscenities, he cried out: “That
                        <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> is the one who has kindled this fire of evil, and subjected the whole world to this
                        ordeal!” There was an inquirer in the audience, a native of <u>Sh</u>íráz. He found the taunts, jeers and indecencies to be more than he could bear. Under
                        cover of darkness he betook himself to the mosque, plunged a spearhead between the
                        lips of Mullá Taqí and fled. The next morning they arrested the defenseless believers
                        and thereupon subjected them to agonizing torture, though all were innocent and knew
                        nothing of what had come to pass. There was never any question of investigating the
                        case; the believers repeatedly declared their innocence but no one paid them any heed.
                        When a few days had passed the killer gave himself up; he confessed to the authorities,
                        informing them that he had committed the murder because Mullá Taqí had vilified <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Aḥmad. “I deliver myself into your hands,” he told them, “so that you will set these
                        innocent people free.” They arrested him as well, put him in the stocks, chained him,
                        and sent him in chains, along with the others, to Ṭihrán.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="424379370" class="brl-location"></a>Once there he observed that despite his confession, the others were not released.
                        By night, he made his escape from the prison and went to the house of Riḍá <u>Kh</u>án—that rare and precious man, that star-sacrifice among the lovers of God—the son
                        of Muḥammad <u>Kh</u>án, Master of the Horse to Muḥammad <u>Sh</u>áh. He stayed there for a time, after which he and Riḍá <u>Kh</u>án secretly rode away to the Fort of <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Ṭabarsí in Mázindarán.<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#066761521">10</a></sup> Muḥammad <u>Kh</u>án sent riders after them to track them down, but try as they might, no one could
                        find them. Those two horsemen got to the Fort of Ṭabarsí, where both of them won a
                        martyr’s death. As for the other friends who were in the prison at Ṭihrán, some of
                        these were returned to Qazvín and they too suffered martyrdom.
                     </p>

                        <a id="852385317" class="brl-location"></a>One day the administrator of finance, Mírzá <u>Sh</u>afí‘, called in the murderer and addressed him, saying: “Jináb, do you belong to a
                        dervish order, or do you follow the Law? If you are a follower of the Law, why did
                        you deal that learned mujtahid a cruel, a fatal blow in the mouth? If you are a dervish
                        and follow the Path, one of the rules of the Path is to harm no man. How, then, could
                        you slaughter that zealous divine?” “Sir,” he replied, “besides the Law, and besides
                        the Path, we also have the Truth. It was in serving the Truth that I paid him for
                        his deed.”<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#760085901">11</a></sup>

                        <a id="318249106" class="brl-location"></a>These things would take place before the reality of this Cause was revealed and all
                        was made plain. For in those days no one knew that the Manifestation of the Báb would
                        culminate in the Manifestation of the Blessed Beauty and that the law of retaliation
                        would be done away with, and the foundation-principle of the Law of God would be this,
                        that “It is better for you to be killed than to kill”; that discord and contention
                        would cease, and the rule of war and butchery would fall away. In those days, that
                        sort of thing would happen. But praised be God, with the advent of the Blessed Beauty
                        such a splendor of harmony and peace shone forth, such a spirit of meekness and long-suffering,
                        that when in Yazd men, women and children were made the targets of enemy fire or were
                        put to the sword, when the leaders and the evil ‘ulamás and their followers joined
                        together and unitedly assaulted those defenseless victims and spilled out their blood—hacking
                        at and rending apart the bodies of chaste women, with their daggers slashing the throats
                        of children they had orphaned, then setting the torn and mangled limbs on fire—not
                        one of the friends of God lifted a hand against them. Indeed, among those martyrs,
                        those real companions of the ones who died, long gone, at Karbilá, was a man who,
                        when he saw the drawn sword flashing over him, thrust sugar candy into his murderer’s
                        mouth and cried, “With a sweet taste on your lips, put me to death—for you bring me
                        martyrdom, my dearest wish!”
                     </p>

                        <a id="573388339" class="brl-location"></a>Let us return to our theme. After the murder of her impious uncle, Mullá Taqí, in
                        Qazvín, Ṭáhirih fell into dire straits. She was a prisoner and heavy of heart, grieving
                        over the painful events that had come to pass. She was watched on every side, by attendants,
                        guards, the farrá<u>sh</u>es, and her foes. While she languished thus, Bahá’u’lláh dispatched Hádíy-i-Qazvíní,
                        husband of the celebrated <u>Kh</u>átún-Ján, from the capital, and they managed, by a stratagem, to free her from that
                        embroilment and got her to Ṭihrán in the night. She alighted at the mansion of Bahá’u’lláh
                        and was lodged in an upper apartment.
                     </p>

                        <a id="237708175" class="brl-location"></a>When word of this spread throughout Ṭihrán, the Government hunted for her high and
                        low; nevertheless, the friends kept arriving to see her, in a steady stream, and Ṭáhirih,
                        seated behind a curtain, would converse with them. One day the great Siyyid Yaḥyá,
                        surnamed Vaḥíd, was present there. As he sat without, Ṭáhirih listened to him from
                        behind the veil. I was then a child, and was sitting on her lap. With eloquence and
                        fervor, Vaḥíd was discoursing on the signs and verses that bore witness to the advent
                        of the new Manifestation. She suddenly interrupted him and, raising her voice, vehemently
                        declared: “O Yaḥyá! Let deeds, not words, testify to thy faith, if thou art a man
                        of true learning. Cease idly repeating the traditions of the past, for the day of
                        service, of steadfast action, is come. Now is the time to show forth the true signs
                        of God, to rend asunder the veils of idle fancy, to promote the Word of God, and to
                        sacrifice ourselves in His path. Let deeds, not words, be our adorning!”
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="182936719" class="brl-location"></a>The Blessed Beauty made elaborate arrangements for Ṭáhirih’s journey to Bada<u>sh</u>t and sent her off with an equipage and retinue. His own party left for that region
                        some days afterward.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="635613419" class="brl-location"></a>In Bada<u>sh</u>t, there was a great open field. Through its center a stream flowed, and to its right,
                        left, and rear there were three gardens, the envy of Paradise. One of those gardens
                        was assigned to Quddús,<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#843601235">12</a></sup> but this was kept a secret. Another was set apart for Ṭáhirih, and in a third was
                        raised the pavilion of Bahá’u’lláh. On the field amidst the three gardens, the believers
                        pitched their tents. Evenings, Bahá’u’lláh, Quddús and Ṭáhirih would come together.
                        In those days the fact that the Báb was the Qá’im had not yet been proclaimed; it
                        was the Blessed Beauty, with Quddús, Who arranged for the proclamation of a universal
                        Advent and the abrogation and repudiation of the ancient laws.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="753376363" class="brl-location"></a>Then one day, and there was a wisdom in it, Bahá’u’lláh fell ill; that is, the indisposition
                        was to serve a vital purpose. On a sudden, in the sight of all, Quddús came out of
                        his garden, and entered the pavilion of Bahá’u’lláh. But Ṭáhirih sent him a message,
                        to say that their Host being ill, Quddús should visit her garden instead. His answer
                        was: “This garden is preferable. Come, then, to this one.” Ṭáhirih, with her face
                        unveiled, stepped from her garden, advancing to the pavilion of Bahá’u’lláh; and as
                        she came, she shouted aloud these words: “The Trumpet is sounding! The great Trump
                        is blown! The universal Advent is now proclaimed!”<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#257069533">13</a></sup> The believers gathered in that tent were panic struck, and each one asked himself,
                        “How can the Law be abrogated? How is it that this woman stands here without her veil?”
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="217954975" class="brl-location"></a>“Read the Súrih of the Inevitable,”<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#876943671">14</a></sup> said Bahá’u’lláh; and the reader began: “When the Day that must come shall have come
                        suddenly… Day that shall abase! Day that shall exalt!…” and thus was the new Dispensation
                        announced and the great Resurrection made manifest. At the start, those who were present
                        fled away, and some forsook their Faith, while some fell a prey to suspicion and doubt,
                        and a number, after wavering, returned to the presence of Bahá’u’lláh. The Conference
                        of Bada<u>sh</u>t broke up, but the universal Advent had been proclaimed.
                     </p>

                        <a id="127405427" class="brl-location"></a>Afterward, Quddús hastened away to the Fort of Ṭabarsí<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#343739233">15</a></sup> and the Blessed Beauty, with provisions and equipment, journeyed to Níyálá, having
                        the intention of going on from there by night, making His way through the enemy encampment
                        and entering the Fort. But Mírzá Taqí, the Governor of Ámul, got word of this, and
                        with seven hundred riflemen arrived in Níyálá. Surrounding the village by night, he
                        sent Bahá’u’lláh with eleven riders back to Ámul, and those calamities and tribulations,
                        told of before, came to pass.
                     </p>

                        <a id="213485345" class="brl-location"></a>As for Ṭáhirih, after the breakup at Bada<u>sh</u>t she was captured, and the oppressors sent her back under guard to Ṭihrán. There
                        she was imprisoned in the house of Maḥmúd <u>Kh</u>án, the Kalántar. But she was aflame, enamored, restless, and could not be still.
                        The ladies of Ṭihrán, on one pretext or another, crowded to see and listen to her.
                        It happened that there was a celebration at the Mayor’s house for the marriage of
                        his son; a nuptial banquet was prepared, and the house adorned. The flower of Ṭihrán’s
                        ladies were invited, the princesses, the wives of vazírs and other great. A splendid
                        wedding it was, with instrumental music and vocal melodies—by day and night the lute,
                        the bells and songs. Then Ṭáhirih began to speak; and so bewitched were the great
                        ladies that they forsook the cithern and the drum and all the pleasures of the wedding
                        feast, to crowd about Ṭáhirih and listen to the sweet words of her mouth.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="209505202" class="brl-location"></a>Thus she remained, a helpless captive. Then came the attempt on the life of the <u>Sh</u>áh;<sup class="brl-note brl-footnote"><a href="#558620473">16</a></sup> a farmán was issued; she was sentenced to death. Saying she was summoned to the Prime
                        Minister’s, they arrived to lead her away from the Kalántar’s house. She bathed her
                        face and hands, arrayed herself in a costly dress, and scented with attar of roses
                        she came out of the house.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a id="324534323" class="brl-location"></a>They brought her into a garden, where the headsmen waited; but these wavered and then
                        refused to end her life. A slave was found, far gone in drunkenness; besotted, vicious,
                        black of heart. And he strangled Ṭáhirih. He forced a scarf between her lips and rammed
                        it down her throat. Then they lifted up her unsullied body and flung it in a well,
                        there in the garden, and over it threw down earth and stones. But Ṭáhirih rejoiced;
                        she had heard with a light heart the tidings of her martyrdom; she set her eyes on
                        the supernal Kingdom and offered up her life.

                                       for security reasons, made the ostensible leader. Following His declaration in 1863
                                       as the Promised One of the Báb, Bahá’u’lláh withdrew for a time, in Adrianople, to
                                       allow the exiles a free choice as between Him and this unworthy half brother, whose
                                       crimes and follies had threatened to destroy the infant Faith. Terrified at being
                                       challenged to face Bahá’u’lláh in a public debate, Mírzá Yaḥyá refused, and was completely
                                       discredited. As Bahá’í history has repeatedly demonstrated, this crisis too, however
                                       grievous, resulted in still greater victories for the Faith—including the rallying
                                       of prominent disciples to Bahá’u’lláh, and the global proclamation of Bahá’u’lláh’s
                                       mission, in His Tablets to the Pope and Kings. Cf. <span class="brl-italic">God Passes By</span>, Chapter II, paragraph beginning “A successor or viceregent the Báb had never named…”,
