                     <a id="509004221" class="brl-location"></a>The years following Bahá’u’lláh’s arrival in Adrianople witnessed His Revelation’s
                     attainment, in the words of Shoghi Effendi, of “its meridian glory” through the proclamation
                     of its Founder’s message to the kings and rulers of the world. During this relatively
                     brief but turbulent period of the Faith’s history, and in the early years of His subsequent
                     exile in 1868 to the fortress town of ‘Akká, He summoned the monarchs of East and
                     West collectively, and some among them individually, to recognize the Day of God and
                     to acknowledge the One promised in the scriptures of the religions professed by the
                     recipients of His summons. “Never since the beginning of the world,” Bahá’u’lláh declares,
                     “hath the Message been so openly proclaimed.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <a id="627231967" class="brl-location"></a>The present volume brings together the first full, authorized English translation
                     of these major writings. Among them is the complete Súriy-i-Haykal, the Súrih of the
                     Temple, one of Bahá’u’lláh’s most challenging works. It was originally revealed during
                     His banishment to Adrianople and later recast after His arrival in ‘Akká. In this
                     version He incorporated His messages addressed to individual potentates—Pope Pius
                     IX, Napoleon III, Czar Alexander II, Queen Victoria, and Náṣiri’d-Dín <u>Sh</u>áh.

                     <a id="453128172" class="brl-location"></a>It was this composite work which, shortly after its completion, Bahá’u’lláh instructed
                     be written in the form of a pentacle, symbolizing the human temple. To it He added,
                     as a conclusion, what Shoghi Effendi has described as “words which reveal the importance
                     He attached to those Messages, and indicate their direct association with the prophecies
                     of the Old Testament”:

                     <a id="872790908" class="brl-location"></a>During the last years of His ministry Bahá’u’lláh Himself arranged for the publication
                     for the first time of definitive versions of some of His principal works, and the
                     Súriy-i-Haykal was awarded a prominent position among them.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <a id="377442935" class="brl-location"></a>Of the various writings that make up the Súriy-i-Haykal, one requires particular mention.
                     The Lawḥ-i-Sulṭán, the Tablet to Náṣiri’d-Dín <u>Sh</u>áh, Bahá’u’lláh’s lengthiest epistle to any single sovereign, was revealed in the
                     weeks immediately preceding His final banishment to ‘Akká. It was eventually delivered
                     to the monarch by Badí‘, a youth of seventeen, who had entreated Bahá’u’lláh for the
                     honor of rendering some service. His efforts won him the crown of martyrdom and immortalized
                     his name. The Tablet contains the celebrated passage describing the circumstances
                     in which the divine call was communicated to Bahá’u’lláh and the effect it produced.
                     Here, too, we find His unequivocal offer to meet with the Muslim clergy, in the presence
                     of the <u>Sh</u>áh, and to provide whatever proofs of the new Revelation they might consider to be
                     definitive, a test of spiritual integrity significantly failed by those who claimed
                     to be the authoritative trustees of the message of the Qur’án.

                     <a id="891474790" class="brl-location"></a>Included in this collection, as well, is the first full translation of the Súriy-i-Mulúk
                     or Súrih of the Kings, which Shoghi Effendi described as “the most momentous Tablet
                     revealed by Bahá’u’lláh in which He, for the first time, directs His words collectively
                     to the entire company of the monarchs of East and West.” It sets forth both the character
                     of His mission and the standard of justice that must govern the exercise of their
                     rule in this Day of God:

                     <a id="990320254" class="brl-location"></a>The Tablet introduces some of the great themes that were to figure prominently in
                     the Writings of Bahá’u’lláh over the next two and a half decades: the obligation of
                     those into whose hands God has entrusted civil authority to institute the reign of
                     justice, the necessity for the reduction of armaments and the resolution of conflicts
                     among nations, and an end to the excessive expenditures that were impoverishing these
                     rulers’ subjects.

                     of the world, Shoghi Effendi has written:

                        within the purview of the Author of these Messages, and receive, each according to
                        their merits, the counsels and admonitions they deserve. No less amazing is the diversity
                        of the subjects touched upon in these Tablets. The transcendent majesty and unity
                        of an unknowable and unapproachable God is extolled, and the oneness of His Messengers
                        proclaimed and emphasized. The uniqueness, the universality and potentialities of
                        the Bahá’í Faith are stressed, and the purpose and character of the Bábí Revelation
                        unfolded.

                        the prosperity and the unity of the human race, enjoined. Kings are censured, ecclesiastical

                        of His advent with the coming of the Father Himself unequivocally admitted and repeatedly

                     <a id="417323056" class="brl-location"></a>In a Tablet, the original of which has been lost, Bahá’u’lláh had already condemned,
                     in the severest terms, the misrule of the Ottoman Sulṭán ‘Abdu’l-‘Azíz. The present
                     volume includes, however, three other Tablets which address two ministers of the Sulṭán,
                     whose selfish and unprincipled influence played an important role in Bahá’u’lláh’s
                     successive banishments. The Súriy-i-Ra’ís, which addresses ‘Álí Pá<u>sh</u>á, the Ottoman Prime Minister, was revealed in August 1868 as the exiles were being
                     moved from Adrianople to Gallipoli, and exposes unsparingly the abuse of civil power
                     the minister had perpetrated. The Lawḥ-i-Ra’ís, which also contains passages directed
                     to ‘Álí Pá<u>sh</u>á, was revealed shortly after Bahá’u’lláh’s incarceration in the citadel of ‘Akká
                     and includes a chilling denunciation of the character of the minister. The third Tablet,
                     the Lawḥ-i-Fu’ád, revealed in 1869 shortly after the death of Fu’ád Pá<u>sh</u>á, the Ottoman minister to whose machinations it refers, describes the spiritual consequences
                     of the abuse of power, and foretells the imminent downfall of his colleague, ‘Álí
                     Pá<u>sh</u>á, and the overthrow of the Sulṭán himself—prophecies that were widely circulated
                     and whose dramatic fulfillment added greatly to the prestige of their Author.

                     <a id="968607158" class="brl-location"></a>It seems especially appropriate, as Bahá’u’lláh’s influence penetrates ever more deeply
                     the life of the larger society throughout the world, that the full texts of these
                     great Tablets should now be available for a broad readership. We express to the committees
                     who were commissioned to undertake and review these translations the deep gratitude
                     we feel for the care and sensitivity they have brought to the task. Bahá’ís will recognize
                     key passages from several of the Tablets that were introduced to the West by Shoghi
                     Effendi. His translations into English of the Bahá’í Holy Texts provide an enduring
                     standard for the efforts of those who rise to the challenge of preparing appropriate
                     renderings into English of these treasures of the Faith.

                     is the Object of the adoration of the entire creation, and by them the hearts of the
                     righteous have found rest and composure, could ye but know it! Through them the earth
                     hath been established, the clouds have rained down their bounty, and the bread of
                     holiness hath descended from the heaven of grace, could ye but perceive it!

                     will be moved to arise with Thee. Aid, then, Thy Lord through such ascendancy and
                     might as We have bestowed upon Thee. Take heed lest Thou falter on that Day when all
                     created things are filled with dismay; rather be Thou the revealer of My name, the
                     Self-Subsisting. Assist Thy Lord to the utmost of Thine ability, and pay no heed to
                     the peoples of the world, for that which their mouths utter is like unto the droning
                     of a gnat in an endless valley. Quaff the water of life in My name, the All-Merciful,
                     and proffer unto the near ones amongst the inmates of this heavenly garden that which
                     shall cause them to become detached from all names and enter beneath this blessed
                     and all-encompassing shadow.

                     in the heavens or on the earth, and called them to account for that which We had covenanted
                     with them before the foundation of the world. And lo, but for a few radiant faces
                     and eloquent tongues, We found most of the people dumbfounded, their eyes staring
                     up in fear. From the former We brought forth the creation of all that hath been and
                     all that shall be. These are they whose countenances God hath graciously turned away
                     from the face of the unbelievers, and whom He hath sheltered beneath the shadow of
                     the Tree of His own Being; they upon whose hearts He hath bestowed the gift of peace
                     and tranquillity, and whom He hath strengthened and assisted through the hosts of
                     the seen and the unseen.

                     yourselves of the Beauty of your Lord, the All-Glorious, the Best-Beloved. Erelong
                     shall We bring into being through you keen and penetrating eyes that will contemplate
                     the manifold signs of their Creator and turn away from all that is perceived by the
                     people of the world. Through you shall We bestow the power of vision upon whomsoever

                     of the Utterance of your Lord, the All-Merciful. They shall assuredly perceive the

                     have taught thee whatsoever had remained concealed in the Bayán, and have bestowed
                     upon thee the power of utterance, that thou mayest make mention of Mine exalted Self
                     amidst My creatures. Proclaim, then, this wondrous and mighty Remembrance, and fear
                     not the manifestations of the Evil One. Thou wert called into being for this very
                     purpose by virtue of My transcendent and all-compelling command. Through thee have
                     We unloosed the Tongue of Utterance to expound all that hath been, and We shall again,
                     by My sovereign power, unloose it to speak of that which is yet to come. Erelong shall
                     We bring into being through thee eloquent tongues that will praise and extol Me amongst
                     the Concourse of eternity and amidst the peoples of the world. Thus have the verses
                     of God been revealed, and thus hath it been decreed by the Lord of all names and attributes.
                     Thy Lord, verily, is the True One, the Knower of things unseen. Nothing whatsoever
                     shall prevent these tongues from magnifying their Creator. Through them, all created
                     things shall arise to glorify the Lord of names and to bear witness that there is
                     none other God save Me, the All-Powerful, the Most Glorious, the Best-Beloved. Nor
                     shall those who make mention of Me speak aught unless they be inspired by this Tongue
                     from its heavenly garden. Few, however, are they who understand! No tongue is there
                     that speaketh not the praises of its Lord and maketh not mention of His Name. Amongst
                     the people, however, are those who understand and utter praises, and those who utter
                     praises, yet understand not.

                     from Whose gaze appear the glances of the All-Glorious, and in Whose ways are revealed

                     hath appeared again in His name, the Most Glorious. Leave this people unto themselves,
                     and repair unto the Tabernacle of majesty and glory, wherein Thou shalt encounter
                     a people whose faces shine as brightly as the sun in its noontide splendour, and who

                     from everlasting, have been created through the Word of God. Thus have We made plain

                     him with the garment of one of Our Names, and exalted him to such a station that all
                     were moved to extol him, and how We so protected him from the harm of the malevolent
                     as to disarm even the mightiest amongst them.

                     <a id="861104550" class="brl-location"></a>We arose alone before the gaze of the peoples of earth and heaven at a time when all
                     had determined to slay us. While dwelling in their midst, We continually made mention
                     of the Lord, celebrated His praise, and stood firm in His Cause, until at last the
                     Word of God was vindicated amongst His creatures, His signs were spread abroad, His
                     power exalted, and His sovereignty revealed in its full splendour. To this bear witness
                     all His honoured servants. Yet when My brother beheld the rising fame of the Cause,
                     he became filled with arrogance and pride. Thereupon he emerged from behind the veil
                     of concealment, rose up against Me, disputed My verses, denied My testimony, and repudiated
                     My signs. Nor would his hunger be appeased unless he were to devour My flesh and drink
                     My blood. To this testify such of God’s servants as have accompanied Him in His exile,
                     and, beyond them, they that enjoy near access unto Him.

                     Mine assistance the hosts of the seen and the unseen, protected Me by the power of
                     truth, and sent down upon Me that which thwarted his purpose. Thus were foiled the
                     plots of those who disbelieve in the verses of the All-Merciful. They, truly, are
                     a rejected people. When news spread of that which the promptings of self had impelled
                     My brother to attempt, and Our companions in exile learned of his nefarious design,
                     the voice of their indignation and grief was lifted up and threatened to spread throughout
                     the city. We forbade, however, such recriminations, and enjoined upon them patience,
                     that they might be of those that endure steadfastly.

                     and enjoined upon God’s servants to show forth patience and fortitude. Removing Ourself
                     from their midst, We took up residence in another house, that perchance the flame
                     of envy might be quenched in Our brother’s breast, and that he might be guided aright.
                     We neither opposed him, nor saw him again thereafter, but remained in Our home, placing
                     Our hopes in the bounty of God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting. When, however,
                     he realized that his deed had been exposed, he seized the pen of calumny and wrote
                     unto the servants of God, attributing what he had himself committed unto Mine own
                     peerless and wronged Beauty. His purpose was none other than to inspire mischief and
                     to instil hatred into the hearts of those who had believed in God, the All-Glorious,
                     the All-Loving.

                     in his bosom until he had committed that which no pen dare describe, and by which
                     he disgraced the dignity of My station and profaned the sanctity of God, the Almighty,
                     the All-Glorious, the All-Praised. Were God to turn all the oceans of the earth into
                     ink and all created things into pens, they would not suffice Me to exhaust the record
                     of his wrongdoings. Thus do We recount that which befell Us, that haply ye may be

                     noisome savours of enmity can be perceived, those who are so enslaved by their lust
                     for leadership that they would not hesitate to destroy themselves in their desire
                     to emblazon their fame and perpetuate their names. God hath recorded such souls in
                     the Preserved Tablet as mere worshippers of names. Recount then that which Thou hast
                     purposed for this Temple, that its signs and tokens may be made manifest upon earth,
                     and that the brightness of this Light may illumine the horizons of the world and cleanse

                     Reach out to the Tablet that hath dawned above the horizon of the pen of Thy Lord,
                     and take hold of it in such wise that, through Thee, the hands of all who inhabit
                     the earth may be enabled to lay fast hold upon it. This, in truth, is that which becometh
                     Thee, if Thou be of those who understand. Through the upraising of Thy hand to the
                     heaven of My grace, the hands of all created things shall be lifted up to their Lord,
                     the Mighty, the Powerful, the Gracious. Erelong shall We raise up, through the aid
                     of Thy hand, other hands endued with power, with strength and might, and shall establish
                     through them Our dominion over all that dwell in the realms of revelation and creation.
                     Thus will the servants of God recognize the truth that there is none other God beside
                     Me, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting. With these hands, moreover, We shall both
                     bestow and withhold, though none can understand this save those who see with the eye
                     of the spirit.

                     God are joined to this Most Great Ocean, could ye but perceive it, and whatever hath
                     been set forth in His Books hath attained its final consummation in this most exalted

                     the peoples of the world have denied this grace! Every tree hath been endowed with
                     the choicest fruits, every ocean enriched with the most luminous gems. Man, himself,
                     hath been invested with the gifts of understanding and knowledge. The whole creation

                     unseen. The time is approaching when every created thing will have cast its burden.

                     revealed by this Most Great Spirit, if ye be of them that comprehend. And that innate
                     and untaught nature in its essence is called into being by the verses of God, the
                     Help in Peril, the All-Glorious, the Best-Beloved. Say: This nature prideth itself
                     in its relation to Our transcendent Truth, whilst We, for Our part, glory neither
                     in it nor in aught else, for all beside Myself hath been created through the potency
                     of My word, could ye but understand.

                     the sovereignty of God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting. A single one of them
                     sufficeth for a proof unto all who are in the heavens and on the earth; yet the people,
                     for the most part, persist in their heedlessness. Should it be Our wish, We would

                     that which displeaseth Him. Stand abashed before the One Who, as ye well know, hath
                     created you out of a drop of water.<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#742230031">[4]</a></sup> Say: We have created all that are in heaven and on earth in the nature made by God.
                     Whosoever turneth unto this blessed Countenance shall manifest the potentialities
                     of that inborn nature, and whosoever remaineth veiled therefrom shall be deprived
                     of this invisible and all-encompassing grace. Verily, there is naught from which Our

                     each and all, and by a word of Our mouth presented unto them the trust of Our love.
                     They that have accepted it are indeed safe and secure, and are numbered among those
                     who are immune from the terrors of this Day. Those, however, who have rejected it
                     have, in truth, disbelieved in God, the Help in Peril, the Self-Subsisting. Thus do

                     His Cause transcendeth all that was and all that shall be. Enter, O people, the City

                     Whensoever We revealed Our clear verses unto such men, they rejected them, and whensoever
                     they beheld that which the combined forces of the earth are powerless to produce,
                     they pronounced it sorcery.

                     “Approach them not,” one was even heard to say, “for they cast a spell upon the people

                     By the righteousness of the one true God! He who is incapable of speaking in Our presence

                     <a id="547283205" class="brl-location"></a>Within the treasury of Our Wisdom there lieth unrevealed a knowledge, one word of
                     which, if we chose to divulge it to mankind, would cause every human being to recognize
                     the Manifestation of God and to acknowledge His omniscience, would enable every one
                     to discover the secrets of all the sciences, and to attain so high a station as to
                     find himself wholly independent of all past and future learning. Other knowledges
                     We do as well possess, not a single letter of which We can disclose, nor do We find
                     humanity able to hear even the barest reference to their meaning. Thus have We informed
                     you of the knowledge of God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Were We to find worthy
                     vessels, We would impart unto them the treasures of hidden meanings and apprise them
                     of a knowledge, one letter of which would encompass all created things.

                     <a id="154048839" class="brl-location"></a>O Inmost Heart of this Temple! We have made thee the dawning-place of Our knowledge
                     and the dayspring of Our wisdom unto all who are in heaven and on earth. From thee
                     have We caused all sciences to appear, and unto thee shall We cause them to return.
                     And from thee shall We bring them forth a second time. Such, indeed, is Our promise,
                     and potent are We to effect Our purpose. Erelong shall We bring into being through
                     thee exponents of new and wondrous sciences, of potent and effective crafts, and shall
                     make manifest through them that which the heart of none of Our servants hath yet conceived.
                     Thus do We bestow upon whom We will whatsoever We desire, and thus do We withdraw
                     from whom We will what We had once bestowed. Even so do We ordain whatsoever We please
                     through Our behest.

                     upon the mirrors of all things, and, at another, to withhold from them the splendours
                     of Our light, this verily lieth within Our power, and none hath the right to ask “why”
                     or “wherefore”. For We are potent indeed to achieve Our purpose, and render no account
                     for that which We bring to pass; and none can doubt this save those who join partners
                     with God and question His Truth. Say: Nothing can withstand the power of Our might
                     or interrupt the course of Our command. We exalt whomsoever We please unto the Realm
                     of supernal might and glory, and, should We so desire, cause the same to sink into
                     the lowest abyss of degradation.

Would ye contend that if We raise up a soul unto the Sadratu’l-Muntahá,<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#876128131">[6]</a></sup> it shall then cease to be subject to the power of Our sovereignty and dominion? Nay,
                     by Mine own Self! Should it be Our wish, We would return it to the dust in less than
                     the twinkling of an eye. Consider a tree: Behold how We plant it in a garden, and
                     nourish it with the waters of Our loving care; and how, when it hath grown tall and
                     mature, and brought forth verdant leaves and goodly fruits, lo, We send forth the
                     tempestuous gales of Our decree, and lay it uprooted and prostrate upon the face of
                     the earth. So hath it been Our way with all things, and so shall it be in this day.
                     Such, in truth, are the matchless wonders of Our immutable method—a method which hath
                     ever governed, and shall continue to govern, all things, if ye be of them that perceive.
                     None, however, knoweth the wisdom thereof save God, the All-Powerful, the Almighty,
                     the All-Wise.

                     among the most ignorant of all people. Every atom in the universe would charge such
                     a man with imposture, and to this beareth witness My tongue which speaketh naught
                     but the truth. Magnify My Cause and promulgate My teachings and commandments, for
                     none other course beside this shall beseem you, and no other path shall ever lead
                     unto Him. Would that ye might heed Our counsel!

                     titles, the Dawning-Place of each one of Our most august attributes, and the Fountainhead
                     of each one of Our manifold virtues unto the denizens of earth and heaven. Thereafter
                     have We raised Thee up in Our own image betwixt the heavens and the earth, and ordained
                     Thee to be the sign of Our glory unto all who are in the realms of revelation and
                     creation, that My servants may follow in Thy footsteps, and be of them who are guided
                     aright. We have appointed Thee the Tree of grace and bounty unto the dwellers of both
                     the heavens and the earth. Well is it with them who seek the shelter of Thy shade
                     and who draw nigh unto Thy Self, the omnipotent Protector of the worlds.

                     streams of divine wisdom and understanding to gush forth and flow in the garden of
                     Our Cause—streams whose number none can reckon save Thy Lord, the Most Holy, the Omnipotent,
                     the Omniscient, the All-Wise. Say: We have generated all Letters from the Point and
                     have caused them to return unto It, and We have sent It down again in the form of
                     a human temple. All glory be unto the Author of this incomparable and wondrous handiwork!
                     Erelong shall We unfold and expound It again, in Our name, the All-Glorious. This
                     is indeed a token of Our grace, and I, truly, am the Most Bountiful, the Ancient of
                     Days.

                     All glory be unto the Lord of strength, might, and power! None can withstand the operation
                     of My will or the exercise of My might. I am He Who hath raised up all creatures through
                     a word of My mouth, and My power is, in truth, equal to My purpose.

                     <a id="793138024" class="brl-location"></a>Say: It is in Our power, should We wish it, to cause all created things to expire
                     in an instant, and, with the next, to endue them again with life. The knowledge thereof,
                     however, is with God alone, the All-Knowing, the All-Informed. It is in Our power,
                     should We wish it, to enable a speck of floating dust to generate, in less than the
                     twinkling of an eye, suns of infinite, of unimaginable splendour, to cause a dewdrop
                     to develop into vast and numberless oceans, to infuse into every letter such a force
                     as to empower it to unfold all the knowledge of past and future ages. This, in truth,
                     is a matter simple of accomplishment. Such have been the evidences of My power from
                     the beginning that hath no beginning until the end that hath no end. My creatures,
                     however, have been oblivious of My power, have repudiated My sovereignty, and contended
                     with Mine own Self, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.

                     <a id="864043666" class="brl-location"></a>Say: Of all that lieth between heaven and earth, naught can stir except by My leave,
                     and unto My Kingdom none can ascend save at My behest. My creatures, however, have
                     remained veiled from My might and My sovereignty, and are numbered with the heedless.
                     Say: Naught is seen in My revelation but the Revelation of God, and in My might but
                     His Might, could ye but know it. Say: My creatures are even as the leaves of a tree.
                     They proceed from the tree, and depend upon it for their existence, yet remain oblivious
                     of their root and origin. We draw such similitudes for the sake of Our discerning
                     servants that perchance they may transcend a mere plant-like level of existence and
                     attain unto true maturity in this resistless and immovable Cause. Say: My creatures
                     are even as the fish of the deep. Their life dependeth upon the water, and yet they
                     remain unaware of that which, by the grace of an omniscient and omnipotent Lord, sustaineth
                     their very existence. Indeed, their heedlessness is such that were they asked concerning
                     the water and its properties, they would prove entirely ignorant. Thus do We set forth
                     comparisons and similitudes, that perchance the people may turn unto Him Who is the
                     Object of the adoration of the entire creation.

                     before Our throne, and yet failed to perceive or comprehend; these are indeed a contemptible
                     people. We recited unto them verses that would enrapture the dwellers of the heavenly

                     Who is the Creator of all Names. We testify that such men are of a truth amongst the

                     Thee out from amongst all Our creatures, and have appointed Thee as the Manifestation
                     of Our own Self unto all who are in the heavens and on the earth.

                     shall testify to Thy sovereignty and dominion, bear witness to Thy might and glory,
                     and be the manifestations of Thy Names amidst mankind. We have caused Thee again to
                     be the Origin and the Creator of all mirrors, even as We brought them forth from Thee
                     aforetime. And We shall cause Thee to return unto Mine own Self, even as We called
                     Thee forth in the beginning. Thy Lord, verily, is the Unconstrained, the All-Powerful,
                     the All-Compelling. Warn, then, these mirrors, once they have been made manifest,
                     lest they swell with pride before their Creator and Fashioner when He appeareth amongst
                     them, or let the trappings of leadership debar them from bowing in submission before
                     God, the Almighty, the All-Beauteous.

                     by virtue of My command. Beware lest ye deny the verses of My Lord, and be of them
                     who have wrought injustice and are numbered with the lost. Beware lest ye cling unto
                     that which ye possess, or take pride in your fame and renown. That which behoveth
                     you is to wholly detach yourselves from all that is in the heavens and on the earth.

                     into mirrors of My Names, this undoubtedly is in My power, how much more in the power
                     of My Lord, Who hath called Me into being through His all-compelling and inscrutable
                     command. And should I choose to revolutionize the entire creation in the twinkling
                     of an eye, this assuredly is possible unto Me, how much more unto that sovereign Purpose
                     enshrined in the Will of God, My Lord and the Lord of all the worlds.

                     your very lives, in the path of God, and invoke Him to the number of the grains of
                     sand, the drops of rain, and the waves of the sea, and yet oppose the Manifestation
                     of His Cause at the time of His appearance, your works shall in no wise be mentioned

                     in Him in these days, God perchance will put away your sins. He, verily, is the All-Glorious,

                     not wax proud before the One through Whom whatsoever hath been revealed from all eternity
                     hath been confirmed. Happy is he who approacheth this Most Sublime Vision, and woe

                     the ordinance of the fast was first established! Such men are, in truth, of the ignorant.
                     And how many those who subsist on the coarsest bread, who take for their only seat
                     the grass of the field, and who undergo every manner of hardship, merely to maintain
                     their superiority in the eyes of men! Thus do We expose their deeds, that this may

                     Nay, by Him Who is the Self of God, the All-Glorious, the All-Compelling! Should your
                     names fade from every mortal mind, and yet God be well pleased with you, ye will indeed
                     be numbered among the treasures of His name, the Most Hidden. Thus have We sent down
                     Our verses that they may attract you unto the Source of all Lights, and acquaint you
                     with the purpose of your Lord, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. Abstain, then, from
                     all that hath been forbidden unto you in the Book, and eat of the lawful things which
                     God hath provided for your sustenance. Deprive not yourselves of His goodly bestowals,
                     for He, verily, is the Most Generous, the Lord of grace abounding. Subject not yourselves
                     to excessive hardships, but follow the way We have made plain unto you through Our
                     luminous verses and perspicuous proofs, and be not of the negligent.

                     and from similar transgressions which have been forbidden you in the Book, for should
                     ye commit such deeds, the dignity of your station would then be tainted in the eyes
                     of the people, your affairs would be disrupted, and your name disgraced and dishonoured.
                     Nay, your true and abiding glory resideth in submission to the Word of Him Who is
                     the Eternal Truth, and in your inward and outward detachment from aught else besides
                     God, the All-Compelling, the Almighty. Great is the blessedness of that divine that
                     hath not allowed knowledge to become a veil between him and the One Who is the Object
                     of all knowledge, and who, when the Self-Subsisting appeared, hath turned with a beaming
                     face towards Him. He, in truth, is numbered with the learned. The inmates of Paradise
                     seek the blessing of his breath, and his lamp sheddeth its radiance over all who are
                     in heaven and on earth. He, verily, is numbered with the inheritors of the Prophets.
                     He that beholdeth him hath, verily, beheld the True One, and he that turneth towards
                     him hath, verily, turned towards God, the Almighty, the All-Wise.

                     changed, for as ye change, most men will, likewise, change. This, verily, is an injustice
                     unto yourselves and unto others. Unto this beareth witness every man of discernment
                     and insight. Ye are even as a spring. If it be changed, so will the streams that branch
                     out from it be changed. Fear God, and be numbered with the godly. In like manner,
                     if the heart of man be corrupted, his limbs will also be corrupted. And similarly,
                     if the root of a tree be corrupted, its branches, and its offshoots, and its leaves,
                     and its fruits, will be corrupted. Thus have We set forth similitudes for your instruction,
                     that perchance ye may not be debarred by the things ye possess from attaining unto
                     that which hath been destined for you by Him Who is the All-Glorious, the Most Bountiful.

                     <a id="461782437" class="brl-location"></a>It is indeed in Our power to take up a handful of dust and to adorn it with the vesture
                     of Our Names. This, however, would be but a sign of Our favour, and not an indication
                     of any merit it may have inherently possessed. Thus hath it been revealed in truth
                     by Him Who is the Sovereign Revealer, the All-Knowing. Consider the Black Stone,<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#833955550">[9]</a></sup> which God hath made a point whereunto all men turn in adoration. Hath this bounty
                     been conferred upon it by virtue of its innate excellence? Nay, by Mine own Self!
                     Or doth such distinction stem from its intrinsic worth? Nay, by Mine own Being, Whose
                     Essence all creation hath failed to grasp!

                     <a id="831082144" class="brl-location"></a>Again, consider the Mosque of Aqṣá and the other places which We have made sanctuaries
                     unto the people in every land and region. The honour and distinction they enjoy is
                     in no wise due to their own merit, but stemmeth from their relation to Our Manifestations,
                     Whom We have appointed as the Daysprings of Our Revelation amidst mankind, if ye be
                     of them that understand. In this there lieth a wisdom inscrutable to all save God.
                     Inquire, that He may graciously make plain unto you His purpose. His knowledge, verily,
                     embraceth all things. Detach yourselves, O people, from the world and all its vanities,
                     and heed not the call of such as have disbelieved in God and joined partners with
                     Him. Arise above the horizon of utterance to extol and praise your Lord, the All-Merciful.
                     This is that which God hath purposed for you; well is it with them who perceive it.

                     <a id="319221802" class="brl-location"></a>Say: O people! We have commanded you in Our Tablets to strive, at the time of the
                     promised Revelation, to sanctify your souls from all names, and to purify them from
                     all that hath been created in the heavens or on the earth, that therein may appear
                     the splendours of the Sun of Truth which shineth forth above the horizon of the Will
                     of your Lord, the Almighty, the Most Great. We have, moreover, commanded you to cleanse
                     your hearts from every trace of the love or hate of the peoples of the world, lest
                     aught should divert you from one course or impel you towards another. This, verily,
                     is among the weightiest counsels I have vouchsafed unto you in the perspicuous Book,
                     for whoso attacheth himself to either of these shall be prevented from attaining a
                     proper understanding of Our Cause. To this beareth witness every just and discerning

                     turned away from Him Whose appearance hath solaced the eyes of every true believer
                     in the Divine Unity. Lift up the veils and coverings that obscure your vision, and
                     consider the testimonies of the Prophets and Messengers, that haply ye may recognize
                     the Cause of God in these days when the Promised One hath come invested with a mighty
                     sovereignty. Fear God, and debar yourselves not from Him Who is the Dayspring of His
                     signs. This shall, in truth, but profit your own selves; as to your Lord, He, verily,
                     can afford to dispense with all creatures. From everlasting was He alone; there was
                     none else besides Him. He it is in Whose name the standard of Divine Unity hath been
                     planted upon the Sinai of the visible and invisible worlds, proclaiming that there
                     is none other God but Me, the Peerless, the Glorious, the Incomparable.

                     aside from Him and have taken unto themselves a lord and master beside God; these,
                     truly, are of the wayward. The mention of the All-Merciful hath at all times been
                     upon their lips, and yet when He was manifested unto them through the power of truth
                     they warred against Him. Wretched indeed shall be the plight of such as have broken
                     the Covenant of their Lord when the Luminary of the world shone forth above the horizon
                     of the Will of God, the Most Holy, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise! It was against God
                     that they unsheathed the swords of malice and hatred, and yet they perceive it not.
                     Methinks they remain dead and buried in the tombs of their selfish desires, though
                     the breeze of God hath blown over all regions. They, truly, are wrapt in a dense and
                     grievous veil. And oft as the verses of God are rehearsed unto them, they persist
                     in proud disdain; it is as though they were devoid of all understanding, or had never
                     heard the Melody of God, the Most Exalted, the All-Knowing.

                     the All-Merciful. Beware lest ye be veiled by aught that hath been revealed in the
                     Bayán: It was, in truth, revealed for no other purpose than to make mention of Me,
                     the All-Powerful, the Most High, and had no other object than My Beauty. The whole
                     world hath been filled with My testimony, if ye be of them that judge with fairness.

                     wept sore in His remoteness from Me. He preceded Me that He might summon the people
                     unto My Kingdom, as it hath been set forth in the Tablets, could ye but perceive it!
                     O would that men of hearing might be found who could hear the voice of His lamentation
                     in the Bayán bewailing that which hath befallen Me at the hands of these heedless
                     souls, bemoaning His separation from Me and giving utterance to His longing to be
                     united with Me, the Mighty, the Peerless. He, verily, beholdeth at this moment His
                     Best-Beloved amidst those who were created to attain His Day and to prostrate themselves
                     before Him, and yet who have inflicted in their tyranny such abasement upon Him as

                     of transcendent glory, this Seat of stainless sanctity, and announced unto you the
                     advent of the Days of God. Yet, when the most great veil was rent asunder, and the
                     Ancient Beauty came unto you in the clouds of God’s decree, ye repudiated Him in Whom
                     ye had believed aforetime. Woe betide you, O company of infidels! Fear ye God, and
                     nullify not the truth with the things ye possess. When the luminary of divine verses
                     dawneth upon you from the horizon of the Pen of the King of all names and attributes,
                     fall ye prostrate upon your faces before God, the Lord of the Worlds. For to bow down
                     in adoration at the threshold of His door is indeed better for you than the worship
                     of both worlds, and to submit to His Revelation is more profitable unto you than whatsoever
                     hath been created in the heavens and on the earth.

                     Me up by the power of truth, and made Me the Source of His remembrance amidst His
                     creatures. Hasten to behold this divine and glorious Vision, the Spot wherein God
                     hath established His Seat. Follow not that which the Evil One whispereth in your hearts,
                     for he, verily, doth prompt you to walk after your lusts and covetous desires, and
                     hindereth you from treading the straight Path which this all-embracing and all-compelling
                     Cause hath opened.

                     He Who is the Beauty of the All-Merciful hath likewise been made manifest with an

                     All-Merciful hath been raised, and behind it the call of Satan. Well is it with them
                     who hearken unto the Voice of God, and turn their faces towards His throne to behold
                     a most holy and blessed Vision. For whoso cherisheth in his heart the love of anyone
                     beside Me, be it to the extent of a grain of mustard seed, shall be unable to gain
                     admittance into My Kingdom. To this beareth witness that which adorneth the preamble
                     of the Book of Existence, could ye but perceive it. Say: This is the Day whereon God’s
                     most great favour hath been made manifest. The voice of all who are in the heavens
                     above and on the earth below proclaimeth My Name, and singeth forth My praises, could

                        whilst before Him march the angels of Paradise, bearing the banners of His signs.
                        Beware lest any name debar thee from God, the Creator of earth and heaven. Leave thou

                        and His beauty was unveiled, they turned aside from Him and disputed with Him. Thus
                        do We impart unto thee that which hath been recorded in the Books and Scriptures.
                        None save a very few, who were destitute of any power amongst men, turned towards

                        prideth himself on His Name! In like manner, consider how numerous, in these days,
                        are the monks who, in My Name, have secluded themselves in their churches, and who,

                        Say: He Who is the Unconstrained is come, in the clouds of light, that He may quicken
                        the world with the breezes of His name, the Most Merciful, and unite its peoples,
                        and gather all men around this Table which hath been sent down from heaven. Beware
                        that ye deny not the favour of God after it hath been sent down unto you. Better is
                        this for you than that which ye possess; for that which is yours perisheth, whilst
                        that which is with God endureth. He, in truth, ordaineth what He pleaseth. Verily,
                        the breezes of forgiveness have been wafted from the direction of your Lord, the God
                        of Mercy; whoso turneth thereunto shall be cleansed of his sins, and of all pain and
                        sickness. Happy the man that hath turned towards them, and woe betide him that hath
                        turned aside.

                        effulgent glory upon all who are in heaven and all who are on earth. Arise thou to
                        serve God and help His Cause. He, verily, will assist thee with the hosts of the seen
                        and unseen, and will set thee king over all that whereon the sun riseth. Thy Lord,

                        <a id="645694905" class="brl-location"></a>O King! The stars of the heaven of knowledge have fallen, they who seek to establish
                        the truth of My Cause through the things they possess, and who make mention of God
                        in My Name. And yet, when I came unto them in My glory, they turned aside. They, indeed,
                        are of the fallen. This is, truly, that which the Spirit of God hath announced, when
                        He came with truth unto you, He with Whom the Jewish doctors disputed, till at last
                        they perpetrated what hath made the Holy Spirit to lament, and the tears of them that
                        have near access to God to flow. Consider how a Pharisee who had worshipped God for
                        seventy years repudiated the Son when He appeared, whereas one who had committed adultery
                        gained admittance into the Kingdom. Thus doth the Pen admonish thee as bidden by the
                        Eternal King, that thou mayest be apprised of what came to pass aforetime and be reckoned
                        in this day among them that truly believe.

                        Come ye out of them by My leave, and busy, then, yourselves with what will profit
                        you and others. Thus commandeth you He Who is the Lord of the Day of Reckoning. Seclude
                        yourselves in the stronghold of My love. This, truly, is the seclusion that befitteth
                        you, could ye but know it. He that secludeth himself in his house is indeed as one
                        dead. It behoveth man to show forth that which will benefit mankind. He that bringeth
                        forth no fruit is fit for the fire. Thus admonisheth you your Lord; He, verily, is
                        the Mighty, the Bountiful. Enter ye into wedlock, that after you another may arise
                        in your stead. We, verily, have forbidden you lechery, and not that which is conducive
                        to fidelity. Have ye clung unto the promptings of your nature, and cast behind your
                        backs the statutes of God? Fear ye God, and be not of the foolish. But for man, who,
                        on My earth, would remember Me, and how could My attributes and My names be revealed?
                        Reflect, and be not of them that have shut themselves out as by a veil from Him, and
                        were of those that are fast asleep. He that married not could find no place wherein
                        to abide, nor where to lay His head, by reason of what the hands of the treacherous
                        had wrought. His holiness consisted not in the things ye have believed and imagined,
                        but rather in the things which belong unto Us. Ask, that ye may be made aware of His
                        station which hath been exalted above the vain imaginings of all the peoples of the
                        earth. Blessed are they that understand.

                        the decision made regarding the war.<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#863054978">[12]</a></sup> Thy Lord, verily, knoweth, is informed of all. Thou didst say: “I lay asleep upon
                        my couch, when the cry of the oppressed, who were drowned in the Black Sea, wakened
                        me.” This is what We heard thee say, and, verily, thy Lord is witness unto what I
                        say. We testify that that which wakened thee was not their cry but the promptings
                        of thine own passions, for We tested thee, and found thee wanting. Comprehend the
                        meaning of My words, and be thou of the discerning. It is not Our wish to address
                        thee words of condemnation, out of regard for the dignity We conferred upon thee in
                        this mortal life. We, verily, have chosen courtesy, and made it the true mark of such
                        as are nigh unto Him. Courtesy is, in truth, a raiment which fitteth all men, whether
                        young or old. Well is it with him that adorneth his temple therewith, and woe unto
                        him who is deprived of this great bounty. Hadst thou been sincere in thy words, thou
                        wouldst have not cast behind thy back the Book of God, when it was sent unto thee
                        by Him Who is the Almighty, the All-Wise. We have proved thee through it, and found
                        thee other than that which thou didst profess. Arise, and make amends for that which
                        escaped thee. Erelong the world and all that thou possessest will perish, and the
                        kingdom will remain unto God, thy Lord and the Lord of thy fathers of old. It behoveth
                        thee not to conduct thine affairs according to the dictates of thy desires. Fear the
                        sighs of this Wronged One, and shield Him from the darts of such as act unjustly.

                        and yet the people are wrapped in a thick veil! Say: Do ye cavil at Him Who hath come

                        His signs? These things are not from Himself; nay, rather they proceed from the One
                        Who hath raised Him up, sent Him forth through the power of truth, and made Him to
                        be a lamp unto all mankind.

                        <a id="091050252" class="brl-location"></a>More grievous became Our plight from day to day, nay, from hour to hour, until they
                        took Us forth from Our prison and made Us, with glaring injustice, enter the Most
                        Great Prison. And if anyone ask them: “For what crime were they imprisoned?”, they
                        would answer and say: “They, verily, sought to supplant the Faith with a new religion!”
                        If that which is ancient be what ye prefer, wherefore, then, have ye discarded that
                        which hath been set down in the Torah and the Evangel? Clear it up, O men! By My life!
                        There is no place for you to flee to in this day. If this be My crime, then Muḥammad,
                        the Apostle of God, committed it before Me, and before Him He Who was the Spirit of
                        God, and yet earlier He Who conversed with God. And if My sin be this, that I have
                        exalted the Word of God and revealed His Cause, then indeed am I the greatest of sinners!

                        several Tablets, that which We were commanded, yet We do it once again as a token
                        of God’s grace. Perchance they may recognize the Lord, Who hath come down in the clouds

                        deter Me from My purpose. Should they hide Me away in the depths of the earth, yet
                        would they find Me riding aloft on the clouds, and calling out unto God, the Lord
                        of strength and of might. I have offered Myself up in the way of God, and I yearn
                        after tribulations in My love for Him, and for the sake of His good pleasure. Unto
                        this bear witness the woes which now afflict Me, the like of which no other man hath
                        suffered. Every single hair of Mine head calleth out that which the Burning Bush uttered
                        on Sinai, and each vein of My body invoketh God and saith: “O would I had been severed
                        in Thy path, so that the world might be quickened, and all its peoples be united!”
                        Thus hath it been decreed by Him Who is the All-Knowing, the All-Informed.

                        the shepherds of the fold, or pride and conceit to deter you from turning unto the
                        poor and the desolate. Wert thou to quaff the mystic Wine of everlasting life from
                        the chalice of the words of thy Lord, the All-Merciful, thou wouldst be enabled to
                        forsake all that thou dost possess and to proclaim My Name before all mankind. Cleanse
                        then thy soul with the waters of detachment. Verily, this is the Remembrance that
                        hath shone forth above the horizon of creation, which shall purge thy soul from the
                        dross of the world. Abandon thy palaces to the people of the graves, and thine empire
                        to whosoever desireth it, and turn, then, unto the Kingdom. This, verily, is what
                        God hath chosen for thee, wert thou of them that turn unto Him. They that have failed
                        to turn unto the Countenance of God in this Revelation are indeed bereft of life.
                        They move as bidden by their own selfish desires, and are in truth accounted among
                        the dead. Shouldst thou desire to bear the weight of thy dominion, bear it then to
                        aid the Cause of thy Lord. Glorified be this station which whoever attaineth thereunto
                        hath attained unto all good that proceedeth from Him Who is the All-Knowing, the All-Wise.

                        which the knowledge of none can comprehend except His knowledge. Beware lest thou

                        Him with manifest injustice. Consider and call thou to mind the days whereon the Spirit
                        of God appeared, and Herod gave judgement against Him. God, however, aided Him with
                        the hosts of the unseen, and protected Him with truth, and sent Him down unto another
                        land, according to His promise. He, verily, ordaineth what He pleaseth. Thy Lord truly

                        and challenging as this. And whenever any one of them hath striven to improve its
                        condition, his motive hath been his own gain, whether confessedly so or not; and the
                        unworthiness of this motive hath limited his power to heal or cure.

                        <a id="062512306" class="brl-location"></a>That which the Lord hath ordained as the sovereign remedy and mightiest instrument
                        for the healing of all the world is the union of all its peoples in one universal
                        Cause, one common Faith. This can in no wise be achieved except through the power
                        of a skilled, an all-powerful and inspired Physician. This, verily, is the truth,
                        and all else naught but error. Each time that Most Mighty Instrument hath come, and
                        that Light shone forth from the Ancient Dayspring, He was withheld by ignorant physicians
                        who, even as clouds, interposed themselves between Him and the world. It failed, therefore,
                        to recover, and its sickness hath persisted until this day. They indeed were powerless
                        to protect it, or to effect a cure, whilst He Who hath been the Manifestation of Power
                        amongst men was withheld from achieving His purpose, by reason of what the hands of
                        the ignorant physicians have wrought.

                        <a id="208180700" class="brl-location"></a>Consider these days in which He Who is the Ancient Beauty hath come in the Most Great
                        Name, that He may quicken the world and unite its peoples. They, however, rose up
                        against Him with sharpened swords, and committed that which caused the Faithful Spirit
                        to lament, until in the end they imprisoned Him in the most desolate of cities, and
                        broke the grasp of the faithful upon the hem of His robe. Were anyone to tell them:
                        “The World Reformer is come”, they would answer and say: “Indeed it is proven that
                        He is a fomenter of discord!”, and this notwithstanding that they have never associated
                        with Him, and have perceived that He did not seek, for one moment, to protect Himself.
                        At all times He was at the mercy of the wicked doers. At one time they cast Him into
                        prison, at another they banished Him, and at yet another hurried Him from land to
                        land. Thus have they pronounced judgement against Us, and God, truly, is aware of
                        what I say. Such men are reckoned by God among the most ignorant of His creatures.
                        They cut off their own limbs and perceive it not; they deprive themselves of that
                        which is best for them, and know it not. They are even as a young child who can distinguish
                        neither the mischief-maker from the reformer nor the wicked from the righteous. We
                        behold them in this Day wrapt in a palpable veil.

                        He bade Me lift up My voice between earth and heaven, and for this there befell Me
                        what hath caused the tears of every man of understanding to flow. The learning current

                        there is no passing, uttereth praises to God, the Maker of all names and Creator of
                        earth and heaven, thou wouldst attain unto a station from which thou wouldst behold
                        in the world of being naught save the effulgence of the Adored One, and wouldst regard
                        thy sovereignty as the most contemptible of thy possessions, abandoning it to whosoever
                        might desire it, and setting thy face toward the Horizon aglow with the light of His

                        for the purpose of helping thy Lord, the Exalted, the Most High. Then would the Concourse

                        a place of safety, be it to the extent of a single foothold. At all times have I been
                        immersed in an ocean of tribulations, whose full measure none can fathom but God.
                        He, truly, is aware of what I say. How many the days in which My loved ones have been
                        sorely shaken by reason of My afflictions, and how many the nights during which My
                        kindred, fearing for My life, have bitterly wept and lamented! And this none can deny
                        save them that are bereft of truthfulness. Is it conceivable that He Who expecteth
                        to lose His life at any moment should seek after worldly vanities? How very strange
                        the imaginings of those who speak as prompted by their own caprices, and who wander
                        distractedly in the wilderness of self and passion! Erelong shall they be called upon
                        to account for their words, and on that day they shall find none to befriend or help

                        He hath raised up in truth and sent forth with His guidance are the Manifestations
                        of His most excellent names, the Revealers of His most exalted attributes, and the

                        of God hath been perfected unto all else but Him, the standard of Divine Unity hath
                        been raised, and the sign of sanctity hath been made manifest; and that through them

                        there is none other God but Him, that from everlasting He was alone with none else
                        besides Him, and that He shall be unto everlasting what He hath ever been. Too high
                        is the All-Merciful for the hearts of those who have recognized Him to apprehend His
                        true nature, or for the minds of men to hope to fathom His essence. He verily is exalted
                        above the understanding of anyone besides Himself, and sanctified beyond the comprehension
                        of all else save Him. From all eternity He hath been independent of the entire creation.

                        <a id="009991842" class="brl-location"></a>Fearing lest the actions of these transgressors should produce some outcome at variance
                        with thy world-adorning judgement, this Servant despatched a brief account of the
                        matter to Mírzá Sa‘íd <u>Kh</u>án<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#074101207">[18]</a></sup> at the Foreign Ministry, so that he might submit it to the royal presence and that
                        whatever thou shouldst please to decree in this respect might be obeyed. A long while
                        elapsed, and no decree was issued. Finally matters came to such a pass that there
                        loomed the threat of imminent strife and bloodshed. Of necessity, therefore, and for
                        the protection of the servants of God, a few of them appealed to the Governor of ‘Iráq.<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#673225801">[19]</a></sup>

                        <a id="524445119" class="brl-location"></a>Wert thou to observe these events with the eye of fairness, it would become clear
                        and evident in the luminous mirror of thine heart that what occurred was called for
                        by the circumstances, and that no other alternative could be seen. His Majesty himself
                        is witness that in whatever city a number of this people have resided, the hostility
                        of certain functionaries hath enkindled the flame of conflict and contention. This
                        evanescent Soul, however, hath, since His arrival in ‘Iráq, forbidden all to engage
                        in dissension and strife. The witness of this Servant is His very deeds, for all are
                        well aware and will testify that, although a greater number of this people resided
                        in ‘Iráq than in any other land, no one overstepped his limits or transgressed against
                        his neighbour. Fixing their gaze upon God, and reposing their trust in Him, all have
                        now been abiding in peace for well-nigh fifteen years, and, in whatever hath befallen
                        them, they have shown forth patience and resigned themselves to God.

                        <a id="695564270" class="brl-location"></a>After the arrival of this Servant in this, the city of Adrianople, some of the people
                        of ‘Iráq and elsewhere inquired about the meaning of the term “rendering assistance
                        unto God” which hath been mentioned in the Holy Scriptures. Several answers were sent
                        out in reply, one of which is set forth in these pages, that it may be clearly demonstrated
                        in the court of thy presence that this Servant hath had no end in view but to promote
                        the betterment and well-being of the world. And if certain of the divine favours which,
                        undeserving as I may be, God hath pleased to bestow upon Me be not plain and manifest,
                        this much at least will be clear and apparent, that He, in His surpassing mercy and
                        infinite grace, hath not deprived Mine heart of the ornament of reason. The passage
                        that was referred to concerning the meaning of “rendering assistance unto God” is
                        as follows:

                           <a id="640432425" class="brl-location"></a>It is clear and evident that the one true God—glorified be His mention!—is sanctified
                           above the world and all that is therein. By “rendering assistance unto God”, then,
                           it is not meant that any soul should fight or contend with another. That Sovereign
                           Lord Who doeth whatsoever He pleaseth hath entrusted the kingdom of creation, its
                           lands and its seas, into the hands of the kings, for they are, each according to his
                           degree, the manifestations of His divine power. Should they enter beneath the shadow
                           of the True One, they will be accounted of God, and if not, thy Lord, verily, knoweth
                           and observeth all things.

                           <a id="091463564" class="brl-location"></a>That which God—glorified be His Name!—hath desired for Himself is the hearts of His
                           servants, which are the treasuries of His love and remembrance and the repositories
                           of His knowledge and wisdom. It hath ever been the wish of the Eternal King to cleanse
                           the hearts of His servants from the things of the world and all that pertaineth thereunto,
                           that they may be made worthy recipients of the effulgent splendours of Him Who is
                           the King of all names and attributes. Wherefore must no stranger be allowed in the
                           city of the heart, that the incomparable Friend may enter His abode. By this is meant
                           the effulgence of His names and attributes, and not His exalted Essence, inasmuch
                           as that peerless King hath ever been, and shall eternally remain, sanctified above
                           ascent and descent.

                           <a id="581531547" class="brl-location"></a>It followeth, therefore, that rendering assistance unto God, in this day, doth not
                           and shall never consist in contending or disputing with any soul; nay rather, what
                           is preferable in the sight of God is that the cities of men’s hearts, which are ruled
                           by the hosts of self and passion, should be subdued by the sword of utterance, of
                           wisdom and of understanding. Thus, whoso seeketh to assist God must, before all else,
                           conquer, with the sword of inner meaning and explanation, the city of his own heart
                           and guard it from the remembrance of all save God, and only then set out to subdue
                           the cities of the hearts of others.

                           <a id="030172620" class="brl-location"></a>Such is the true meaning of rendering assistance unto God. Sedition hath never been
                           pleasing unto God, nor were the acts committed in the past by certain foolish ones
                           acceptable in His sight. Know ye that to be killed in the path of His good pleasure
                           is better for you than to kill. The beloved of the Lord must, in this day, behave
                           in such wise amidst His servants that they may by their very deeds and actions guide
                           all men unto the paradise of the All-Glorious.

                           will they ever, set their hopes upon the world and its ephemeral possessions. The
                           one true God hath ever regarded the hearts of men as His own, His exclusive possession—and
                           this too but as an expression of His all-surpassing mercy, that haply mortal souls
                           may be purged and sanctified from all that pertaineth to the world of dust and gain
                           admittance into the realms of eternity. For otherwise that ideal King is, in Himself
                           and by Himself, sufficient unto Himself and independent of all things. Neither doth
                           the love of His creatures profit Him, nor can their malice harm Him. All have issued
                           forth from abodes of dust, and unto dust shall they return, while the one true God,
                           alone and single, is established upon His Throne, a Throne which is beyond the reaches
                           of time and space, is sanctified above all utterance or expression, intimation, description
                           and definition, and is exalted beyond all notion of abasement and glory. And none
                           knoweth this save Him and those with whom is the knowledge of the Book. No God is
                           there but Him, the Almighty, the All-Bountiful.

                        either specific or limited in its scope, that it might be restricted to one or another
                        person, inasmuch as the shadow telleth of the One Who casteth it. God, glorified be
                        His remembrance, hath called Himself the Lord of the worlds, for He hath nurtured
                        and still nurtureth everyone. Glorified be, then, His grace that hath preceded all

                        people, those who are associated with its name have accepted and embraced it as true,
                        and have forsaken their all in their eagerness to partake of the things of God. That
                        they should evince such renunciation in the path of the love of the All-Merciful is
                        in itself a faithful witness and an eloquent testimony to the truth of their convictions.
                        Hath it ever been witnessed that a man of sound judgement should sacrifice his life
                        without cause or reason? And if it be suggested that this people have taken leave
                        of their senses, this too is highly improbable, inasmuch as such behaviour hath not
                        been confined to merely a soul or two—nay, a vast multitude of every class have drunk
                        their fill of the living waters of divine knowledge, and, intoxicated, have hastened
                        with heart and soul to the field of sacrifice in the way of the Beloved.

                        the <u>Sh</u>áh. It is then for thee to command, and I stand ready before the throne of thy sovereignty.
                        Decide, then, for Me or against Me.

                        <a id="874824715" class="brl-location"></a>The All-Merciful saith in the Qur’án, His abiding testimony unto all the peoples of
                        the world: “Wish ye then for death, if ye be men of truth.”<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#561881374">[22]</a></sup> Behold how He hath declared the yearning for death to be the touchstone of sincerity!
                        And, in the luminous mirror of thy judgement, it is doubtless clear and evident which
                        people have chosen, in this day, to lay down their lives in the path of the Beloved
                        of the worlds. Indeed, were the books supporting the beliefs of this people to be
                        written with the blood spilled in the path of God—exalted be His glory!—then countless
                        volumes would have already appeared amongst men for all to see.

                        <a id="279748061" class="brl-location"></a>How, We fain would ask, is it possible to impugn this people whose deeds are in conformity
                        with their words, and to give credence instead to those who have refused to relinquish
                        one jot of their worldly authority in the path of Him Who is the Unconstrained? Some
                        of the divines who have declared this Servant an infidel have at no time met with
                        Me. Never having seen Me, or become acquainted with My purpose, they have nevertheless
                        spoken as they pleased and acted as they desired. Yet every claim requireth a proof,
                        not mere words and displays of outward piety.

                        <a id="886643559" class="brl-location"></a>In this connection the text of several passages from the Hidden Book of Fáṭimih—the
                        blessings of God be upon her!—which are relevant to the present theme will be cited
                        in the Persian tongue, that certain matters which have ere now been hidden may be
                        revealed before thy presence. The people addressed in the aforementioned Book, which
                        is today known as the Hidden Words, are those who, though outwardly known for learning
                        and piety, are inwardly the slaves of self and passion.

                        <a id="945817032" class="brl-location"></a>He saith: O ye that are foolish, yet have a name to be wise! Wherefore do ye wear
                        the guise of the shepherd, when inwardly ye have become wolves, intent upon My flock?
                        Ye are even as the star, which riseth ere the dawn, and which, though it seem radiant
                        and luminous, leadeth the wayfarers of My city astray into the paths of perdition.

                        <a id="463005530" class="brl-location"></a>And likewise He saith: O ye seeming fair yet inwardly foul! Ye are like clear but
                        bitter water, which to outward seeming is crystal pure but of which, when tested by
                        the Divine Assayer, not a drop is accepted. Yea, the sunbeam falls alike upon the
                        dust and the mirror, yet differ they in reflection even as doth the star from the
                        earth: nay, immeasurable is the difference!

                        <a id="942058906" class="brl-location"></a>And also He saith: O essence of desire! At many a dawn have I turned from the realms
                        of the Placeless unto thine abode, and found thee on the bed of ease busied with others
                        than Myself. Thereupon, even as the flash of the spirit, I returned to the realms
                        of celestial glory, and breathed it not in My retreats above unto the hosts of holiness.
                     </p>

                        <a id="575476878" class="brl-location"></a>And again He saith: O bondslave of the world! Many a dawn hath the breeze of My loving-kindness
                        wafted over thee and found thee upon the bed of heedlessness fast asleep. Bewailing
                        then thy plight it returned whence it came.<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#167693795">[23]</a></sup>

                        <a id="977445054" class="brl-location"></a>Therefore, in the exercise of the royal justice, it is not sufficient to give ear
                        to the claimant alone. God saith in the Qur’án, the unerring Balance that distinguisheth
                        truth from falsehood: “O ye who believe! If a wicked man come to you with news, clear
                        it up at once, lest through ignorance ye harm others, and afterward repent of what
                        ye have done.”<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#788212014">[24]</a></sup> The holy Traditions, moreover, contain the admonition: “Believe not the tale-bearer.”
                        Certain of the divines, who have never seen Us, have misconceived the nature of Our
                        Cause. Those, however, who have met Us will testify that this Servant hath not spoken
                        save in accordance with that which God hath commanded in the Book, and that He hath
                        called attention to the following blessed verse—exalted be His Word: “Do ye not disavow
                        us only because we believe in God, and in what He hath sent down unto us, and in what
                        He had sent down aforetime?”<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#837140527">[25]</a></sup>

                        <a id="844688315" class="brl-location"></a>O King of the age! The eyes of these refugees are turned towards and fixed upon the
                        mercy of the Most Merciful. No doubt is there whatever that these tribulations will
                        be followed by the outpourings of a supreme mercy, and these dire adversities will
                        be succeeded by an overflowing prosperity. We fain would hope, however, that His Majesty
                        the <u>Sh</u>áh will himself examine these matters and bring hope to the hearts. That which We
                        have submitted to thy Majesty is indeed for thine highest good. And God, verily, is
                        a sufficient witness unto Me.

                        <a id="762363632" class="brl-location"></a>Glorified art Thou, O Lord My God! I bear witness that the heart of the King is in
                        truth between the fingers of Thy might. If it be Thy wish, do Thou incline it, O My
                        God, in the direction of charity and mercy. Thou, verily, art the Almighty, the Most
                        Exalted, the Most Bountiful. No God is there besides Thee, the All-Glorious, the One
                        Whose help is sought by all.

                        <a id="073828225" class="brl-location"></a>Concerning the prerequisites of the learned, He saith: “Whoso among the learned guardeth
                        his self, defendeth his faith, opposeth his desires, and obeyeth his Lord’s command,
                        it is incumbent upon the generality of the people to pattern themselves after him.…”<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#400251919">[26]</a></sup> Should the King of the Age reflect upon this utterance which hath streamed from the
                        tongue of Him Who is the Dayspring of the Revelation of the All-Merciful, he would
                        perceive that those who have been adorned with the attributes enumerated in this holy
                        Tradition are scarcer than the philosopher’s stone; wherefore not every man that layeth
                        claim to knowledge deserveth to be believed.

                        <a id="958508388" class="brl-location"></a>Again concerning the divines of the Latter Days, He saith: “The religious doctors
                        of that age shall be the most wicked of the divines beneath the shadow of heaven.
                        Out of them hath mischief proceeded, and unto them it shall return.” And again He
                        saith: “When the Standard of Truth is made manifest, the people of both the East and
                        the West curse it.”<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#615385386">[27]</a></sup> Should anyone dispute these Traditions, this Servant will undertake to establish
                        their validity, since the details of their transmission have been omitted here for
                        the sake of brevity.

                        <a id="351739188" class="brl-location"></a>Those doctors who have indeed drunk of the cup of renunciation have never interfered
                        with this Servant. Thus, for example, <u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u> Murtaḍá<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#597383161">[28]</a></sup>—may God exalt his station and cause him to repose beneath the canopy of His grace!—showed
                        forth kindness during Our sojourn in ‘Iráq, and never spoke of this Cause otherwise
                        than as God hath given leave. We beseech God to graciously assist all to do His will
                        and pleasure.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <a class="brl-pnum">235</a>
                        <a id="500205998" class="brl-location"></a>Now, however, all have lost sight of every other consideration, and are bent upon
                        the persecution of this people. Thus, if it be inquired of certain persons who, by
                        the grace of their Lord, repose beneath the shadow of thy royal mercy and enjoy countless
                        favours, “What service have ye rendered in return for these royal favours? Have ye
                        through wise policy annexed a further territory to the realm? Have ye applied yourselves
                        to aught that would secure the welfare of the people, the prosperity of the kingdom,
                        and the lasting glory of the state?”, they will have no other reply than to designate,
                        justly or falsely, a group of people before thy royal presence as Bábís, and forthwith
                        to engage in massacre and pillage. In Tabríz, for instance, and in the Egyptian town
                        of Manṣúríyyih, a number of this people were ransomed and large sums were seized,
                        yet no account of these matters was ever made in the court of thy presence.
                     </p>

                        <a class="brl-pnum">236</a>
                        <a id="163615936" class="brl-location"></a>The reason for which all these things have come to pass is that their persecutors,
                        finding these unfortunate ones without protection, have forgone more weighty matters
                        and occupied themselves instead with harassing this afflicted people. Numerous confessions
                        and divers creeds abide peacefully beneath the shadow of thy sovereignty. Let this
                        people be also numbered with them. Nay, those who serve the King should be animated
                        by such lofty aims and sublime intentions as to continually strive to bring all religions
                        beneath the shelter of his shadow, and to rule over them with perfect justice.

                        <a class="brl-pnum">237</a>
                        <a id="735618792" class="brl-location"></a>To enforce the laws of God is naught but justice, and is the source of universal content.
                        Nay more, the divine statutes have always been, and will ever remain, the cause and
                        instrument of the preservation of mankind, as witnessed by His exalted words: “In
                        punishment will ye find life, O men of insight!”<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#370570499">[29]</a></sup> It would, however, ill beseem the justice of thy Majesty that for the trespass of
                        a single soul a whole group of people should be subjected to the scourge of thy wrath.
                        The one true God—glorified be His Name!—hath said: “None shall bear the burden of
                        another.”<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#597221451">[30]</a></sup> It is clear and evident that in every community there have been, and will ever be,
                        the learned and the ignorant, the wise and the heedless, the profligate and the pious.
                        That a wise and reflecting soul should commit a heinous deed is most improbable, inasmuch
                        as such a person either seeketh after this world or hath forsaken it: If he be of
                        the latter, he would assuredly have no regard for aught else besides God, and moreover
                        the fear of God would deter him from unlawful and reprehensible actions; and if he
                        be of the former, he would just as assuredly avoid such deeds as would alienate and
                        alarm the people, and act in such a manner as to earn their confidence and trust.
                        It is therefore evident that reprehensible actions have always emanated, and will
                        ever emanate, from ignorant and foolish souls. We implore God to guard His servants
                        from turning to anyone save Him, and to draw them nigh unto His presence. His might,
                        in truth, is equal to all things.

                        If the call I have raised be wholly for Thy sake, then draw thereby the hearts of

                        a wretched act, there still remain some who commit it. The punishment which this act
                        entaileth, however, applieth only to its heedless perpetrators, whilst those noble
                        manifestations of supreme sanctity remain exalted above and exempt from all blame.

                        Chosen Ones—may the souls of all mankind be offered up for His sake! After the Daystar
                        of Truth dawned above the horizon of Ḥijáz, how great were the cruelties which the
                        exponents of error inflicted upon that incomparable Manifestation of the All-Glorious!
                        Such was their heedlessness that they regarded every injury inflicted upon that sacred
                        Being as ranking among the greatest of all acts, and constituting a means of attainment
                        unto God, the Most High. For in the early years of His mission the divines of that
                        age, both Christian and Jewish, turned away from that Daystar of the heaven of glory,
                        whereupon all people, high and low alike, bestirred themselves to extinguish the light
                        of that Luminary of the horizon of inner meanings. The names of all these divines
                        have been mentioned in the books of old; among them are Wahb ibn-i-Ráhib, Ka‘b ibn-i-A<u>sh</u>raf, ‘Abdu’lláh-i-Ubayy, and others of their like.

                        to shed His pure blood, even as God—glorified be His mention!—saith: “And remember
                        when the disbelievers schemed against Thee, that they might lay hold upon Thee, or
                        slay Thee, or cast Thee out; and so they schemed, and God schemed, and God, verily,
                        is the best of schemers.”<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#700012929">[36]</a></sup> Again He saith: “But if their opposition be grievous to Thee—if Thou canst, seek
                        out an opening into the earth or a ladder into heaven and bring to them a sign; yet
                        if God wished, He could gather them unto true guidance; be Thou not, then, of the
                        ignorant.”<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#023462546">[37]</a></sup> By God! The hearts of His favoured ones are consumed at the purport of these two
                        blessed verses. Such established and undisputed facts have been forgotten, and no
                        one hath paused to reflect, in days past or in this day, upon the things that have
                        prompted men to turn away from the Revealers of the light of God at the time of their
                        manifestation.

                        of Mary. When that Manifestation of the All-Merciful revealed Himself, all the divines
                        charged that Quintessence of faith with impiety and rebellion. Eventually, with the
                        sanction of Annas, the most learned of the divines of His day, and Caiaphas, the high
                        priest, His blessed person was made to suffer that which the pen is ashamed to mention
                        and powerless to describe. The wide world in all its vastness could no longer contain
                        Him, until at last God raised Him up unto heaven.

                        lead to weariness. The doctors of the Torah in particular assert that no independent
                        Prophet will come after Moses with a new Law. They maintain that a Scion of the House
                        of David shall be made manifest Who will promulgate the Law of the Torah, and help
                        establish and enforce its commandments throughout the East and the West.

                        Son of Mary—peace be upon Him! In support of this contention, they adduce the following
                        verse from the Gospel: “Heaven and earth shall pass away, but the words of the Son
                        of Man shall never pass away.”<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#471485661">[38]</a></sup> They maintain that neither the teachings nor the commandments of Jesus—peace be upon

                        the All-Merciful, passed over Me, awoke Me from My slumber, and bade Me lift up My
                        voice betwixt earth and heaven. This thing is not from Me, but from God. Unto this
                        testify the dwellers of His Dominion and of His Kingdom, and the inhabitants of the
                        cities of His unfading glory. By Him Who is the Truth! I fear no tribulation in His
                        path, nor any affliction in My love for Him and in the way of His good pleasure. Verily
                        God hath made adversity as a morning dew upon His green pasture, and a wick for His
                        lamp which lighteth earth and heaven.

                     call thou to mind the time when Muḥammad came with clear tokens from Him Who is the
                     Almighty, the All-Knowing. The people were wont to pelt Him with stones from hidden
                     places and in the markets, and they rejected the signs of God, thy Lord and the Lord
                     of thy forefathers. The learned also denied Him, as did their followers, and likewise
                     the kings of the earth, as thou hast heard from the tales of old. Among those kings
                     was Chosroes,<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#889788880">[52]</a></sup> to whom Muḥammad sent a blessed epistle summoning him unto God and forbidding him

                     evil and corrupt desires, however, Chosroes waxed arrogant before God and tore up
                     the Tablet. He, verily, is accounted among the inmates of the nethermost fire.

                     ear to the very atoms of the earth proclaiming: “This is the Best-Beloved of the worlds!”
                     The dwellers of the earth have wronged Him and failed to recognize the One Whose name

                     as well as the benevolent soul, the contented soul, the soul pleasing unto God, the
                     inspired soul, the irascible soul, and the concupiscent soul. Every group hath its
                     own pronouncements concerning the soul and We are disinclined to dwell upon the sayings

                     of things and after their maturation, as thou dost observe in the germ: once it hath
                     developed to its predestined stage, God manifesteth the soul that was latent within
                     it. Thy Lord, verily, doeth what He willeth and ordaineth what He pleaseth.

                     the waters of opposition nor the oceans of the world can quench its flame. That soul
                     is indeed a fire ablaze in the tree of man which proclaimeth: “No God is there but

                     unto thee that thou mayest recognize the Soul of God which hath appeared above the

                     of love and contentment, then it will be related to the All-Merciful, and should it
                     fly in the atmosphere of self and desire, then it will pertain to the Evil One; may
                     God shield and protect us and protect you therefrom, O ye who perceive! Should the
                     soul become ignited with the fire of the love of God, it is called benevolent and
                     pleasing unto God, but should it be consumed with the fire of passion, it is known
                     as the concupiscent soul. Thus have We expounded this subject for thee that thou mayest
                     obtain a clear understanding.

                     that which shall enable him to dispense with the sayings of men. Say: Spirit, mind,
                     soul, and the powers of sight and hearing are but one single reality which hath manifold
                     expressions owing to the diversity of its instruments. As thou dost observe, man’s
                     power to comprehend, move, speak, hear, and see all derive from this sign of his Lord
                     within him. It is single in its essence, yet manifold through the diversity of its
                     instruments. This, verily, is a certain truth. For example, if it directeth its attention
                     to the means of hearing, then hearing and its attributes become manifest. Likewise,
                     if it directeth itself to the means of vision, a different effect and attribute appear.
                     Reflect upon this subject that thou mayest comprehend the true meaning of what hath
                     been intended, find thyself independent of the sayings of the people, and be of them
                     that are well assured. In like manner, when this sign of God turneth towards the brain,
                     the head, and such means, the powers of the mind and the soul are manifested. Thy
                     Lord, verily, is potent to do whatsoever He pleaseth.

                     Him Who is the Almighty, the All-Praised. Thus have We chosen to be concise in this

                     from this cup. Thy Lord, verily, is the All-Bountiful and unassailable in His power.

                     Grieve not at what hath befallen Us and thee in the path of God. Rest assured and
                     persevere. He, verily, rendereth victorious those who love Him, and His might is equal
                     to all things. Whoso turneth unto Him brighteneth thereby the faces of the Concourse
                     on high, and unto this God Himself is My witness.

                     Youth hath sought nothing from thee or from such as are like unto thee, inasmuch as
                     from time immemorial, whenever the Manifestations of the All-Merciful and the Exponents
                     of His unfading glory have stepped out of the Realm of eternity into this mortal world
                     and revealed themselves to revive the dead, men such as thee have considered these
                     sanctified Souls and Temples of Divine Oneness, upon Whom must needs depend the rehabilitation
                     of the peoples of the earth, to be stirrers of mischief and worthy of blame. These
                     men, verily, have all returned unto dust. Thou, too, shalt erelong take abode therein
                     and find thyself in grievous loss.

                     and wrath? No faith or religion hath ever held children responsible. The Pen of divine
                     Command hath exempted them, yet the fire of thy tyranny and oppression encompasseth
                     all. If thou bearest allegiance to any faith or religion, then thou shouldst know
                     that, according to all the heavenly Books and all the divinely inspired and weighty
                     Scriptures, children are not to be held accountable. Aside from this, not even those
                     who disbelieve in God have perpetrated such unseemly acts. Since from every thing
                     an effect becometh manifest, a fact that none can deny save those who are bereft of
                     reason and understanding, it is certain that the sighs of these children and the cries
                     of these wronged ones will have their due consequence.

                     in your domains, nor disobeyed your government, but rather kept to themselves and
                     engaged day and night in the remembrance of God. Later, when the order was issued
                     to banish this Youth, all were filled with dismay. The officials in charge of My expulsion
                     declared, however: “These others have not been charged with any offence and have not
                     been expelled by the government. Should they desire to accompany you, no one will
                     oppose them.” These hapless souls therefore paid their own expenses, forsook all their
                     possessions, and, contenting themselves with Our presence and placing their whole
                     trust in God, journeyed once again with Him until the fortress of ‘Akká became the
                     prison of Bahá.

                     young and old alike, in the army barracks. The first night all were deprived of either
                     food or drink, for the sentries were guarding the gate of the barracks and permitted
                     no one to leave. No one gave a thought to the plight of these wronged ones. They even
                     begged for water, and were refused.

                     or ignorant, rich or poor, bore witness to the purity and sanctity of these servants.
                     At the time this Youth was departing from Adrianople, one of the loved ones of God
                     attempted to take his own life, so unbearable to him was the sight of this Wronged
                     One in the hands of His oppressors. During the journey we were thrice compelled to
                     change ships, and it is evident how much the children suffered as a result. Upon disembarking,
                     four of the believers were separated and prevented from accompanying Us. As this Youth
                     was leaving, one of the four, named ‘Abdu’l-<u>Gh</u>affár, cast himself into the sea, and no one knoweth what befell him thereafter.<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#455792153">[56]</a></sup>

                     have assigned each prisoner, from the government storehouse, a daily allowance of
                     three loaves of bread that no one can eat. From the foundation of the world until

                     dominions will be disrupted. Then will ye bewail and lament, and will find none to

                     souls, for they have been so intoxicated with the wine of the All-Merciful and are
                     so carried away with the inebriating effect of the living waters of His loving providence
                     that even were they to suffer all the cruelties of the world for His sake, they would
                     remain content and yield thanks unto Him. These souls have never held, nor shall they
                     ever hold, any grievance. Nay, their blood continually imploreth and beseecheth the
                     Lord of the worlds that it might be spilt upon the dust in His path, and their heads
                     yearn to be borne aloft on spears for the sake of the Beloved of hearts and souls.

                     <a id="546226407" class="brl-location"></a>When I was still a child and had not yet attained the age of maturity, My father made
                     arrangements in Ṭihrán for the marriage of one of My older brothers, and as is customary
                     in that city, the festivities lasted for seven days and seven nights. On the last
                     day it was announced that the play “<u>Sh</u>áh Sulṭán Salím” would be presented. A large number of princes, dignitaries, and notables
                     of the capital gathered for the occasion. I was sitting in one of the upper rooms
                     of the building and observing the scene. Presently a tent was pitched in the courtyard,
                     and before long some small human-like figures, each appearing to be no more than about
                     a hand’s span in height, were seen to emerge from it and raise the call: “His Majesty
                     is coming! Arrange the seats at once!” Other figures then came forth, some of whom
                     were seen to be engaged in sweeping, others in sprinkling water, and thereafter another,
                     who was announced as the chief town crier, raised his call and bade the people assemble
                     for an audience with the king. Next, several groups of figures made their appearance
                     and took their places, the first attired in hats and sashes after the Persian fashion,
                     the second wielding battleaxes, and the third comprising a number of footmen and executioners
                     carrying bastinados. Finally there appeared, arrayed in regal majesty and crowned
                     with a royal diadem, a kingly figure, bearing himself with the utmost haughtiness
                     and grandeur, at turns advancing and pausing in his progress, who proceeded with great
                     solemnity, poise and dignity to seat himself upon his throne.

                     <a id="665245110" class="brl-location"></a>At that moment a volley of shots was fired, a fanfare of trumpets was sounded, and
                     king and tent were enveloped in a pall of smoke. When it had cleared, the king, ensconced
                     upon his throne, was seen surrounded by a suite of ministers, princes, and dignitaries
                     of state who, having taken their places, were standing at attention in his presence.
                     A captured thief was then brought before the king, who gave the order that the offender
                     should be beheaded. Without a moment’s delay the chief executioner cut off the thief’s
                     head, whence a blood-like liquid came forth. After this the king held audience with
                     his court, during which intelligence was received that a rebellion had broken out
                     on a certain frontier. Thereupon the king reviewed his troops and despatched several
                     regiments supported by artillery to quell the uprising. A few moments later cannons
                     were heard booming from behind the tent, and it was announced that a battle had been
                     engaged.

                     all created things! Ever since that day, all the trappings of the world have seemed
                     in the eyes of this Youth akin to that same spectacle. They have never been, nor will
                     they ever be, of any weight and consequence, be it to the extent of a grain of mustard
                     seed. How greatly I marveled that men should pride themselves upon such vanities,
                     whilst those possessed of insight, ere they witness any evidence of human glory, perceive
                     with certainty the inevitability of its waning. “Never have I looked upon any thing
                     save that I have seen extinction before it; and God, verily, is a sufficient witness!”

                     Should one fail to attain unto the recognition of Him Who is the Eternal Truth, let
                     him at least conduct himself with reason and justice. Erelong these outward trappings,
                     these visible treasures, these earthly vanities, these arrayed armies, these adorned
                     vestures, these proud and overweening souls, all shall pass into the confines of the
                     grave, as though into that box. In the eyes of those possessed of insight, all this
                     conflict, contention and vainglory hath ever been, and will ever be, like unto the
                     play and pastimes of children. Take heed, and be not of them that see and yet deny.

                     of negligence, and cease to oppose unjustly the servants of God. So long as thy power

                     riches and poverty, tranquillity and tribulation, all will pass away, and all the
                     peoples of the earth will erelong be laid to rest in their tombs. It behoveth therefore
                     every man of insight to fix his gaze upon the goal of eternity, that perchance by
                     the grace of Him Who is the Ancient King he may attain unto the immortal Kingdom and
                     abide beneath the shade of the Tree of His Revelation.

                     who, in his drunkenness, became attracted to a dog, took it in his embrace, and made
                     it his plaything, and who, when the morn of discernment dawned and the light of the
                     sun enveloped the horizon, realized that the object of his affection was but a dog.

                     not need to be accompanied by officers and soldiers. Upon our arrival in Gallipoli,
                     a major by the name of ‘Umar came into Our presence. God is well aware of what he
                     said. After some exchanges in which his own innocence and thy guilt were mentioned,
                     We declared: “From the outset, a gathering should have been convened at which the
                     learned men of this age could have met with this Youth in order to determine what
                     offence these servants have committed. But now the matter hath gone beyond such considerations,
                     and, according to thine own assertion, thou art charged with incarcerating Us in the
                     most desolate of cities. There is a matter, which, if thou findest it possible, I
                     request thee to submit to His Majesty the Sulṭán, that for ten minutes this Youth
                     be enabled to meet him, so that he may demand whatsoever he deemeth as a sufficient
                     testimony and regardeth as proof of the veracity of Him Who is the Truth. Should God
                     enable Him to produce it, let him, then, release these wronged ones, and leave them
                     to themselves.”

                     <a id="856966089" class="brl-location"></a>He promised to transmit this message, and to give Us his reply. We received, however,
                     no news from him. Although it becometh not Him Who is the Truth to present Himself
                     before any person, inasmuch as all have been created to obey Him, yet in view of the
                     condition of these little children and the large number of women so far removed from
                     their friends and countries, We have acquiesced in this matter. In spite of this nothing
                     hath resulted. ‘Umar himself is alive and accessible. Inquire from him, that the truth
                     may be made known unto you.

                     except God, the Almighty, the All-Knowing. In the days following Our arrival, two
                     of these servants hastened to the realms above. For an entire day the guards insisted
                     that, until they were paid for the shrouds and burial, those blessed bodies could
                     not be removed, although no one had requested any help from them. At that time we
                     were devoid of earthly means, and pleaded that they leave the matter unto us and allow
                     those present to carry the bodies, but they refused. Finally, a carpet was taken to
                     the bazaar to be sold, and the sum obtained was delivered to the guards. Later, it
                     was learned that they had merely dug a shallow grave into which they had placed both
                     blessed bodies, although they had taken twice the amount required for shrouds and
                     burial.

                     dost possess and in which thou dost rejoice, and choose to abide in one of the dilapidated
                     rooms of this Most Great Prison. Beseech God to grant thee such mature understanding
                     as to enable thee to distinguish praiseworthy actions from those which merit blame.

                     iniquity, in which he mocked God and recorded that which filled all created things

                     comprehend its meaning, and perchance they may forsake all they possess, turn towards

                     fruit-laden Tree, that hath sprung out of the Crimson Hill, upon the holy Plain, intoning
                     the words: “There is none other God but He, the Mighty, the All-Powerful, the All-Wise.”
                     This is a Spot which hath been sanctified by God for those who approach it, a Spot
                     wherein His Voice may be heard from the celestial Tree of Holiness. Fear God, O concourse
                     of kings, and suffer not yourselves to be deprived of this most sublime grace. Fling
                     away, then, the things ye possess, and take fast hold on the Handle of God, the Exalted,
                     the Great. Set your hearts towards the Face of God, and abandon that which your desires
                     have bidden you to follow, and be not of those who perish.

                     in His hands a testimony and proof from God, and holy and blessed tokens from Him.
                     Ye, however, O kings, have failed to heed the Remembrance of God in His days and to
                     be guided by the lights which arose and shone forth above the horizon of a resplendent
                     Heaven. Ye examined not His Cause when so to do would have been better for you than
                     all that the sun shineth upon, could ye but perceive it. Ye remained careless until
                     the divines of Persia—those cruel ones—pronounced judgement against Him, and unjustly
                     slew Him. His spirit ascended unto God, and the eyes of the inmates of Paradise and
                     the angels that are nigh unto Him wept sore by reason of this cruelty. Beware that
                     ye be not careless henceforth as ye have been careless aforetime. Return, then, unto
                     God, your Maker, and be not of the heedless.

                     <a id="222283251" class="brl-location"></a>Say: The Sun of vicegerency hath dawned, the Point of knowledge and wisdom hath been
                     made plain, and the Testimony of God, the Almighty, the All-Wise, hath been made manifest.
                     Say: The Moon of eternity hath risen in the midmost heaven, and its light hath illumined
                     the dwellers of the realms above. My face hath come forth from the veils, and shed
                     its radiance upon all that is in heaven and on earth; and yet, ye turned not towards
                     Him, notwithstanding that ye were created for Him, O concourse of kings! Follow, therefore,
                     that which I speak unto you, and hearken unto it with your hearts, and be not of such
                     as have turned aside. For your glory consisteth not in your sovereignty, but rather
                     in your nearness unto God and your observance of His command as sent down in His holy
                     and preserved Tablets. Should any one of you rule over the whole earth, and over all
                     that lieth within it and upon it, its seas, its lands, its mountains, and its plains,
                     and yet be not remembered by God, all these would profit him not, could ye but know

                     of Paradise, but ye have neglected it and chosen to persist in your waywardness. Guidance
                     hath been given unto you from God, but ye have failed to follow it and preferred to
                     reject its truth. The Lamp of God hath been lit within the niche of His Cause, but
                     ye have neglected to seek the radiance of its glory and to draw nigh unto its light.

                     the shell of His radiant heart, may be revealed unto you. Such is the counsel that
                     shall profit you most; make of it your provision, that ye may be of those who are
                     guided aright. Beware lest ye hinder the breeze of God from blowing over your hearts,
                     the breeze through which the hearts of such as have turned unto Him can be quickened.

                     It is We Who have sought you, and yet, behold how ye refused to receive Us! By God!
                     This is a sore injustice that ye have perpetrated—an injustice with which no earthly
                     injustice can measure. To this the Almighty is Himself a witness.

                     brothers, and took captive the remainder of his family. So did it come to pass in
                     an earlier age, and God, verily, is a witness unto My words. Of his lineage there
                     survived none, whether young or old, save his son ‘Alí al-Awsat, known as Zaynu’l-‘Ábidín.

                     fervour and longing at last seized the reins of patience from his grasp, and the love
                     of Him Who is the All-Compelling so enraptured his heart that he surrendered his soul,
                     his spirit, his substance, and his all in the path of God, the Lord of the worlds.
                     By God! Sweeter was this in his sight than the empire of earth and heaven. For the

                     <a id="361601977" class="brl-location"></a>Say: That same fire now blazeth in Mine own breast, and My wish is that this Ḥusayn
                     may lay down His life in like manner, in the hope of attaining unto so august and
                     sublime a station, that station wherein the servant dieth to himself and liveth in
                     God, the Almighty, the Exalted, the Great. Were I to disclose unto you the mysteries
                     which God hath enshrined therein, ye would, of a truth, offer up your lives in His
                     path, renounce your riches, and forsake all that ye possess, that ye might attain
                     this transcendent and all-glorious station. God, however, hath veiled your hearts
                     and obscured your eyes, lest ye should apprehend His mysteries and be made aware of
                     their meaning.

                     <a id="813158417" class="brl-location"></a>Say: The sincere soul longeth for nearness to God even as the suckling babe yearneth
                     for its mother’s breast, nay more ardent is his longing, could ye but know it! Again,
                     his longing is even as the panting of one sore athirst after the living waters of
                     grace, or the yearning of the sinner for forgiveness and mercy. Thus do We expound
                     unto you the mysteries of the Cause, and impart unto you what shall render you independent
                     of all that hath so far occupied you, that perchance ye may enter the Court of Holiness
                     within this exalted Paradise. I swear by God! Whoso entereth therein shall never abandon
                     its precincts, and whoso gazeth thereon shall never turn away therefrom, even should
                     the swords of infidels and deniers rain blows upon him. Thus have We related unto
                     you that which befell Ḥusayn, and We beseech God that He may destine for Us that which
                     He had decreed for him. He, verily, is the Most Generous, the All-Bountiful.

                     over all things, the proof of God was perfected, and His testimony made manifest to
                     all men. And after him God raised up a people who avenged his death, who slew his
                     enemies, and who wept over him at dawn and at eventide. Say: God hath pledged in His
                     Book to lay hold upon every oppressor for his tyranny, and to uproot the stirrers
                     of mischief. Know ye that such holy deeds exert, in themselves, a great influence
                     upon the world of being—an influence which is, however, inscrutable to all save those
                     whose eyes have been opened by God, whose hearts He hath freed from obscuring veils,
                     and whose souls He hath guided aright.

                     verily, is the fiercest of avengers.

                     heed My warning. Wherefore, hearken ye unto My speech, and return ye to God and repent,
                     that He, through His grace, may have mercy upon you, may wash away your sins, and
                     forgive your trespasses. The greatness of His mercy surpasseth the fury of His wrath,
                     and His grace encompasseth all who have been called into being and been clothed with
                     the robe of life, be they of the past or of the future.

                     is My soul! Our intention hath been to make clear that We oppose not the commands
                     of the sovereign, nor are We to be numbered with the rebellious. Know ye of a certainty
                     that all the treasures of the earth, all the gold, the silver, and the rare and precious
                     gems they contain, are, in the sight of God, of His chosen ones and His loved ones,
                     as worthless as a handful of clay. For erelong all that is on earth shall perish,
                     and the kingdom will remain unto God, the All-Powerful, the Incomparable. That which

                     whisperings of the Evil One in your souls. Follow rather the Cause of God, both in
                     your outward and your inner lives, and be not of the heedless. Better is this for
                     you than all that ye have laid up in your houses, and all that ye have sought by day
                     and night.

                     light of God. This, indeed, shall enable you to dispense with all save God, and to

                     of such ministers as these. Lay not aside the fear of God, and be thou of them that
                     act uprightly. Gather around thee those ministers from whom thou canst perceive the
                     fragrance of faith and of justice, and take thou counsel with them, and choose whatever
                     is best in thy sight, and be of them that act generously.

                     one and undivided. Cleave thou, therefore, with the whole affection of thine heart,
                     unto His love, and withdraw it from the love of anyone besides Him, that He may aid
                     thee to immerse thyself in the ocean of His unity, and enable thee to become a true
                     upholder of His oneness. God is My witness. My sole purpose in revealing to thee these

                     to the city which they regard as the abode of rebels. Upon our arrival, We could find
                     no house in which to dwell, and perforce resided in a place where none would enter
                     save the most indigent stranger. There We lodged for a time, after which, suffering
                     increasingly from the confined space, We sought and rented houses which by reason
                     of the extreme cold had been vacated by their occupants. Thus in the depth of winter
                     we were constrained to make our abode in houses wherein none dwell except in the heat

                     of all worlds! We have set forth the whole matter before thee, that perchance thou
                     might realize what thou hast done, might desist from inflicting on others the hurt
                     thou hast inflicted on Us, and might be of them that have truly repented to God, Who

                     have We created you, and unto it will We return you, and out of it will We bring you
                     forth a second time.”<sup class="brl-note brl-endnote"><a href="#292792686">[80]</a></sup> This is what God ordained unto all them that dwell on earth, be they high or low.
                     It behoveth not, therefore, him who was created from dust, who will return unto it,
                     and will again be brought forth out of it, to swell with pride before God, and before
                     His loved ones, to proudly scorn them, and be filled with disdainful arrogance. Nay,
                     rather it behoveth thee and those like thee to submit yourselves to them Who are the
                     Manifestations of the unity of God, and to defer humbly to the faithful, who have
                     forsaken their all for the sake of God, and have detached themselves from the things
                     which engross men’s attention, and lead them astray from the path of God, the All-Glorious,
                     the All-Praised. Thus do We send down upon you that which shall profit you and profit
                     them that have placed their whole trust and confidence in their Lord.

                     not Our presence, when so to do would have been better for you than all your doings.
                     Know ye that the Sun of vicegerency hath dawned in all truth, and yet ye have turned

                     of this Wronged One, Who hath been so afflicted by men that they dealt with Him as

                     present volume. These passages account for approximately one third of the text. The
                     committees and individuals appointed to prepare the translations faced the challenge
                     of rendering the balance of the Text in a manner at once faithful to the meaning of
                     the original and consistent with the exalted English style established by the Guardian
                     for the translation of Bahá’u’lláh’s matchless utterance.
